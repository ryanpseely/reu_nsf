The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Current trends in the development of new products and technologies may lead to the release of bioengineered organisms into the environment. While much work is done to develop such technologies, their environmental effects get less attention. More work is needed to understand and predict the impacts of bioengineered organisms. In this proposal, the Fellow will study how bioengineered organisms affect the environment by studying their DNA, traits, and interactions with other organisms. This research will involve high school interns, agricultural laborers, and artists. The purpose of the work is to develop a fairer approach to bioengineering, making sure that the development of such technology considers both people and the planet.<br/><br/>The fellow will use a combination of engineering, experimental, and observational approaches to describe the effects of introduced genetic variation on population-level traits, community stability, and ecosystem functioning. This project investigates a Rule of Life (RoL) by connecting the mechanistic relationships between genomes and phenomes of bioengineered organisms to ecological processes such as community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Using a system of plant-associated soil microbes, the fellow will use genetic engineering to create microbial consortia and study its effects on community and ecosystem processes. The research will show whether individual genetic changes affect community assembly and ecosystem functioning in this system. Results will advance theoretical predictions about the effects of extreme trait variation on ecological and evolutionary processes.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Wildlife viruses are a major global health concern as most microbes known to infect humans have origins in animals. Interfaces where humans and wildlife meet such as markets and deforestation areas are hotspots for viral emergence and spillover. These activities are often concentrated in countries with immense biodiversity and thus viral diversity, yet economic pressures to encroach upon natural spaces is also increasing at a rapid pace.<br/>Preventing the next global pandemic will require a One Health approach that considers the inherent connections between human, animal, and environmental health. Beyond advancing scientific research and technological advancements, improving pandemic preparedness will also require greater public education and awareness of One Health, active engagement with stakeholders and policymakers, and a renewed urgency for wildlife and environmental conservation.<br/><br/>This research aims to study how deforestation in Cambodia affects wildlife viral diversity and evolution. Using hybridization capture based metagenomic methods, this project will detect known and uncover novel viruses from rodent, mosquito, and environmental samples. The viral genomic sequences generated will be used along with climate and environmental data to characterize zoonotic potential for spillover risk modeling. In addition to hands-on research training in cutting-edge molecular, bioinformatic, and modelling methods for viral discovery, surveillance, and risk assessment, the fellow will also develop translatable skills within public science communication, applied conservation, and public health while enmeshed in multiple international non-profit and academic environments including the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the University of Calgary, the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, and Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC). The fellow will also collaborate with the WCS Education Department to create online science and conservation education modules focused on genomic-based wildlife disease surveillance and its role in One Health, which will be implemented through local outreach efforts with WCS Cambodia and the IPC Virology Unit in Cambodia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting how organisms will react to climate change is challenging because their responses can seem random or unique to each individual. Linking processes that drive individual responses to outcomes at the level of populations or species could improve predictions. This project?s main goal is to study how two factors, changes to DNA structure and relationships with microbes, affect responses to the environment. The project investigates patterns in these factors across environments and over time in a grasshopper species. The project will test how including these factors improves predictions of the impacts of climate change. The fellow will partner with teachers and students at a local community college to find the best methods of explaining the impacts of climate change to broad audiences. The fellow will also involve community college and transfer students in the research process.<br/><br/>The project investigates a rare combination of two significant emerging mechanisms in the study of ecological and evolutionary responses to variation in the environment: CpG methylation and microbiomes. Using a combination of approaches, the fellow will test the hypothesis that epigenetic changes and symbiotic relationships help to relax fitness constraints by improving survival at low elevation and easing temperature constraints on energy gain and fecundity at high elevation. The fellow will first characterize natural patterns in methylation and microbiomes across elevation, while controlling for genotype by using a field reciprocal transplant experiment. Next, laboratory common garden experiments will establish links between specific environmental factors and their effects on symbionts, methylation patterns, and phenotypic outcomes. Complementarily, experiments manipulating the microbiome, by feeding grasshoppers with sterile, antibiotic, or probiotic-treated food, will elucidate relationships between the microbiome, methylation levels, and phenotypic outcomes under controlled environments. Lastly, the fellow will analyze patterns in methylation and microbiomes over time in museum specimens, and use historical-contemporary comparisons to test whether these factors can better predict the impact of climate change on this grasshopper system. The fellow will gain teaching experience through her broader impacts plan, and increase the scope of approaches she uses to tackle her research questions by learning epigenetic methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sedimentary provenance analysis is widely used across the Earth sciences to reconstruct ancient sediment dispersal networks, source-to-sink sediment budgets, sedimentary basin evolution, and to discern links between tectonics, paleogeography, climate, and biology. However, provenance methods that exclusively focus on studying the age distributions and chemistry of the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4) in sedimentary environments are limited in tracking detritus sourced from mafic and metamorphic rocks. This limitation is especially pronounced in continental collision settings, where obducted fragments of oceanic crust and exhumed metamorphic massifs are common sources of sediment but whose cryptic provenance signatures impose limits on the ability to perform accurate geodynamic and paleogeographic reconstructions. This research investigates the applicability of combined traditional and non-traditional sedimentary provenance methods to reconstruct sedimentary provenance during the transition from continental collision to tectonic escape in the Ulukisla Basin in south-central Turkiye. This study develops workflows for novel, emerging sedimentary provenance techniques that can be applied to tectonic settings worldwide and aid in addressing outstanding questions in the Earth sciences. The project supports field- and laboratory-based training and research experience for undergraduate students in the United States and Turkiye.<br/><br/>Accurately reconstructing the timing and dynamics of continental collisions in modern and deep-time settings remains a key challenge for the tectonics community. However, a growing body of work suggests that sedimentary basins may hold the most complete record of subduction, accretion, collision, and escape. Utilizing the deformational, magmatic, and metamorphic information preserved in detrital minerals thereby provides a way to unite proxy records into a holistic model of collisional evolution. This project leverages the U-Pb, Hf, Nd, and trace element composition of detrital zircon, rutile, and titanite, to track sedimentary provenance from igneous and metamorphic sources. This study will create a proof-of-concept workflow for detrital petrochronology applied to sedimentary basin analysis. Furthermore, these datasets establish quantitative relationships between the timing, tempo, and spatial extent of magmatism, metamorphism, deformation, crustal thickness, and exhumation. Using this multi-proxy approach, this project aims to document the spatial and temporal evolution of continental collision and tectonic escape. The results will inform future work in sedimentary provenance analysis and continental collision settings from modern and ancient orogens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fault failure can occur at a range of slip speeds varying from slow creep (cm/year) to fast earthquakes (m/s) and this rate of failure depends on the friction (resistance to sliding) of the fault. Therefore, understanding where and when earthquakes happen requires a frictional model. The predominant model is a set of equations that fit laboratory data called rate and state friction. While these equations have been generally useful, they do not include any underlying physics of the system. Because of this, scientists are unable to extrapolate results to pressure and temperature conditions not directly explored in the lab. Due to experimental constraints, many pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the earth are not attainable. Recently, a new frictional model has been defined, where the frictional state is governed by the permanent deformation of grains during sliding. This permanent deformation is called plastic deformation, and adds shear strength to the system, called backstress. While this model can fit experiments similar to rate and state friction, the effect of backstress on friction has not been investigated systematically in the laboratory. This project will vary the amount of backstress in the starting grains and then perform friction experiments on this material. Preliminary experiments at 550°C and 100 MPa normal stress show that the amount of backstress in the starting grains causes a large change in the amount of shear stress required to slide the material at a steady state. Testing and enhancing this new model will allow for better predictions of the conditions that allow for earthquakes versus slower slip. Outside of this research, Dr. Okamoto will mentor students through the Research Opportunities in Rock Deformation (RORD) REU at UMN and co-supervise an undergraduate research project. Dr. Okamoto will also engage with and aid in ongoing initiatives at UMN that aim to promote diversity and support geoscientists from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This work will further investigate this new model by determining the velocity dependence of materials over a range of pressure and temperature conditions that may span deformation mechanisms such as dilation, fracture, and plastic deformation at grain contacts. At conditions relevant to plasticity, the steady-state friction coefficient as well as the frictional rate-dependence will depend on backstress, but when temperatures and pressures are low, the effect of plasticity will be low, and friction should be a function of dilation rather than backstress. When pressures are high and temperature is low, friction should mostly depend on the ability of the grains to fracture. However, there is a feedback between backstress and fracture that is currently unmapped. Backstress is fundamentally caused by additions of small separations in the crystal lattice called dislocations. The dependence of the ability for grains to fracture on dislocation density will be explored through novel indentation techniques. This will enable a better understanding of how the frictional system at low temperatures and high pressures will behave. Overall, exploring whether friction depends on backstress over a wide parameter range will be fundamental to extrapolating laboratory friction to pressure/temperature conditions not explored in the lab as well as to larger spatial and temporal scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Caldera collapse has occurred during the largest explosive eruptions in Earth?s history, but also during multiple eruptions in the past few decades. However, the factors controlling the time evolution of caldera collapse eruptions are poorly understood, which limits our ability to infer past eruptive conditions and make forecasts about ongoing or future eruptions. This project will develop caldera collapse simulations that include both earthquakes and magma dynamics, then compare simulations to various types of geologic data and volcano monitoring data. The project will quantify controls on caldera collapse eruption evolution and constrain important rock and magma system properties at several volcanoes, including K?lauea in Hawaii. In addition to communicating results to volcano observatories, immersive animations and sonifications of the 2018 K?lauea eruption will be produced for broader outreach.<br/><br/>This project will study temporal dynamics of caldera collapse in both mafic and silicic eruptions. It will examine what controls eruption episodicity, and how this influences eruptive regimes and overall eruption volume and duration. This project will develop 3D numerical models that couple elastic and multiphase fluid mechanics, including earthquake physics and magma ascent dynamics. Simulations will be compared to geophysical and video data from recent mafic eruptions to constrain ring fault geometry and frictional properties. Simulations will also be compared to geologic and petrologic data from older silicic eruptions to examine how different proposed pre-eruptive reservoir conditions, including magma stratification and melt lens distributions, influence eruptions and the resulting deposits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symbiosis, which describes the interaction between two different organisms, is important to all life on Earth. Parasitism is one form of symbiosis. This project will look at a parasitic plant called the corpse flower, which relies on other plants to survive. It aims to study the relationship between this plant and the insects that pollinate them in their natural habitat. Because these relationships have evolved over millions of years, it is likely that smaller organisms like bacteria and viruses have also evolved with them over time. Bacteria and viruses may also contribute to the transfer of genes among plants, and maybe even between plants and the insects that pollinate them. This study will combine field work and studies of the genomes of bacteria and viruses to add to our understanding of how genes move between different organisms. Also, from this research, science activities will be designed for students to learn more about ecology.<br/><br/>This project will include (1) a comprehensive multi-scale microbial survey of the various bacterial and viral communities across a parasitic plant system (Rafflesiaceae-Tetrastigma); (2) identification and characterization of horizontal gene transfer events within this parasitic plant system; (3) design of microbial interaction networks to assess the structural patterns of horizontal gene transfer within this parasite plant system; (4) development of a science workshop curriculum and outreach activities at various age levels for students to discover biology; and (5) encouragement of substantial independent scientific research experiences for undergraduate students. Moving forward, the findings from this project can better inform ecological models to predict how microbial transmission and horizontal gene transfer events will influence other symbiotic relationships between eukaryotic organisms.

Typically, laws treat environmental entities (such as rivers and mountains) as objects of ownership or protection. The new doctrine proposes a dramatic shift in the ways that laws deal with the environment. The research looks at a sociolegal context where legal experts are struggling to figure out how to implement a law that claims a river is a legal subject. In training a student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis, this research project would develop systems for better understanding of how the rights of nature framework is changing human relationships with the environment. The project also broadens the participation of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>This doctoral research project explores what implications a legal paradigm emphasizing the rights of nature doctrine has for transforming sociolegal relations between human and environmental systems. To carry out this project, the researchers are using a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, the researchers are conducting a series of standardized interviews with judges who have written rights of nature laws. On the other hand, the researchers are using semi-structured observational methods to study a committee that has been judicially mandated as the legal representative of a river. This research design helps the investigators to understand the rights of nature from both the practical side of policy implementation as well as the more theoretical side of policy conceptualization. On a scholarly level, this project contributes to theories in legal anthropological and sociolegal studies about the role of bureaucracy in social life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research will focus on molt, the annual process by which birds lose their old feathers and replace them with new ones. Molt is an essential event in the bird?s annual cycle because feathers wear down over time. To meet the high metabolic demands of feather growth, bird populations have evolved to molt at times and in locations with abundant resources. If, for whatever reason, birds are unable to access sufficient resources during the molting period, they will grow poor quality feathers and have an elevated risk of mortality in the following year. Unfortunately, bird populations may soon face mismatches between periods of feather growth and resource availability as climate change alters patterns of precipitation. In this study, the researcher will assess the extent to which ongoing changes in precipitation challenge bird populations during molt. By describing individual variation and flexibility in molting behavior and the potential for molting behavior to evolve in response to changing conditions, the researcher will help update current climate change risk assessments for bird species in western North America and improve conservation strategies. Additionally, this project will generate outreach materials communicating the importance of studying molt to community scientists across the country and provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, thereby broadening participation in the scientific and birding communities.<br/><br/>The researcher will first describe intraspecific variation in molting behavior in a wide-ranging passerine species, the Lazuli Bunting (Passerina amoena), by examining occurrence records and deploying miniature tracking devices. He will then take individuals from populations with the most divergent molting locations and phenologies into captivity and expose them to different environmental cues that could trigger molt. Following the onset of molting behavior in each captive individual, the researcher will then generate transcriptomic sequences to identify loci associated with molting behavior. By determining the environmental and genomic mechanisms that regulate molt in different populations, the researcher will be able to understand plasticity in molting behavior and the evolutionary potential for populations to shift molting behavior. In all stages of this research, there will be many opportunities to involve undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Samantha Snodgrass is ""Human Domestication of Maize as Bio-cultural Coevolution"". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California (UC) Davis and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra and Dr. Graham Coop.<br/><br/>Plant domestication and agriculture are key innovations underlying the past 10,000 years of human civilization. Domestication alters how plants benefit humans, which can result in tight dependencies. For example, maize cannot survive outside of human cultivation, yet is planted across the globe in extremely different environments because it is a vital food source for humans. While archaeology and genetic research have revealed much about when and where domestication of maize occurred, it is unclear how maize was moved with and among early farmer communities and which traits were important early versus later in the process. This project uses population genetics to create methods addressing these long-standing questions in maize and other crops. Answers may shed light on why some species are hard to domesticate and will guide efforts to domesticate new crops. Training objectives include gaining expertise in statistical population genetics, professional development for managing large, interdisciplinary teams and establishing professional ties with evolutionary biologists, anthropologists, and Mesoamerican foodway scholars at UC Davis to facilitate future collaboration. Broader impacts include developing publicly available undergraduate curricula focused on introducing biology students to the field of population genetics and the possibilities opened by big data in both sequencing and trait-measuring efforts.<br/> <br/>Given the close relationship between farmers and domesticates, several researchers have proposed theoretical models of domestication as bio-cultural coevolution. Current methods to investigate evolution in such systems typically focus on a single species. This project will expand upon those approaches by treating humans and maize as coevolving species. Specifically, project objectives include 1) estimating joint admixture graphs to better understand how maize moved with and among early farmer communities and the timing and strength of selection on traits; 2) estimating signatures of polygenic selection across 200+ traits scored in maize and placing them at specific time periods within the admixture graph to show selection patterns on polygenic traits not retained in the archeological record but important to adaptation such as flowering time; and, 3) applying the results and methods to the study of other American domesticates to test the generality of domestication patterns found in maize. All scripts will be publicly available on GitHub and associated with a publication. All genomic data will come from or be made available on NCBI and/or CyVerse and aggregated trait data will be available on a data platform such as CyVerse and/or Dryad.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Communities of microbes that live in and on animals provide essential functions to one another and their hosts.  Community structure (the types and abundances of microbes present) and function are shaped by interactions between the microbes themselves and also between microbes and their hosts. Diet, especially dietary toxins like caffeine, also contribute to differential community structures, but the ways microbial interactions and dietary toxins act together in shaping communities is not well understood. These studies will contribute to the general body of work describing the dynamic interactions between gut microbiomes and their hosts, and add a new layer (the effects of dietary toxins) to our understanding of the interaction outcomes. This new knowledge can be applied in human health contexts, where gut microbial community dynamics are known to have varied impacts on health, and has a clear application in biocontrol of the coffee berry borer, which contributes to the loss of ~$500 million in revenue in coffee growing regions. This project will also broaden participation and inclusion of underrepresented groups in biology through scientific and professional training of early career scientists and facilitating training on conflict resolution using restorative justice techniques.<br/><br/>This project will combine observational and experimental studies to better understand the dynamics of the microbial community and dietary toxins on community structure and function in the gut microbiome of the coffee pest, Hypothenemus hampei.

Small mammals in particular help maintain healthy soils, spread seeds and ensure they germinate, and feed predators (for example, owls that eat mice). As humans use natural resources and contribute to climate change, we need to identify ways to conserve small mammal diversity. This project will help us understand how some small mammals, like woodrats and ground squirrels, in the Great Basin of the western U.S. responded to past changes in vegetation and episodes of climate drying that are in some ways similar to what?s happening now. Specifically, by analyzing small mammal bones deposited in caves over the past 16,000 years, we will test ideas about 1) which types of small mammals are particularly sensitive to climate drying and 2) whether ongoing changes in climate or land use are a greater threat to these animals today. Results from this research will help people make decisions about biodiversity conservation and land use planning. Findings will also be shared with the general public so that everyone can learn how understanding the past can help us do a better job of caring for our planet today. <br/><br/>Despite clear evidence that climate disruption and human activities threaten biodiversity, ecological studies typically fall short of identifying the cross-scale responses of species and their communities to accelerating environmental change.

This project combines taxon-specific stable isotope and AMS 14C chronologies with existing paleoenvironmental proxies to characterize the divergent responses of specialist and generalist small mammals in the Great Basin to aridification over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Study of mesic and xeric-adapted pairs of species belonging to both woodrats (Neotoma spp.) and ground squirrels (Urocitellus spp.) will test the extent to which paleoecological patterns can predict the habitat use of modern populations.

The goal of this REU Site is to create an undergraduate research fellowship program. One of the two major aims of this program is to improve the diversity of our scientists. To improve the education, training, and subsequent representation of diverse populations in psychology, we will provide students from underrepresented backgrounds with rigorous research training so that they are better prepared to pursue a future career in STEM. Our second major aim is to improve the diversity of our science. Unfortunately, in most published research, variation based on context, socio-economic status and race, for example, is difficult to study, as our samples are not representative of the general US population. Instead of controlling for variability based on socio-emotional context, in this proposal, we seek to study it directly in an attempt to find systematic relations between this variability and basic neural, cognitive, and social processes. Overall, it is our hope that this training program will not only create a more diverse next generation of scientists, but that it will also train current and future generations of researchers who are highly motivated and well-equipped to produce more diverse science.<br/><br/>The 1-year fellowship program will have three main components?a) rigorous hands-on research training, b) professional development, and c) community engagement. To gain hands-on research training, fellows will receive a stipend to work full-time in a Rutgers-Newark lab in the Psychology Department for the duration of the summer. To foster career professional development and enhance their research skills, fellows will also take part in a weekly, one-hour research seminar during the academic year. Finally, they will receive training in community engagement so that they can learn how to recruit a diverse and representative sample of human subjects for their own research, and how to disseminate their findings directly to those community members.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most of the uncertainty in future ice sheet contribution to sea level rise under particular emissions pathways comes from incompletely constrained ice sheet models. In practice, differences in calibration data and procedures between models lead to large uncertainties in sea level projections at 2100 and beyond. To make optimal use of the benefits of both modern and geological observations of ice sheet change, the proposed project will adapt state-of-the-art computational methods from applied mathematics and computer science to assimilate many different types of observations into ice sheet models. Ultimately, these methods will be used to produce gapless estimates of past glacier state over multimillennial time scales and improved projections of future ice sheet change. The educational component of this project will extend an existing standards-based curriculum on sea level rise through high school computer science courses. <br/><br/>The main focus of the research component of this project is the development of an open-source software package for applying transient ensemble Kalman filtering techniques to a wide range of ice sheet models, enabling the seamless integration of glaciological and geological observations with physical models. Two initial case studies will focus on reconstructing past glacier changes and using these reconstructions to initialize future predictions of change at Sermeq Kujalleq (aka Jakobshavn Isbrae) in Greenland and Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica. The final part of this project will add these data assimilation capabilities to a cloud-based ice sheet model with a browser-based interface so that it can be used to directly assimilate data from a community repository of ice sheet observations during simulations of past and future glacier behavior. The educational component will develop a new high school curriculum focused on data-based exploration of past and future sea level rise and its driving processes, in alignment with existing Georgia (and national) standards in Computer Science and Statistics courses.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Parasites are one of the most common threats to the health of organisms worldwide. The ability of hosts to prevent or control infection is therefore a critical factor for survival. Resistance to parasites depends upon the genes of the host, as well as other factors including the host?s diet and microbes present within the host?s gut. However, relatively little is known about how these factors interact to impact infection. Using genetic analyses and lab experiments, this project will look at how host genes, chemicals in the diet, and gut microbes interact to provide protection against parasites. This research will help to understand the causes of disease susceptibility, and will be important for agriculture, conservation, and human and wildlife health. Additionally, the fellow will mentor undergraduate students through hands-on research experiences and develop lessons on the connection between diet and disease for K?6 students.<br/><br/>This research will focus on monarch butterflies, which use toxic chemicals in their food plants as a medicinal defense against a debilitating protozoan parasite. As both the genotype of the monarch and the chemistry of its diet strongly influence this host-parasite relationship, this system is ideal for evaluating interactions between genetic and ecological sources of resistance. The specific research aims are: (1) determine the genetic basis of resistance by crossbreeding monarchs from resistant and susceptible populations and performing quantitative trait locus analysis; (2) experimentally evaluate the extent to which host genotype and dietary chemistry indirectly contribute to resistance by modulating the gut microbial community; (3) investigate the mechanistic basis of resistance by measuring the ability of parasites to penetrate the host?s gut barrier in the presence, or absence, of plant chemicals and gut microbes. This research will elucidate the direct and indirect (i.e., microbe-mediated) pathways through which host genes and diets contribute to disease resistance. Through this project, the fellow will receive training in cutting-edge techniques in quantitative genetics, chemical ecology, and microbiology. The fellow will also lead immersive undergraduate research experiences to support student preparation for scientific careers and collaborate with a local science center to implement interactive K?6 lessons that foster enthusiasm for ecological concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These boundary layers are composed of long-tailed lipid (fatty) molecules that assemble in a double layer (a bilayer) with different kinds of lipid molecules on the inner layer relative to the outer layer. This molecular difference, or asymmetry, is vital for cell function, and yet the fundamental reasons for this arrangement are not fully known. Professor Lee and her team will explore a large array of lipid compositions of cell membranes, using cell-size water droplets that self-arrange into asymmetric bilayers, and microscopically examine the resulting physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of these cell-mimics. The goal of the project is to determine how the differing shapes and sizes of individual lipid molecules can impact cell-membrane mechanical strength, leakiness, and stability, which determine the functions and the life cycle of living cells. The project has the potential to provide insights that aid in the design of soft matter systems and functional materials, and also contribute to better understanding of biologically relevant materials.  The scientific broader impacts of the proposed work relate to potential longer term implications of these studies for the production of biosensors, diagnostics, and drug screening platforms. This project will also employ research methods that will help train the next generation of globally-competitive scientists with hypothesis-driven interdisciplinary research, and is expected to include participation from members of underrepresented groups.  Outreach activities are planned to extend the public engagement with this research by involving middle/high school students and teachers at minority serving institutions.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Sunghee Lee and her group will impose increasing spontaneous curvature upon symmetric and asymmetric planar lipid bilayers and ascertain changes in the driving force for bilayer formation, to develop a direct experimental transducer for curvature elastic stress energy.

Hooley of the University of California?Riverside is developing new chemical structures that can mimic the behavior of large biomolecules such as enzymes. Enzymes can selectively perform many different chemical reactions in the biological systems, with reaction specificity being defined  by the disposition of functional groups about the ""active site? binding pocket. Artificial chemical catalysts have many uses in molecular synthesis, but a defined binding pocket is one aspect of biological catalysis that small molecules do not possess. In this research project, the Hooley team aims to develop self-assembly approaches to create new chemical structures that act in a manner similar to enzymes and to explore the potential applications of these structures in catalysis. In addition, by incorporating flexible motifs into the superstructure, the catalysis can, in principle, be controlled by external agents, allowing for the development of ?switchable? biomimetic catalysis. This project will provide interdisciplinary research training to graduate students and undergraduates in areas that bridge chemistry, biology, and materials science. <br/><br/>One approach to creating large, complex molecules in a rapid manner is self-assembly, whereby individual pieces are reversibly arranged to make superstructures that contains a spacious binding pocket which allows other molecules to enter. Self-assembled cage complexes have a wide array of applications, but their use as biomimetic catalysts is limited by the lack of activating groups in their ?active site? cavities. The Hooley research group seeks to remedy this by creating synthetic receptors via metal-ligand based self-assembly that display reactive functional groups to their cavity interiors. These functionalized receptors can then be used as enzyme-mimicking catalysts that promote a variety of complex, multi-step reactions. This project focuses on two broad sub-areas, based on the different strategies to incorporate reactive functions to the receptors: 1) Investigate broad-scope biomimetic catalysis with self-assembled cages containing rigidly positioned functional groups; 2) Investigate switchable molecular recognition and catalysis using cage hosts with flexible, rotating functions. In the first Area, new receptors will be synthesized that have a range of internal reactive groups and can function in different media for enhanced catalytic activity. They will be used in broad scope biomimetic catalysis, focusing on complex, multistep reactions. In the second Area, functionalized cages with spacious cavities and functional groups that can rotate freely about an axis will be targeted, and used for triggered reactivity controlled by external effectors, for selective molecular recognition, and for asymmetric catalysis. An important objective in this area is to ensure that the cage catalysts are stable to a variety of reaction conditions, and can be applied across a range of different environments, including in aqueous solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microbes can have many effects on animals, including everything from their digestion to their survival in extreme temperatures. For example, green frog tadpoles raised in water without microbes were more affected by high temperatures and had a higher chance of dying from heat stress than tadpoles grown in water containing wild pond microbes. This suggests that their microbiome ? the microbes living in and on tadpoles ? shapes the frog?s physiology and tolerance to extreme conditions. Green frogs live in ponds across the entire East Coast of the USA, from colder northern states to much warmer southern states.

Despite the threat of climate change, the effects of temperature on major ecological processes are still not well understood. Community assembly is a process in which biotic and abiotic factors interact, giving rise to the group of species that make up a community. This research aims to understand the link between temperature and community assembly. The project will combine experimental and theoretical methods. The model system consists of the native North American plant Pedicularis densiflora and its nectar microbes. Flowers and their nectar begin as a sterile environment. Over time, microorganisms arrive, transported by pollinators like insects and birds. The first goal of this project is to measure the temperature responses of nectar microbes. Then, community assembly in the laboratory and the field will be studied. The project will also develop new theory for the effects of temperature on community assembly. The temperature responses of life history traits are conserved among many life forms. Therefore, studies on nectar microbes can provide insights about the effects of climate change in other communities.<br/> <br/>Nectar microbe communities consist of a small set of bacteria and yeast species. They can be cultured, and their populations quantified in laboratory settings. This makes them an ideal system to disentangle the effects of climate change on community assembly. The project will first measure thermal reaction norms of growth rate. Growth rate will be quantified in terms of death and birth with the goal of building a parameterized model for each species. The second phase of this project involves studying the outcomes of assembly by building experimental communities in the lab and in the field subject to different temperature regimes. The experimental data will be used to calculate interaction strengths between species and build a theoretical model for community assembly that incorporates temperature. Finally, the consequences of different nectar communities on pollination preference and fecundity of P. densiflora will be studied. The fellow will gain expertise in bacterial methods, molecular techniques, and mathematical modeling.

López is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at University of California, Santa Barbara. López will apply new detector technology, MKIDs, to more conventional spectroscopic instrument architectures to develop a novel way to conduct multi-object high-resolution spectroscopy. The unique properties of these detectors can be used in modern spectrographs to discover and characterize exoplanets simultaneously, or take high-resolution spectra of star clusters without compromising spectral resolution. López will also work with the Center for Science and Engineering Partnership (CSEP) to develop and expand a new peer mentoring program specifically tailored toward community college transfer students.<br/><br/>Conventional high-resolution spectrographs are typically designed to take spectra of single targets or very limited fields of view. On the other hand, multi-object spectrographs generally need to make compromises between spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, the number of targets, and instrument cost. This project will use microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) to pave the way towards developing a new class of high-resolution multi-object spectrographs (HRMOS) without the need to compromise resolution or coverage. The inherent energy resolution of the MKIDs can eliminate the requirement of a cross-dispersing element in a high-resolution spectrograph, freeing up valuable detector space that can be allocated to the spectra of multiple objects. Building on this proposed project, a future fiber-fed MKID HRMOS will be able to sample a comprehensive region around a star to detect and characterize exoplanet atmospheres using the high-dispersion coronagraphy technique.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past research has demonstrated that the ocean spray effects on hurricane dynamics depend strongly on the size of spray droplets. Therefore, the PI will focus on developing a comprehensive mathematical framework and its numerical implementation to accurately model the polydisperse ocean spray effect on the vertical fluxes of momentum and heat in a hurricane boundary layer. This will aid in improving the accuracy of hurricane forecasts, which in turn will help minimize property damage and loss of human life. The research project will also allow North Carolina A&T State University, a state-supported HBCU, to sustain and expand recently established new research and educational capacity in applied mathematics and scientific computing with applications to atmospheric multiphase turbulent flows. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PI will expand the currently existing mathematical model of a hurricane boundary layer laden with ocean spray by accurately accounting for spray polydispersity. The developed model will be used to conduct a comprehensive parametric study of its effect on the dynamics of the marine atmospheric boundary layer in high-wind hurricane conditions. To fill the current gap in understanding spray polydispersity's influence the PI plans to employ a modern theory of turbulent disperse multiphase flows and the Eulerian multi-fluid approach. This approach considers groups of droplets of different sizes, air, and water vapor as separate interacting turbulent continua, each described by its own set of conservation laws and characterized by its own velocity, temperature, and turbulent kinetic energy distributions. The conservation laws for polydisperse spray will be presented in the form of population balance equations. In particular, the method will consistently account for droplet breaking/coalescence and evaporation/condensation dynamics.  Combining this method with a higher-order multi-fluid turbulence model will enable the PI to accurately predict the influence of polydisperse ocean spray on hurricane dynamics and structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are designed to help families with activities like meal planning, child development, and communication. However, their advanced sensing and reasoning capabilities can lead to privacy concerns, as they can collect, infer, and share personal information about their users. For instance, they can overhear private conversations as they move and act in the home. They also access sensitive environments, such as bedrooms, and can be designed to look like familiar objects or people, which can lead to people oversharing personal information. They might also inappropriately  disclose information they learned with other home occupants or visitors. Therefore, it is crucial to design more ?privacy-aware? social companion robots that can reason about when to collect and share data, and when not to, in ways that are context-appropriate and match people?s needs for privacy. This interdisciplinary project aims to create design principles for privacy-aware social robots to improve human-robot interactions in home environments. These principles will inform how robots are designed, used, and accepted in homes, workplaces, schools, and healthcare. Further, through outreach activities, the project will improve families? understanding of privacy in smart environments through media coverage, workshops, and office hours. The educational activities of the project will train K-12 and college students in privacy systems, family studies, and human-computer interaction. Finally, the project team will share code, publications, prototypes, and datasets based on the work.<br/><br/>This project develops, implements, and evaluates a novel privacy framework for human-robot interaction in four phases. This framework models users' privacy expectations, employs novel concepts grounded in human-robot interaction, develops new methods to help users manage their own privacy, and enables a study of privacy dynamics within families. Specifically, Phase I models users' privacy concerns and expectations regarding social robots, developing a privacy framework to identify everyday situations in which privacy awareness is most important. Phase II instantiates the framework as a privacy controller for the robot?s actions that captures the dynamics of social privacy. At the core of the privacy controller is a customizable architecture that generates privacy-aware actions based on extracted high-level contextual factors from the robot's environment, such as location in the house and number of people present. Phase III explores how the robot can leverage the privacy controller architecture to signal, demonstrate, or explain the robot's privacy-aware actions to users. Through deployment studies, phase IV assesses the impact of privacy awareness on the robot's management of the complex privacy trade-offs involved in participation in family life. The findings of these studies will provide an empirical basis for understanding a privacy-aware social robot's benefits, effects, and limitations on family dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For several optimization problems, it is possible to prove that (i) finding good approximate solutions is as hard as finding optimal solutions, and (ii) for specific parameters of interest, under plausible assumptions, the problem does not admit algorithms with fixed parameter tractability runtime. In fact, for many important problems, it is possible to prove that for specific parameters of interest, and under plausible assumptions, the problem does not even admit algorithms computing only an approximate solution while having fixed parameter tractability runtime. This project concerns the study of such inapproximability results. The research goals of the project will be integrated with teaching, mentoring, and dissemination activities.

The problems that are planned to be investigated in this project are essentially the same problems pursued in the 1990s in the non-deterministic polynomial (NP) world which then formed the bedrock of hardness of approximation results therein. In the NP world, these results (and the techniques developed) served as the starting point to prove the inapproximability of various other problems of interest to the Theoretical Computer Science community (such as Clustering, Travelling Salesman Problem, Scheduling problems, etc.).

The project introduces a set of novel and explainable machine learning approaches tailored to single-cell data analysis. A platform for explainable machine learning will be developed capable of supporting advanced analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data and making explainable predictions to directly link phenotypes with genes and pathways in specific cell types. The approaches from this project are translational to any tabular datasets with low-sample-size or many variables, which are prevalent in biological research. The project?s single-cell sequencing data analysis tools, results, and generated data will be excellent exemplars of research projects for exposing undergraduates, graduates, women, and minority students to the development and application of explainable machine learning approaches to advance our understanding of biology at the single cell level. Moreover, development and application of powerful machine leaning tools that yield interpretable results from complex biological datasets and broad accessibility to these methods, tools and results will maximize their value, accelerate biological discovery and advance our understanding of cellular and molecular biology. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project will develop a platform of novel machine learning approaches to generate disentangled representations of cells and genes in latent spaces for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which can be used to make explainable predictions of phenotypes. The project contains three synergistic tasks: (1) develop explainable cell-prototype-based approaches to single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, (2) develop explainable concept-based machine learning models for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, and (3) develop machine learning methods to generate representative single cell expression data from bulk RNA sequencing data. Through these tasks, the project develops algorithms, models and tools that enable the full power of state-of-the art explainable machine learning to be applied to single cell data analysis and phenotype prediction at single cell resolution. The algorithms and tools produced by this project will be broadly applicable to predicting genes and pathways at the single cell level in different organisms.

Modern wireless networks (such as 5G and 6G) have promised to enable such connectivity. However, these networks have faced two major problems which prevent them from becoming scalable and ubiquitous. First, they have limited coverage. Specifically, to enable high data-rate connectivity, these networks use very high-frequency signals for communications.  Unfortunately, these signals experience high path-loss, and also get easily blocked by obstacles, the human body, or walls. Therefore, these networks do not provide reliable high-data-rate links in remote areas, or environments with static or mobile obstacles. Second, their radios consume higher power than lower frequency radios (e.g. WiFi). Hence, devices with limited energy sources (such as sensors with small batteries) cannot benefit from these networks. This project tackles the above problems, enabling high data-rate, low-latency, and reliable wireless connectivity wherever and whenever is needed. Moreover, developing new wireless technology is strategically important for setting the US as the leader in 5G/6G and its applications. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature and will have a significant impact on different aspects of the society such as education, smart environment, health, agriculture, and emergency response.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to make millimeter Wave (mmWave) networks scalable and ubiquitous. To achieve this, it develops novel repeaters and surfaces which can extend coverage and reliability of mmWave networks. The design is low-cost and low-power while supporting multiple users and mobility.  The project also develops a new scheme enabling energy-constrained devices to harvest energy from mmWave networks, and use it to power up their mmWave radios. The research takes a holistic view, and innovates across all layers of the wireless stack. To this end, the researchers will design and build novel antennas and hardware that enables passive beamforming and steering, novel algorithms that enable low-power link establishment, and networking protocols which enable end-to-end systems. Finally, the system will be integrated into the Smart Home application, to demonstrate its superior capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chen of Colorado State University is developing new synthetic routes for the construction of technologically important cyclic polymers and copolymers from bio-based renewable monomers.  Cyclic polymers are an intriguing class of macromolecules that lack chain ends.  When compared to linear counterparts, these polymers typically have lower viscosity, faster crystallization kinetics, and sometimes higher resistance to chemical and thermal degradation. These properties make cyclic polymers ideally suited for a variety of industrially important applications.  The project will utilize synthetic, catalytic, and mechanistic approaches to prepare a variety of cyclic polymers and copolymers with the aim of precisely controlling the structures and sequences of monomer units.  Computational methods through established international collaborations will further guide experimental design. The synthetic work has the potential to help provide precision regular and block cyclic polymers at a scale large enough for structure/property relationship studies to be conducted by the broader polymer community.  From the point of view of sustainability, the design principles associated with this project have the potential to help nucleate a sea change, whereby recyclable and upcyclable polymers are more widely produced and used as commodity plastics.  The activities associated with this project are intended to broaden participation and enable the training of undergraduate and graduate students in polymer chemistry, with a distinct effort to develop and promote more sustainable approaches than are typically practiced today.<br/><br/>In this work, Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) will be used for tailored synthesis of cyclic polymers and copolymers.  LPP exploits the synergy and cooperativity between an acid and a base of a Lewis pair (LP) to effect monomer activation, chain initiation, propagation, termination, and transfer events.  This cooperative two-component catalytic mechanism provides several advantageous features when compared to other polymerization methods, particularly with respect to compounded sequence control and spatiotemporal control in one-step precision synthesis.  Cyclic polymers (CPs) have historically been less studied than their linear counterparts, which is mainly due to limited synthetic access to this interesting class of polymers. Specific objectives of the project include: (1) developing a better fundamental understanding of the factors that determine spatial and temporal control in the synthesis of precision CPs and cyclic block copolymers (cBCPs), (2) synthesizing higher-order multi-BCPs by LPP of bio-based acrylic monomers in one pot and one step, and (3) constructing stereoregular and recyclable CPs derived from renewable vinyl lactones utilizing chiral dinuclear LPs as promoters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Insects commonly form partnerships, known as symbioses, with bacteria. Within their insect hosts, bacterial symbionts can serve a variety of roles from synthesizing essential vitamins to increasing host resistance to heat stress. These bacterial partners can also alter the way insects respond to infection with other microbes?a phenomenon of particular interest for insects that transmit parasites that infect humans, animals, and plants (i.e., insect vectors). However, not all bacterial partners are equal and variation among individual insects as well as parasite strains can further complicate these interactions. This research addresses how variation among insect, bacterial symbiont, and parasite strain influences the outcome of infections in insect vectors. Its outcomes therefore also have implications for human health; the project will also help to address the underrepresentation of certain groups of undergraduates and postbaccalaureates in this important area of scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>The Fellow will carry out this research using kissing bugs?vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease?and their symbionts. The Fellow will first assess whether there is specificity in insect-symbiont pairings across kissing bug species and their Rhodococcus spp. symbionts by pairing all possible combinations of insect and bacteria in a full factorial design and assessing insect survival and fecundity as well as bacterial growth and persistence within the insect.

Systematic considerations of the uncertainty of long-term regional weather patterns due to climate change, maintenance resources, and new data sources can significantly improve the resilience of a resource-intensive transportation network maintenance. This project will lay the groundwork for transforming traditional static transportation network maintenance operations into the next-generation data-driven and dynamic program that will reduce transportation infrastructure maintenance time and costs and minimize adverse societal impacts.

Leveraging visible light and infrared spectrums, high-precision sensing and positioning, and high-speed mobile communication can be realized in a single system, enabling advanced solutions for future 6G scenarios, such as smart hospitals and industrial automation. The retro-reflective optical uplink is a promising emerging solution to ISAC-OW that offers several favorable features including hassle-free alignment, minimal interference to adjacent links, microwatt power consumption, low hardware complexity, glaring-free and sniff-proof, and enables simultaneous sensing, positioning and communication with a compact-size tag under a single luminaire.

Intervention studies indicate that activities conducted in the HME are critical to the development of early mathematics skills and can support children as they transition from informal to formal school settings, such as from preschool to kindergarten. Although many HME interventions have demonstrated significant and positive effects on children?s mathematics outcomes, researchers have overwhelmingly focused on typically developing children, often excluding students with disabilities. This is problematic because children with disabilities often enter school with lower mathematics skills compared to their typically developing peers and require supplemental support in mathematics. The purpose of this project is to develop a HME intervention for preschool-aged children with developmental delays (DD). The project includes caregivers of children with DD as collaborators in the iterative design process to develop feasible and sustainable HME intervention activities. <br/><br/>The two aims of the project are to: (1) iteratively develop a HME intervention targeting whole number concepts; and (2) conduct a small-scale pilot study of the HME intervention to establish the initial promise of the HME intervention in improving children?s mathematics achievement. To accomplish these goals the team will use an iterative design and development process, collect multiple sources of quantitative and qualitative data, and conduct a small pilot study with 80 caregiver-child dyads. Research questions will investigate the effect of the HME intervention on several outcomes: child numeracy and mathematics vocabulary, caregiver mathematics beliefs, caregiver-reported frequency of mathematics activities, caregiver-child mathematics talk, social validity, and fidelity of implementation. The project addresses the need for research-based HME interventions for young children with disabilities. The HME intervention is designed to be supplemental to and build upon the math instruction that children receive as part of their preschool curriculum.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigator and his research group develop fundamental principles of synthesis and apply them to the chemistry of metal chalcogenides, which are important in various scientific investigations and technologies. Thereby they pursue challenging new directions, discover and synthesize new materials. The project focuses on controlling reactions leading to solid state chalcogenides to avoid known materials and studying their crystal structure, physical properties, and potential technological impact. This research challenges and enhances scientific understanding in this field of chemistry and improves existing technological applications while impacting new ones. For example, the reseach leads to the discovery of new atomic arrangements and novel semiconductors, quantum materials, and ion-exchange sorbent materials for environmental remediation. The project also significantly impacts the training, problem-solving abilities, and pedagogy of graduate students specializing in solid-state and materials synthesis. It aids in developing a competent workforce that comprehends the role of novel materials as catalysts for cutting-edge science and technology. Moreover, the project presents a range of opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, particularly those from underrepresented communities, to acquire critical thinking skills that will advance scientific research in the future. <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, addresses the development of tools, concepts, and reaction paths, both intellectual and experimental, to prepare new materials rationally.  It is centered around fundamental science questions: (a) Can new semiconductors be designed by finding proper reaction paths? (b) Can insights from flux and non-flux reaction studies aid targeted synthesis? (c) Can distinct reaction paths be categorized for generalized synthetic methodologies? (d) Can chalcogenides' diverse motifs lead to enhanced properties? The research pursues new directions that have proven very challenging to date. For example, the pursuit of new phases by a) stuffing aristotype structures (in other words, to create new materials by inserting extra atoms in compounds possessing some of the most common structure types. Aristotype is a high-symmetry crystallographic structure type that can be viewed as an idealized version of a lower-symmetry structure), b) stabilizing novel tellurometallate building blocks in extended structures, c) developing synthesis of mixed anion compounds oxy-chalcogenides in a rational manner using a new kind of flux. These aspects represent the cutting edge of chalcogenide solid-state chemistry. They align with the principal investigator?s ongoing interest in novel physical properties of new compounds beyond mere structural characterizations. The benefits of a successful project are broad insights advancing the cutting edge of solid state and materials chemistry, the discovery of novel materials with attractive physical and chemical properties and potential applications, and new knowledge of reaction paths leading to new chalcogenides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end, exploring novel computational principles inspired by the brain may offer promising new avenues to enable artificial intelligence. This project is positioned to address key challenges in designing and engineering brain-inspired spiking neural models. As such, it may lead to methods, tools, and hardware system designs that will ultimately support new generations of software- and hardware-based artificial intelligence systems with potentially significantly improved performance and efficiency. This project will produce educational materials to be integrated into undergraduate- and graduate-level curricula on artificial intelligence and hardware system design, thereby providing workforce training opportunities in these areas of importance. The principal investigator will actively recruit undergraduate, underrepresented, and female students for research participation and training while partnering with various outreach programs. The results of this award may be derived in a variety of forms, including algorithms, software design tools, and hardware architectures and implementations that will be disseminated in broad research and industrial communities through publications, workshops, talks, and research collaborations. Engagement with US high-tech industries and other research organizations will be sought to broaden the impact of this work, promote potential technology transfer into practice, and offer additional mentoring and training of students under diverse industrial and research settings.<br/><br/>Deep learning based on conventional non-spiking artificial neural networks (ANNs) has achieved great success in many application domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the conventional ANNs cannot immediately explore temporal codes and lack energy-efficient event-based processing. On the other hand, it is believed that attaining near-human-level intelligence requires computing paradigms that better mimic biological brains. As such, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a complementary biologically-plausible approach to facilitating future artificial intelligence systems. However, there are key roadblocks to a wider adoption of spiking neural networks. SNNs are much harder to train than conventional ANNs. There is a general lack of insights and systemic approaches for designing computationally-powerful SNNs, particularly SNNs with recurrent connections. Hardware acceleration of SNNs is hampered by complex data dependencies across both time and space, and unstructured firing sparsity. This work will start out by developing much needed accurate SNN training methods that can robustly learn precise temporal behavior and jointly tune spike count and spike timing. Scalable architectural design of recurrent SNNs and novel automated spiking neural structural optimization methods will be developed to support the design of computationally powerful SNNs. To enable energy-efficient high-throughput hardware acceleration, dedicated SNN hardware accelerator architectures that minimize expensive data movements and facilitate parallel processing in both space and time will be designed. Application-independent spike coding, spike compression, and architectures exploring unstructured firing sparsity will be investigated for SNN hardware acceleration. High-performance SNN hardware accelerators will be demonstrated on field-programmable gate-array devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, it is critical to train the next generation of data scientists to develop methods and analyze data responsibly. This interdisciplinary project will provide undergraduate students with training in equitable data science to build their research skills in data science, statistical modeling and machine learning, and scientific communication. Through this training the students will learn how data sources, analysis methods, and the interpretation of results can reflect, reinforce, and mitigate systemic inequalities. The students will be trained to prioritize equity when approaching data-centered projects. These projects will lead to publicly-available software and reports that bring awareness to societal inequities and inform discussions on how to address them. Finally, the students will disseminate their work via a community event, which will inspire future research and connect the community with equity-related research. <br/><br/>Developing skills in equitable data science are invaluable towards enhancing scientific rigor while balancing fairness and equity in scientific research. During the 10-week program, students will build research skills in equitable data science and answer equity-oriented research questions about adolescent development using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Topics on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and their role in data science form the foundations of this program, emphasized early through DEI modules and discussions. Students will learn the causes and consequences of social inequality and how these inequalities manifest themselves in scientific research, from the data itself to the interpretation of results. The program continues with extensive technical training in R for programming, statistical modeling, and data visualization. Weekly workshops will provide technical training on topics ranging from statistics and machine learning to large-scale programming. Seminars and professional development events will be held every other week so that students will hear from researchers about their work on social and health inequities, prepare students for graduate school or the job market, and provide students with networking opportunities. Hackathons will also be held every other week so that students can gain experiences in equitable data science beyond the data from the ABCD Study.

Soft materials are those which exhibit behaviors having a significant dependence on temperature.  This includes liquid crystals used in display technology, gels and colloids used by industry in foods and consumer products, and constituents of biological systems.  Insights into behaviors and the design of soft materials with specified target properties poses significant challenges given subtleties in how interactions and rearrangements at the microscopic level can vary with temperature, density, and other physical conditions.  This calls for the further development of advanced computational methods for modeling, simulation, and optimization for soft materials.  This project contributes new data-driven techniques and software tools for soft materials by leveraging and further developing emerging machine learning methods and simulation approaches.  This includes adversarial training methods for learning representations of materials leveraging computational properties of competitive games coupled with further development of deep neural network architectures.  The approaches will be used to develop tools for modeling and designing soft materials with target properties and for improving the fidelity and efficiency of computational simulations. Open source software also will be developed and released for use by the community. Outreach activities are planned for promoting diversity and engaging under-represented students both at the University of California Santa Barbara and in the local community. This includes working with local area K-12 schools and colleges on programs to engage students on topics in computation, data science, machine learning, and engineering.

If a powerful quantum computer can be built it will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. While errors due to the delicate nature of typical quantum states have mitigated progress, topological quantum computation (TQC) is an approach that could overcome this issue. This is by utilizing materials in which information can be ""knotted,"" like a quantum quipu, making them naturally robust against the most common errors. After several years of the relevant research groups working separately, the time is right to bring together a diverse group of physicists and mathematicians with the goal of re-examining the field and exploring new platforms for topological quantum computation. This grant supports the participation of US-based researchers in a workshop to be held in the UK to achieve this goal, foster new collaborations between researchers in the US, the UK, and the rest of the world, and broaden the participation of junior researchers and members of groups historically under-represented in this area. This workshop will bring together researchers in a diversity of fields in and around TQC for the purpose of broadening and deepening the subject, with an eye towards accelerating the realization of scalable technology.<br/><br/>The hurdle of scalable fault-tolerance is insurmountable with the current incremental progress -- while it is possible to engineer systems supporting hundreds of physical qubits, applications beyond mere proof of principle require millions of qubits to implement robust error correction. Topological quantum computation relies upon the preparation of topological phases of matter supporting non-abelian anyons to perform inherently fault-tolerant operations. As errors are corrected at the hardware level through the topological nature of anyons, the problem of scalability is simultaneously overcome. On the other hand, despite years of effort we still do not have unassailable confirmation that non-abelian anyons exist. We will explore new directions beyond the traditional anyon community,  embracing relevant topics such as quantum cellular automata, fractons, categorical symmetries and motion groups in 3-dimensions.

To change their functional state, macrophages receive signals from their environment/extracellular matrix (ECM). One of the ways the ECM can direct macrophage function is through integrins. Integrins are receptors found on macrophage membranes, and their associated ligands (molecules that can bind to the receptors) are found throughout the ECM. The ECM integrin receptor-ligand pair can determine the macrophage functional state. Currently, there are limited strategies to understand the fundamental relationship between ECM ligands and macrophage integrin receptors. In this CAREER project, the investigator will combine ECM ligands with peptide polymer chemistry to design biomaterial tools for investigating the influence of ECM ligands on macrophage function. The proposed program will increase fundamental understanding of how ECM ligands inform macrophage function by introducing biomaterial tools to quantify ECM ligand influence. Education and outreach activities are integrated with the proposed research and involve introducing a biomaterials business project plan for undergraduate students, developing a workshop for biomaterial career exposure to historically excluded students, and extending biomaterial projects for middle school students.<br/><br/>Macrophage immune cells determine tissue homeostasis, wound healing, and tissue regeneration through signals from their microenvironment. The investigator?s long-term research goal is to understand how extracellular matrix (ECM) composition directs macrophage function.  In support of this goal, this CAREER project focuses on developing polyethylene glycol-based biomaterial tools with known peptide-derived ECM ligands to quantify integrin ligand-receptor influence on macrophage activation.  While it is understood how some cues direct macrophage function, as a field it is not understood how the extracellular matrix (ECM) directs macrophage function. Existing experimental systems designed to investigate macrophage function in the ECM are limited due to lack of control over incorporation of ECM ligands.  The tools developed in this project will overcome this limitation.  Studies are designed to test the central hypothesis that ECM-derived ligands from collagen, laminin, and fibronectin direct macrophage activation either towards a pro-inflammatory state or towards a pro-tissue healing state. Leveraging polymer chemistry and known ECM ligands, the proposed work comprises three research objectives: 1) quantifying integrin ligands influence on macrophage function via three-dimensional peptide screening, 2) designing combinatorial ECM ligand biomaterials to quantify ECM niche impact on macrophage function; and 3) quantifying the influence of age on human-donor macrophage function via combinatorial ECM ligand biomaterials. To successfully complete these aims, techniques established in the investigator?s lab will be employed for polymer-peptide conjugation, hydrogel formulation, mechanical assessments, and soluble stimulation of macrophages in a three-dimensional biomaterial. Molecular evaluations of macrophage function will include secretome analysis, immunocytochemistry, and interrogation of genetic expression alterations as a result of interaction with each ECM ligand. Completion of the tasks set forth will lay the foundation understanding how ECM ligands direct macrophage function through design of biomaterial tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this issue, non-orthogonal transmission has been proposed as a potential solution. By sharing spectrum among multiple users, more devices can access the spectrum or more bandwidth can be committed to each transceiver, achieving higher data transmission rates. However, non-orthogonal transmission suffers from interference among users, and effective transmission and decoding methods are needed for its successful deployment.  The primary goal of this research is to develop such methods and advance the field, which has significant value for next-generation wireless networks and applications like the Internet of Things (IoT). In addition, the project will provide education opportunities, including involving undergraduate students in research on deep learning for communications and designing graduate-level course material.

A particular focus of this research is on designing new superimposed constellations for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) that take into account both noise and interference during the design phase. Unlike traditional constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation, the proposed transform results in non-uniform constellations that can adapt to different interference levels and work effectively in their presence.

This award is supporting research to improve the data analysis methods in order to increase the number of gravitational-wave signals that can be identified in the data, by using machine learning techniques to make use of measures of data quality, to enable even better studies of astrophysics and fundamental physics using gravitational waves.  This award also supports real-time data analysis operations and rapid checks so that reliable candidate events can quickly be communicated to astronomers, to enable rapid follow-up observations leading to the next multi-messenger breakthroughs.  The award supports the training of a graduate-student scientist and outreach activities to share LIGO science results and general science concepts with the public.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award will advance the science program of NSF's LIGO and the project's international partners in two main areas: improving the detection of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events in the upcoming O4 observing run, and ensuring readiness to detect and study the next great multi-messenger event ? or the next few, as nature provides.  The PyCBC data analysis pipeline will be improved by incorporating data quality information into the detection statistic using machine learning methods, an approach which has been demonstrated (in preliminary studies) to improve the net sensitivity of searches.  The upgraded PyCBC pipeline will be used both for low-latency searches and for the final production analysis feeding into the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) transient event catalog, furthering LVK collaboration goals while developing the scientific skills and experience of a graduate student researcher.  This award will also support the validation and monitoring of other data analysis pipelines, and tools and procedures to coordinate rapid response activities by LVK scientists when a promising candidate has been found.  This award also will support the maintenance of collaboration tools to plan, track, publish and disseminate the LVK?s science results from the O4 observing run.  Finally, it will provide some funds for supplies for the University of Maryland Physics Department?s STEM education/outreach programming for young students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, random morphologies and poorly controlled porosity of paper-based materials have significantly prevented tailoring biomolecular transport and catalytic phenomena. Current bio-derived and synthetic materials possess random porous morphologies with wide distributions of functionalities and porosities that compromise their effective molecular transport and biocatalytic activity, especially in relationship to enantiotropic biological compounds. Therefore, deeper understanding of potentially strong and flexible membranes with long-range ordered low-dimensional structural elements is required to advance the fundamental knowledge of novel nanoporous bio-derived materials with inclusion of novel open pore organized materials with controlled and responsive channel organization.  For this purpose, we suggest using peptide segments with well-defined ability for selective interactions including chiral-related transport and magnetic clusters/atoms for coordination of open unit cells with molecular pore dimensions.  Moreover, external magnetic field can be explored to create larger-scale responsive materials with transport properties directed by its direction and strength. Experimental research will be guided and assisted by machine learning and computational approaches.  Finally, the research project will provide interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds in experimental and computational biomaterials science for advanced material and biomolecular industry.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>This proposal will consider novel classes of organized nanochannel biomolecular nanomaterials for understanding the design principles of efficient organized gel-like adaptive materials with enhanced porosity dimension and topological control, materials and energy transport, chiral biomolecules selection and storage/release, and prospective chiral biocatalytic templates. Numerous critical issues must be addressed in order to establish principles of assembly of low-defect bio-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) such as problems with limited unit sizes and pores due to the very short peptide sequences, small pore sizes, limited symmetries achievable, and high concentration of defects for directional and responsive loading, transport or potential for enantiotropic selection and biocatalytical abilities. The major novel units that the team will synthesize, design, and study are biomolecular magnetic organic frameworks (BiMOFs) based upon biologically encoded peptides with metal-binding terminal groups for coordination with magnetic ions/clusters. The key fundamental question to be addressed is how the guided co-assembly of functional biomolecular elements can be introduced as a tool for directed construction of large-scale organized hierarchical materials with stable and precisely controlled morphology of pore dimensions, channel topology, continuity, and chirality, and adaptive ionic and mass/energy transport properties. <br/>Design of biologically encoded magnetic bio-framework unit cells and biomolecular crystals of different symmetries and dimensions will be explored via site-specific metal-peptide coordination with tailored unit cell parameters, pore dimensions, channel dimensionalities, magnetic moment configuration, pores and microcrystal stability, and restructuring abilities of large-sized pores with biomolecular selectivity and chirality. The experimental work will be guided by theory, machine learning, and large-scale molecular simulations to understand the underlying scientific principles. The proposed research will leverage multi-scale modeling and machine learning powered by experimental verification to develop ?technology-specific? rules for the design and assembly of robust but adaptive nanochannel BiMOF architectures with inherent ability to reconfigure.  The work can enhance fundamental understanding of complex trasport phenomena in organized multi-phase nanomaterials with long-range organized assembly of nanocrystals and nanosheets. Finally, the PI?s mini-workshops Homecoming Series: Life and Career will be used to facilitate student readiness by interacting with former students and post-docs invited to visit their alma mater who enjoy successful careers in industry, national labs, and academia.

Unfortunately, tissue engineering cannot do this yet due to the complexity of growing human tissues. This project supports fundamental research into designing and predicting the mechanical stiffness of engineered tissues. This will make it easier to build tissues which are mechanically strong enough to use in the body. The work has the potential to benefit society by improving human health and broadens participation in scientific research by involving diverse undergraduate students from in research experiments and sharing their experience with peers.<br/><br/>Better predictive modeling and rational design of engineered biomaterials would help advance the field of tissue engineering.

This project will fill in a gap in knowledge around the critical biomechanical transition zone between single cells and multicellular aggregates that approach the tissue level and provide insights for theoretical modeling of multicellular biomechanical systems. The research team will use microfluidics to systematically measure the viscoelastic mechanical properties of cell spheroids ranging in size from single cells (10 micrometers in diameter) up to mesoscale multicellular spheroids (1 mm) and create a finite element model that captures the observed spheroid biomechanics in flow conditions.

In these tiny crystals, highly mobile electrons move under the influence of light, harnessing energy and concentrating otherwise diffuse infrared light into local regions the size of individual molecules. However, the very small size of the crystals means that their surfaces have a big impact on their mobile electrons and their interaction with light. Professor Milliron and her students are using chemical reactions to change the properties of the nanocrystal surfaces to understand and control the influence of surface chemistry. Their discoveries could lead to improved optoelectronic devices, like solar cells and displays, and to more sensitive chemical sensors to detect toxins or biochemical indicators of disease. The team is using virtual outreach strategies, especially targeting younger audiences, to broaden public awareness of science and to make science more accessible.<br/><br/>This project involves the post-synthetic surface chemical modification of doped metal oxide nanocrystals. Aliovalent dopants are incorporated in the nanocrystals during colloidal synthesis, introducing a high concentration of free electrons and leading to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the infrared spectral region. Their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption spectra and the near-field enhancement of electromagnetic field intensity are strongly influenced by the presence of surface electronic states that induce band bending. This project employs post-synthetic surface chemical reactions to modify the electronic structure of the nanocrystal surfaces. Dipolar organic molecules are attached to the surface to shift the energy levels and modify the depletion layer. During overgrowth of insulating metal oxide shells by colloidal atomic layer deposition, reactions with the chemical groups responsible for band banding shift the energy levels of the associated surface states. Optical analysis will be combined with photoemission spectroscopy to analyze the mechanisms by which surface chemistry influences LSPR, with the aim of establishing the foundational understanding needed to develop sensitive and chemically specific detectors, and to direct the flow of energy to tune and enhance catalytic processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inspired by the striking similarities between complex physical systems and complex engineering systems, we will consider primitive technologies as fundamental building blocks that form components, subsystems, systems, and eventually, systems of systems, which is analogous to the hierarchical physical world, where particles form atoms, which in turn form molecules, cells, organisms, planets, and galaxies. This research will establish a rigorous mathematical foundation that enables: (a) systematic investigation of the statistical pattern of technology emergence in the time dimension during and after a given technical project; and (b) dynamic system representation and re-evaluation to interpret potential system behaviors with the existing technology pool. This research establishes a new understanding of the fundamental dynamics of system evolution during the design process and provides a bottom-up perspective to handle unreliable system model representations and unexpected design outcomes for complex engineering systems. We will test the framework using the Apollo and Artemis programs as two applications at extreme scales to investigate technology evolution and the spillover effect during and after each project. This research will generate new knowledge that can enhance our understanding of the underlying causes of cost and schedule overruns at both the technology and system levels. Such insights can inform decision-making processes for future space missions and complex engineering programs in various industries. This project will also strive to engage broader interest in engineering design and space exploration among K-12 students and the public through outreach and diversity initiatives.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to create a novel system representation framework by connecting complex engineering systems with recent breakthroughs in understanding complex physical systems. We will model the engineering design process as the Renormalization Group (RG) transformation, a ubiquitous technique in modern statistic physics that models the behaviors of a system depending on the scale of which it is observed. The research approach is to (R1) understand the technology recursion process in the time dimension; and (R2) create a renormalization scheme in the hierarchy dimension to support dynamic system representation based on the macroscopic design features we are interested in. This research will lead to a new bottom-up approach to resolve epistemic uncertainties during complex engineering system design driven by the lack of knowledge of the correct way to model the system, future design decisions, and technology development outcomes. The research will have broad societal impact by incorporating the rigorous mathematical structure of technology recursion and system dynamics into complex system design to benefit a wide range of industries suffering from high development costs and project schedule overruns (e.g., public infrastructure, healthcare, defense, and aerospace).

Autonomous soaring aircraft offer new fuel-efficient approaches for travel, reconnaissance, and observation, including in hard-to-reach areas of the atmosphere. Their built-in simulators make assumptions about the presence of atmospheric boundary layers and updrafts to optimally extract energy from the prevailing winds. Computational models are also integrated in the planning and control architecture of unmanned aerial vehicles as they predict optimal paths through urban infrastructure based on estimates of the surrounding flow fields. Without assessing the uncertainty in their predictions, such simulators may result in suboptimal or catastrophic decisions, as opportunities for optimal performance are missed or safety constraints are violated. This project addresses this challenge by developing new, fast, and automated algorithms for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and updating computational models accordingly, and by validating these algorithms using experimental aircraft in controlled but complex wind conditions. The research is integrated with educational efforts aiming to bring a computational perspective on modeling, data science, and statistics to engineering students and the public through a series of workshops built around relevant case studies, a new data science class for an aerospace engineering curriculum, and a partnership with the Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum to develop exhibits accessible to K-8 students and their parents.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop the foundations of automated approaches for deriving problem-specific multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification techniques.

To overcome this limitation, the research will derive new statistical estimators through analysis of Bayesian posteriors and maximum entropy distributions endowed with only the information available rather than heuristics; use these estimators to develop new filtering, state estimation, and Bayesian inference techniques; and demonstrate how these techniques may be applied to challenging nonlinear, chaotic, and non-Gaussian dynamical systems arising in the context of planning and control of soaring aircraft in complex wind fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ever-growing amount of data has created a pressing need for new methodologies to reduce storage demands and extract representative features for downstream analysis. Many data, such as those arising in computer vision and imaging, neuroscience, networks (e.g., epidemic tracking, cyber security), and more, are natively represented as multiway arrays, or tensors. As a result, tensor-based approaches have become increasingly attractive for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. However, many tensor-based approaches suffer from a so-called ?curse of multidimensionality;? that is, that fundamental mathematical properties break down when applied to multiway data. Recent advances in tensor algebra have overcome this limitation by reframing tensors as mathematical operators rather than stagnant arrays of data. This project will take these advancements to the next level by learning the optimal mathematical operations required to drive down storage costs further while increasing the accuracy of tensor representations. The methods developed in this project will be useful for a wide range of high-impact applications, including precision medicine, climate simulations, and engineering. All algorithms and methods produced will be made available to the public in well-documented, open-source code. <br/><br/>This project focuses on developing new methods to maximize the benefits of matrix-mimetic tensor frameworks- multidimensional frameworks that preserve linear algebraic properties. Such frameworks yield theoretical and empirical advantages over traditional matrix-based approaches and alternative tensor-based approaches. The matrix mimeticity arises from interpreting tensors as t-linear operators that multiply using tensor-tensor products. The choice of tensor-tensor product, given by an underlying tensor algebra, is crucial to representation quality, and thus far, has been made heuristically. This project will develop a unifying optimization framework to learn tensor algebras and efficiently represent multiway data with implicit correlations (i.e., relationships unknown a priori and thus challenging to capture heuristically). The learned tensor-tensor products will introduce algorithmic advantages (e.g., fast evaluations and low storage costs) while preserving theoretical guarantees of the matrix-mimetic framework. The main thrusts of this project are (1) to optimize tensor algebras by exploiting the coupling between matrix-mimetic tensor factorizations and tensor-tensor products, (2) to capture nonlinearity in multilinear algorithms by designing novel nonlinear tensor-tensor products, and (3) to extend the proposed algorithms using new, scalable strategies to increase the applicability of matrix-mimetic tensor approaches to massive multiway data applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students? beliefs, along with their learning-related and socially influenced needs, perceptions, goals, and strategies, often described as psychosocial factors, are key factors to their academic achievement. Because such factors are malleable, many interventions targeting psychosocial factors have been evaluated and could be implemented in college math classrooms. However, questions remain about how effective these interventions might be and how the effects of such interventions may vary. This project will address the national priority to strengthen college students? mathematics attainment by investigating the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions. The project will collect and assess the accumulated evidence on psychosocial interventions in college mathematics. The findings from the project will help to improve mathematics outcomes for students in college, providing administrators and instructors with evidence-informed practices that can harness students? psychosocial qualities. <br/><br/>The project is a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of a large body of studies that test interventions targeting psychosocial mechanisms to improve postsecondary students? mathematics attainment. The project aims to examine published and unpublished studies that investigated the effects of psychosocial interventions on mathematics attainment through randomized controlled trials or high-quality quasi-experimental designs. Drawing from the Model of Strategic Learning and related literature, interventions will be categorized, and intervention effects aggregated, according to the psychosocial mechanism(s) being targeted. Using a frequentist approach, the project will answer two primary research questions: What is the overall effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in college mathematics on students? mathematics attainment and psychosocial factors? What are other sources of heterogeneity among intervention effects? This quantitative synthesis will create a rich database of studies and their effects, providing evidence about when, and to what degree, interventions alter students? psychosocial qualities and impact students? math outcomes. A systematic analysis will be conducted using the MUTOS framework which categorizes studies based on methods (M), units (U), treatments (T), outcomes (O), and settings (S). These categories will serve as testable moderators within random effects meta-regression models, assessing if the magnitude or direction of intervention effects vary by these characteristics. Exploring heterogeneity in treatment effects will generate insights regarding the components of successful psychosocial interventions, extend knowledge of psychological theories, and inform the design of evidence-based programs in college mathematics. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF?s EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

These materials exhibit many desirable properties that have been utilized in applications like composites, piping, bio-devices, flexible electronics, and impact mitigation. However, their use is limited in applications that require good fatigue and/or impact performance due to chemical and/or physical degradation, commonly referred to as aging. This is a significant concern when exposed to extreme environments of mechanical stress, heat, humidity, ultra-violet, and gamma radiation. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award supports research that aims to address these challenges by comprehensively examining the endurance of biocompatible elastomers. In medical applications, elastomers are used in heart devices which endure extreme conditions of dynamic loading, body temperature, body fluids, and oxygen. Natural aging during their intended use can result in fatal consequences for patients, thus it is crucial to understand the endurance of biocompatible elastomers to prevent in-service failure. This project will promote STEM education by collaborating with the Dearborn Toy Library in organizing activities for K-12 students. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to find a correlation between the mechanical and dynamic properties resulting from in-service aging and from accelerated aging conditions for environmentally aged biocompatible elastomers. Through extensive experimental and numerical investigations, this project will uncover how aging mechanisms affect the dynamic properties of biocompatible elastomers. A thermodynamics-based model and time-temperature equivalence principle will be developed based on the mechanical behavior of thermal- and humidity-aged biocompatible elastomers under various loading conditions and accelerated thermal aging conditions. Specifically, this proposal will address: (1) the effect of thermal aging on the static, viscous, and fatigue behavior of elastomers, (2) the effect of aging on the fatigue induced crazing and cracking initiation, propagation, and coalescence, and (3) the impact of aging on chain reptation mechanism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In 2023, over 600,000 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the USA. One of the primary factors behind the high death rate for cancer patients is the late diagnosis of cancer, since most cancers do not present early symptoms. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop fast and effective targeted therapies for treating cancer patients. For this purpose, biomedical imaging is a crucial component for establishing clinical protocols in cancer by helping obtain important anatomical, structural, and functional information of cancer formation and spread. In particular hybrid imaging methods, which use physics of coupled waves, provide quantitative information of cancerous tissues to guide better diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. One such hybrid imaging method is quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT) that uses short-pulse near infrared light and ultrasound propagation data to reconstruct high-fidelity optical properties, like light absorption and scattering profiles, in cancerous tissues. However, several practical challenges, like lack of adequate datasets and uncertainty of sound speed in tissues, limit the quality of reconstructions with existing computational methods in quantitative photoacoustic tomography. This project brings together a novel combination of theoretical and computational methods in mathematical game theory and statistical sensitivity analysis to tackle the aforementioned challenges and provide high quality reconstructions in QPAT. As a result, it will help facilitate accurate targeted imaging of cancerous tissues and improve clinical outcomes, thereby contributing to one of the strategic goals of USA Heath and Human Services to ?Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes?. Furthermore, this project will provide a unique interdisciplinary research and training experience for undergraduate and graduate students, especially from underrepresented groups, and will facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians, statisticians, and radiologists in the field of biomedical imaging.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to build a new class of accurate, fast, stable and robust non-linear reconstruction schemes for solving limited data hybrid imaging problems arising in QPAT. For achieving this goal, the specific research objectives are to (1) develop a new gradient-free Nash games computational scheme for data completion and identification of unknown sound speed and optical energy density in photoacoustic tomography; (2) build a new gradient-free optimization scheme for reconstruction of optical parameters with high contrast and resolution; and (3) use statistical sensitivity analysis to stabilize and calibrate the Nash algorithm for obtaining a stable reconstruction method in QPAT. The computational framework will be validated using real-time photoacoustic data of mice specimens. The project also aims at providing a new paradigm in computational methods for limited data inverse problems that yields computationally inexpensive, stable and superior reconstructions in comparison to existing computational frameworks, and thus will be beneficial for effective detection of cancers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Organismal development results from the actions of expressed genes and cellular processes. Changes in these traits can alter development, and therefore, the size and shape of an organism. Because of this, polyploidization can be a key factor in the evolution of development. An organism becomes a polyploid by having more than two sets of chromosomes. These additional chromosomes have direct effects on cell biology. First, polyploidy can alter gene expression by increasing the number of gene copies. Additionally, cells become larger as a result of the extra DNA content. Yet, how these polyploidy-related changes affect development remains largely mysterious. However, these effects do appear to be responsible for the rarity of polyploid animals. Most animals fail to develop early on as polyploids, suggesting development is sensitive to this condition. By studying polyploid animals, the Fellow aims to uncover the circumstances that make polyploidy possible in some lineages of animals but not others.  To achieve this, the Fellow will characterize development in polyploid salamanders. This fellowship will also support undergraduate research and educational outreach.<br/><br/>The research aims to investigate the consequences of polyploidy on the evolution of development and morphology in a hybrid lineage of polyploid salamanders (genus Ambystoma). The Fellow will assess how increased cell size due to polyploidy acts as a determinant of morphology across organ systems using CT scan data and histology. Second, the Fellow will investigate how ploidy-related changes in cell size and gene expression alter morphogenesis to characterize developing tissue morphology, pattern formation, and developmental cellular processes using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Finally, the Fellow will characterize how the additional copies of a genome gained through polyploidization affect developmental gene expression using ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq to test for differential regulation and expression of developmental genes throughout development. By studying these unique polyploid salamanders, the Fellow aims to understand how polyploidy shapes development and morphology. Addressing these knowledge gaps will broaden the fields? understanding of the role polyploidization has had in the evolution of phenotypic traits across the tree of life. In addition, the Fellow will facilitate and mentor research opportunities and develop workshops for undergraduates with limited research opportunities.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Charity Goeckeritz is ?A Comparative Genomics Approach to Understand the Genetic Regulation of Apomixis in Rosaceae?. The host institution for the fellowship is the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Alex Harkess.<br/><br/>Seeds usually contain a mixture of both parents? DNA due to a process called ?meiosis.? Plant breeders take advantage of meiosis to create new plant varieties, but sometimes a prized selection must be maintained and widely distributed, requiring extensive time and resources. Apomixis is a natural deviation of plant reproduction occurring most often in the rose, daisy, and grass families that results in clonal seed of the mother plant. Therefore, it provides a means of preserving elite plant varieties; it also increases the probability of fruit set. Still, the genetic basis of apomixis remains elusive, earning it the moniker ?the Holy Grail of plant breeding.? The study of apomixis has been reserved for fast-growing plants, which largely excludes plants in the rose family (Rosaceae) like apples and blackberries. However, with access to recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, the study of apomixis in Rosaceae is within reach. Comparing genomes of species with and without the capacity for apomixis will help identify the DNA sequences controlling this phenomenon. With respect to broader impacts, apart from its plant breeding significance, this work provides an opportunity to communicate the significance of natural plant diversity with relatable species to the general public. Moreover, state-of-the-art scientific techniques for this project will be taught to future scientists, focusing on students at historically black colleges and universities.  Training objectives include obtaining expertise in cutting-edge functional genomics tools and computational methods.<br/><br/>Apomixis, or asexual seed production, is a convergent trait frequently exhibited by the Poaceae, Asteraceae, and Rosaceae families. It has captivated researchers for decades because it can increase reproductive fitness and maintain elite crop genetics. Thus, apomixis has broad implications for species adaptation and crop improvement. This project focuses on the genetics of apomixis in Rosaceae, an area historically understudied due to long generational times. Comparative genomics will be used to identify the DNA sequences associated with apomixis with respect to their evolutionary trajectory. First, phased genomes will be produced for Malus and Rubus species differing in their mode of reproduction. Second, subgenomes and/or entire haplomes will be grouped using k-mer clustering and phylogenetically assessed. This will guide genomic comparisons by revealing any convergent inheritance patterns of apomixis. Lastly, differences between the two reproductive pathways will be explored through single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing. Project deliverables include genomic resources for crop relatives and information crucial for designing apomictic breeding strategies in the Rosaceae. Data for the project will be available in the Genomic Database for Rosaceae (www.rosaceae.org), the National Center for Biotechnology Information?s GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), and the United States?

Imaging devices have fundamental resolution limits, and super-resolution techniques are computational methods that are used to bypass such limits by leveraging prior information about an imaged object. For many applications including remote sensing, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and quantum information theory, the imaged objects can be modeled as a collection of point sources and the collected information is a superposition of sinusoidal waves. This project develops novel super-resolution algorithms that will be used for imaging and signal processing and provides their performance guarantees. The City College of New York is one of the most diverse universities in the United States, and this project will support students through research opportunities.<br/><br/>Existing super-resolution theory and computational methods primarily pertain to the one-dimensional uniform sampling case. On the other hand many applications are inherently multidimensional and collecting samples may be expensive while new imaging technology allows for the acquisition of specialized information.

Despite the importance of DMS in climate on earth, a comprehensive understanding of the intermediate products in the oxidation of DMS is limited, leading to large variability in estimates of sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) yields; the key endpoints of DMS oxidation. This project will investigate the heterogeneous kinetics of key intermediates in the oxidation of DMS and how they regulate the production of sulfuric acid and MSA. This project will support the PhD thesis for one chemistry graduate student and multiple undergraduate thesis projects. The research team will continue to be involved the UW Madison chemistry recruitment program (CHOPS, CHemistry OPportunitieS) and the Bridge to the Chemistry Doctorate program designed to support underrepresented students in chemistry. Additionally, the research team will partner with local K-12 schools on the measurement and assessment of indoor air quality in public schools.<br/><br/>This project will use laboratory measurements to: 1) quantify the rate of heterogeneous and multiphase reactions of key intermediates in the OH-oxidation of DMS and 2) determine the product yields and chemical mechanism for the condensed phase reaction of hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF) in aerosol and cloud water. Specifically, using an entrained aerosol flow reactor coupled to a chemical ionization mass spectrometer, the team will determine the reactive uptake coefficient of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanesulfinic acid (MSIA), MSA and HPMTF to representative marine aerosol mimics (e.g., sea spray, ammonium sulfate) as a function of relative humidity and particle acidity. Using a combination of online and offline sampling techniques, the product yields for the condensed phase reactions of HPMTF in cloud water and marine aerosol mimics will be determined. This is expected to permit a more accurate assessment of the fraction of DMS emitted that forms sulfate aerosol.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge cannot be solved through research solely focused on technical solutions, but requires a critical interrogation of underlying assumptions about knowledge, education, and social change. The Global Futures Oriented Research Collective on Education for Sustainability (G-FORCES) aims to bring together international sustainability-oriented research networks from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to rearticulate the role of education for planetary sustainability in formal and non-formal lifelong learning settings. G-FORCES aims not merely to improve, but to fundamentally reshape the relationship between education and sustainability research across global networks in ways that effectively integrate different knowledge ecosystems, bridge the research-practice divide, and prioritize education for planetary wellbeing and ecological justice. <br/><br/>G-FORCES is a dynamic, multi-team collaboration across representatives from 10 diverse, globally leading research networks that share a common commitment to mobilize the power of education for planetary sustainability. Leveraging design approaches that enable structured but robust collaboration across networks, G-FORCES establishes a shared vision and strategic operational links across established research communities to engage in transdisciplinary convergence research that advances a comprehensive vision of sustainability education and climate literacy ? encompassing scientific, energy, media, and ecological literacy ? under a unified framework. Furthermore, it aims to maximize the impact of research on education policy and practice, create enduring local-to-global networks of scholarship and action, and address institutional barriers and structural limitations that presently limit integrated interdisciplinary climate research by creating new opportunities for inclusive research leadership for early-career scholars and from historically marginalized populations, particularly from the global South. Starting with a mapping exercise to identify gaps, connections, and synergies between networks, project activities will include annual research assemblies to set agendas for potential convergence research; a series of virtual co-design workshops to develop operational mechanisms for collaboration; and ongoing knowledge mobilization activities to engage relevant stakeholders to promote the transformation of  educational systems for planetary sustainability. In addition to generating innovative research synergies and creating new spaces for sharing knowledge across different research networks, G-FORCES  enhances connectivity among the world's leading scholars and education practitioners in enacting change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Chandler Meyer is ?Methods for Virus-based Plant Genome Editing? The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Minnesota and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Voytas.<br/><br/>Precision editing of plant genomes has the potential to accelerate crop improvement and advance functional genomics. Considerable progress has been made in this area, however, the most commonly used methods for gene editing in plants often require the use of tissue culture. The drawback of tissue culture is that it requires technical expertise, it is time intensive, and success is limited to a few genotypes. This project aims to develop a viral-based method of genome editing in plants that offers the potential to significantly reduce the need for tissue culture. If successful, the methods developed could be applied to crop species and greatly accelerate the ease of gene editing in crop plants, improving the ability of breeders to create new traits. The results from this work could also have a broad impact on plant biology by streamlining methods for generating mutants for gene function studies. Training objectives include outreach activities to promote community engagement in plant gene editing and plant science, mentoring undergraduate students, and dissemination of plant gene editing techniques by participation in the NSF-funded Plant Genetic Engineering Network (PlantGENE). <br/><br/>The most commonly used methods to deliver gene editing reagents to plant cells are Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and biolistic bombardment. To recover a gene-editing plant, tissue culture techniques are needed to regenerate a plant from the edited somatic cells. This is challenging for a few reasons. First, it often requires months of training and development of technical expertise. Second, successful regeneration is often limited to a few genotypes. Lastly, the tissue culture process can result in somaclonal variation. The use of viruses for genome modification in plants offers the potential to ease the tissue culture and reagent delivery bottlenecks. The research objectives of this project are to (1) improve the cargo capacity of TRV-based vectors so that TRV can deliver CRISPR-Cas nucleases to meristematic cells, (2) test the use of miniature CRISPR-Cas nucleases to overcome TRV-based vector cargo capacity limitations, and (3) identify RNA sequences that increase cell-to-cell mobility of sgRNAs and nucleases to promote delivery to the germline. This research will generate knowledge of methods for genomic modification of plants that can be used by plant breeders and researchers to develop novel traits and study gene function. Data generated will be released to the community through submission to public repositories, project web pages, and publications as well as presentations at scientific conferences, seminars, and workshops.

They model many types of behavior, from animal neurons to epidemics to weather modeling.  In some cases, we have a classification of the simplest types, and know how they are arranged.  For example, we have now a good understanding in the real quadratic case. This achievement was the result of work by many researchers from different fields. It remains a central challenge to give a classification of examples beyond the real quadratic setting.  This project takes up this challenge using tools from several different areas of mathematics.  It focuses on systems that involve complex numbers, and on more general types called conformal.  The conformal dynamical systems studied in this project include newly discovered, more exotic examples.  Though our understanding of those more general systems is poorer, we have many new tools, from algebra to analysis, with which to study them.  The project applies techniques from the well-developed theory of mapping class groups to the classification problem.  Mapping class groups are symmetries of two-dimensional objects and are studied by both mathematicians and physicists. This project generalizes the notion of a mapping class group in a way that includes these two-dimensional complex dynamical systems.  It also applies new tools from the recently developed theory of self-similar groups. This research area has an abundance of accessible problems.  Students who engage with these topics will come to appreciate the essential unity of mathematics and the excitement of research. This will contribute to the development of a pool of mathematical talent that is broadly trained.  Special software designed for this study allows for rich experimentation and the development of technical skills.   <br/><br/>The combinatorial foundations of complex dynamical systems were laid by A. Douady, J. Hubbard, and W. Thurston. The lack of a sufficiently natural algebraic framework delayed progress on fundamental problems until new techniques were introduced by L. Bartholdi and V. Nekrashevych in 2006. These selfsimilar group techniques are now standard. The recent developments in this new field are paralleling those in the theory of mapping class groups. The natural objects?branched self-covers of the sphere whose forward orbits of branch points form a finite set?may be fruitfully regarded as representing branched mapping classes in a countable semigroup. That this semigroup is in addition a biset over the pure mapping class group makes the combinatorial structure immensely rich. Just as with mapping class groups, on the semigroup side, there are similarly very deep connections to Teichmueller theory, dynamics, geometry, and algorithmic questions. The fuller exploration of these connections is the focus of this project. Basic dynamical finiteness results, and the development of an appropriate notion of relative hyperbolicity, are currently lacking. Intriguingly, the notions of relative hyperbolicity seem to lead naturally to connections with both coarse geometry and arithmetic dynamics on Berkovich spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal of this project is to advance the understanding of reconstructing hidden properties from measurable data. This project specifically aims to investigate fundamental questions and devise reconstruction methods to uncover unknown coefficients in kinetic equations, including the Boltzmann equation, which describes the dynamics of dilute gases with binary collisions, and the Fokker-Planck equation, used to describe the dynamics in a plasma. Mathematical tools will be developed to provide a theoretical understanding of emerging topics on these inverse problems. Moreover, the project integrates research and education, providing training and research opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to conduct fundamental research on nonlinear kinetic equations and associated partial differential equation models in both the forward and inverse frameworks.

The second goal aims to uniquely and stably recover diffusion, absorption, and source coefficients from boundary measurements using the Fokker-Planck equation. The third goal involves an analysis of the Wigner equation and Schrödinger equations, with the purpose of understanding the relationship between quantum and classical mechanics.

Although the problem of estimating the degree of entanglement of quantum states has a relatively long history, this issue and its consequences are far from being fully understood. In particular, a quantitative understanding of how the amount and type of available entanglement relates to the performance of quantum algorithms remains largely elusive despite the well-known fact that entanglement empowers the computational speedups over classical algorithms. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a new framework for the analysis and design of quantum algorithms by connecting algorithm performance to the degree of entanglement of quantum states. In the literature, quantum circuits have been the most pervasive model to understand the performance of quantum algorithms. The circuitry models are, however, limited to the study of computational complexity of quantum algorithms, which do not directly exploit nor quantify entanglement as a fundamental resource for algorithm analysis. The framework presented in this project will complement the existing one leading to new perspectives in quantum algorithm development. During the course of the project a new course on quantum algorithms will be developed, adding to a long-term goal of a Graduate Certificate Program on quantum computing, traditional computer science courses will be updated with either prerequisite materials or introductions on quantum information science. To increase awareness of quantum science and its diverse career opportunities, the research team will continue to host outreach workshops for high school STEM educators to develop effective quantum science curricular and to improve confidence in teaching the subject to high school students.<br/><br/><br/>This project studies the theory of entanglement estimation, which is based on the concept of generic random states. Generic states are quantum states generated at random according to certain distributions. The use of generic random states has become increasingly important in modern quantum science. Ensembles of random states underlie our understanding of complexity of quantum circuits as well as the development of entanglement estimation theory. Random states also find applications in benchmarking quantum devices and testing quantum advantage. The focus of Thrust 1 is on entropy-based estimation and metric-based estimation. For entropy-based estimation, the exact statistical performance of the generalized entropy that reduces to the standard entropies including Renyi entropy, von Neumann entropy, and quantum purity will be obtained. For metric-based estimation, the non-asymptotic behavior of key entanglement metrics of fidelity and volumes in quantum computing will be investigated. In Thrust 2, major generic state models will be utilized to uncover the deep connection between entanglement estimators and algorithm performance. The focus is on quantum circuit cutting algorithms in the context of state tomography and quantum simulation algorithms in the context of quantum optimization algorithms. An integral part of the project will be the evaluation and verification of some of the project findings using IBM Quantum Simulators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this context, patterns refer to recurrent geometric spatial structures, and occur in a variety of physical domains.   In both natural and experimental settings, spatio-temporal heterogeneities, such as impurities, external forcing, dynamic quenching, and slow evolution of system parameters have been shown to select the type of structure formed in a system and mediate the formation of defects. This project is motivated and organized by three examples: directional quenching in light-sensitive chemical reaction systems, slow spatial ramping in fluid convection rolls, and defect formation in slowly quenched systems. It seeks to rigorously understand the interaction of dynamic heterogeneities with patterns in important and relevant mathematical models, and will focus on how heterogeneities can induce novel behavior not observed in spatially homogeneous settings.  The results of this project will aid in the understanding of pattern formation in many other scientific domains, including animal digit formation, skin patterning, tissue formation, vegetation patterning in semi-arid climates, structure formation in the early universe, and slow cooling of crystalline phases in functional materials.  The results of this project could also aid in the design and assembly of functional materials at various length scales.  The project will foster the development of early career researchers through undergraduate research experiences and graduate research projects. <br/><br/><br/>The project seeks to develop new mathematical tools to rigorously study coherent structures and their interactions with dynamic heterogeneities in prototypical partial differential equation models. It focuses on how such heterogeneities can induce dynamic bifurcations in spatially-extended systems. It will develop and apply novel techniques from finite and infinite dimensional dynamical systems theory, functional analysis, and numerical computation in three project areas, studying patterns and quasi-patterns in quenched systems, fronts and patterns in the presence of slowly-varying spatial ramps, and dynamic bifurcation of patterns via slow temporal quenching. The first area will evidence the use of the moduli space of quenched patterns in an experimentally relevant reaction-diffusion system. It also seeks to extend spatial dynamics techniques to 2- and 3-dimensional domains which do not have a single distinguished unbounded direction. In addition to gaining insight into the effect of quenching and other heterogeneities on patterns in such domains, these techniques will be widely useful in many different settings across the field of nonlinear waves and coherent structures. It will also study how heterogeneities affect the formation of seldom studied super-lattice and quasi-patterns. The second and third project areas will also contribute in several ways to the recently flourishing field of dynamic bifurcation in PDEs. The second area will investigate how slow spatial ramps select and control patterns, while the third will reveal new front, pattern, and defect formation phenomena through such slowly-varying temporal quenches. Both will study new types of dynamic bifurcation in PDEs, and develop new tools in infinite-dimensional geometric singular perturbation theory, such as slow invariant manifolds, and geometric blow-up for systems in the presence of neutral continuous spectrum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mixtures such as blood and urine contain thousands of molecules that reflect the normal functions taking place within the human body.  Hidden within these complicated fluids can be molecular clues about diseases or disorders, that if detected early can aid in their treatment.  Dr. Dunn and his group are developing new approaches to rapidly detect these molecules by separating mixtures through small capillaries that are as thin as a human hair.  The thin wall of the capillary enables unique control over fundamental separation parameters which will be developed to enhance detection.  The research plan combines fundamental studies with applied measurements and elements of engineering, thus exposing students to a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative research environment.  Combined with a novel sample droplet delivery system, the fully integrated analysis platform has the potential to provide significant new capabilities for separations science. This research project will train undergraduate and graduate students in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment, leading to enhanced opportunities for professional development.<br/><br/>Planar capillary electrophoresis (PCE) uses a short length capillary to rapidly separate and detect species in complex mixtures.  The PCE uses a 10 cm total length capillary (50 um i.d. x 80 um o.d.) with an ultra-thin capillary wall (15 um) that efficiently dissipates heat and mitigates the effects of Joule heating.  The utiization of an ultra-thin wall provides particular opportunities for developing new approaches and probing fundamental processes.  For example, it facilitates the use of an externally applied field to modify the zeta potential and control electroosmotic flow (EOF).  This allows facile control of the EOF and leads to a significant increase in peak efficiency.  The mechanism for the latter will be fully explored through experiment and simulation and optimized to improve performance.  The thin capillaries are also highly flexible, enabling looped geometries that bring the separation path across the detection zone multiple times.  This will be developed for kinetic studies of ligand-binding.  Finally, the small capillary diameter will enable coupling with digital microfluidics (DMF) to develop fully integrated analysis and economical platforms that have great potential in terms of versatility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semiconducting polymers are an exciting class of optoelectronic materials because of their solution processability, low cost, and structural tunability.  These characteristics make them useful in a range of organic electronic devices, including photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, light-emitting diodes, and transistors.  However, the conformational freedom of conjugated polymers leads to intrinsic disorder that can result in poor electrical conductivity and hence limited commercial applicability.  This research will address these issues and use organic synthesis, structural studies, and modern spectroscopy to explore water-soluble amphiphilic semiconducting polymers that self-assemble into cylindrical micelles as a way to straighten polymer chains and reduce defects without the need for a crystalline network.  The efforts toward controlling polymer self-assembly while interrogating chain conformation with respect to carrier mobility have the potential for broad impact in the field of organic electronics and could lead to a development of new and low-cost polymeric systems for a variety of applications in which temperature and/or light are converted to electricity and vice versa.  The project will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to be involved in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. In an effort to bring the ideas of nanostructured materials, organic electronics, and self-assembly to a broader audience, experiments related to this work will be brought to secondary school classrooms throughout the greater Los Angeles area via a series of graduate-student run workshops for teachers. <br/><br/>This research will focus on the synthesis of micelle-forming amphiphilic conjugated polymers based on poly(cyclopentadithiophene)-alt-thiophene (PCT) backbones, and will investigate of how their assembled structure controls charge mobility upon doping.  In the first objective, organic synthesis and amphiphilic assembly will be used to precisely control the position of charge-balancing counterions in chemically-doped PCT polymers.  PCT-based polymers with cationic, anionic, non-ionic, and zwitterionic size chains will be prepared and solution-phase small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) will be used to characterize micelle formation.  Doping will be achieved with iron(III) salts in water and the number and nature of charge carriers will be probed using steady-state and transient IR/visible absorption spectroscopy.  Based on theoretical calculations and modeling, doubly charged side chains and/or divalent solution-phase counterions will be employed to control polaron pairing into bipolarons at high doping densities. In order to create systems where the anionic side chains serve as counterions for the polarons, copolymers of anionic and either zwitterionic or non-ionic polymers will be applied. Such an approach will eliminate the need for additional ions in solution.  The second objective will target new polymer backbones that are easier to chemically dope.  The final goal will seek to develop methods to transition optimized assemblies from aqueous solutions into the solid state to create new materials with improved conductivity.  The comprehensive approach for controlling polymer conformation and charge localization associated with this research has the potential to provide important strategies to further understand fundamental charge carrier dynamics in conjugated polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current bio-derived and synthetic materials possess random porous morphologies with wide distributions of functionalities and porosities that compromise their effective molecular transport and biocatalytic activity, especially in relationship to enantiotropic biological compounds. Therefore, deeper understanding of potentially strong and flexible membranes with long-range ordered low-dimensional structural elements is required to advance the fundamental knowledge of novel nanoporous bio-derived materials with inclusion of novel open pore organized materials with controlled and responsive channel organization.  For this purpose, we suggest using peptide segments with well-defined ability for selective interactions including chiral-related transport and magnetic clusters/atoms for coordination of open unit cells with molecular pore dimensions.  Moreover, external magnetic field can be explored to create larger-scale responsive materials with transport properties directed by its direction and strength. Experimental research will be guided and assisted by machine learning and computational approaches.  Finally, the research project will provide interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds in experimental and computational biomaterials science for advanced material and biomolecular industry.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>This proposal will consider novel classes of organized nanochannel biomolecular nanomaterials for understanding the design principles of efficient organized gel-like adaptive materials with enhanced porosity dimension and topological control, materials and energy transport, chiral biomolecules selection and storage/release, and prospective chiral biocatalytic templates. Numerous critical issues must be addressed in order to establish principles of assembly of low-defect bio-metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) such as problems with limited unit sizes and pores due to the very short peptide sequences, small pore sizes, limited symmetries achievable, and high concentration of defects for directional and responsive loading, transport or potential for enantiotropic selection and biocatalytical abilities. The major novel units that the team will synthesize, design, and study are biomolecular magnetic organic frameworks (BiMOFs) based upon biologically encoded peptides with metal-binding terminal groups for coordination with magnetic ions/clusters. The key fundamental question to be addressed is how the guided co-assembly of functional biomolecular elements can be introduced as a tool for directed construction of large-scale organized hierarchical materials with stable and precisely controlled morphology of pore dimensions, channel topology, continuity, and chirality, and adaptive ionic and mass/energy transport properties. <br/>Design of biologically encoded magnetic bio-framework unit cells and biomolecular crystals of different symmetries and dimensions will be explored via site-specific metal-peptide coordination with tailored unit cell parameters, pore dimensions, channel dimensionalities, magnetic moment configuration, pores and microcrystal stability, and restructuring abilities of large-sized pores with biomolecular selectivity and chirality. The experimental work will be guided by theory, machine learning, and large-scale molecular simulations to understand the underlying scientific principles. The proposed research will leverage multi-scale modeling and machine learning powered by experimental verification to develop ?technology-specific? rules for the design and assembly of robust but adaptive nanochannel BiMOF architectures with inherent ability to reconfigure.  The work can enhance fundamental understanding of complex trasport phenomena in organized multi-phase nanomaterials with long-range organized assembly of nanocrystals and nanosheets. Finally, the PI?s mini-workshops Homecoming Series: Life and Career will be used to facilitate student readiness by interacting with former students and post-docs invited to visit their alma mater who enjoy successful careers in industry, national labs, and academia.

A number of studies have explored the use of AI technologies, such as chatbots, to improve students' reading comprehension by engaging students in interactive dialogue during reading. This approach is particularly promising for younger students who are in a critical period for developing reading skills. However, scaling up these AI resources to make them accessible and relevant to diverse learners and instructors remains a challenge. This project aims to harness recent advancements in AI, particularly large language models, to enable teachers to collaborate with AI in creating interactive reading resources that ask students questions, listen to and interpret student responses, and provide tailored feedback to students during reading, focusing on students from kindergarten to second grade. This will allow teachers to contribute their expertise to develop AI resources tailored to their students' needs. The project will shed light on whether the extensive manual labor involved in chatbot development, typically performed by content creators, designers, and engineers, can be significantly reduced through AI-teacher collaboration, and whether the resulting chatbots effectively support teachers' instruction and promote students? reading comprehension. <br/><br/>This project will be carried out in four stages. This first stage involves the development of innovative AI models to automatically generate question-answer pairs based on reading materials teachers select. The models will be tailored to meet the unique requirements of educational contexts. In the second stage, a user-friendly teacher-AI collaborative system will be developed through a contextual inquiry and participatory design process. This system will enable teachers to verify and modify the question-answer pairs generated by AI and subsequently incorporate them into a chatbot that engages students in dialogue. Teachers' modifications to the question-answer pairs will feed back to the system so that the AI models can gradually learn and adapt to each individual teacher's preferences. In the third stage, the research team will develop the chatbot's capability for adaptive interaction so that it can carry out dialogue and provide scaffolding based on both the accuracy and sentiment of students' responses. The fourth stage will involve an examination of the usability and effectiveness of the teacher-AI collaborative system and resulting chatbot in supporting personalized instruction and assessment. To this end, the research team will carry out a field test involving an under-power randomized controlled trial. Five teachers and their approximately 150 students will be recruited to participate, with half of the students in each class randomly assigned to read interactive texts with a chatbot generated by their teacher while the other half reads the original text without the chatbot. Observations and interviews with teachers and students will shed light on the usability of the teacher-AI co-created interactive reading materials. Students' post-reading comprehension will be assessed to provide evidence on the system's educational impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cremer of Pennsylvania State University will explore the rules for ion pairing at chemically treated interfaces. The surfaces of many organic-based substances are charged in water. Examples include everything from colloids in water-based paints to proteins residing in cell membranes. Negatively charged surfaces attract positively charged metal ions from the adjacent solution. This study will help determine how metal ions from salts interact with negatively charged surfaces. The answers to this question have relevance in the biological and environmental sciences on the one hand, and materials science and engineering problems on the other. This research will also train a new generation of students using a combination of experimental physical chemistry techniques that involve laser light. The students will also get experience from working with theoretical collaborators who will help model ion-pairing data. The results are expected to provide information not only on how tightly ions bind to charged surfaces but also give important details on how the chemical composition of a surface influences ion binding. The results will be applicable to a wide range of practical problems ranging from the most effective way to soften drinking water to the guidance of pharmaceutical drug manufacturing. Work will also be conducted in association with high school chemistry teachers to develop new week-long laboratories for high school students that take advantage of ion pairing to partition food coloring into salt rich liquid phases. The goal will be to create experiments that can be conducted without the need for complex equipment or expensive chemicals.<br/><br/>Experiments will be performed using infrared-visible sum frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS) to probe the interactions of Hofmeister ions with Langmuir monolayers of long chain surfactants at the air/water interface. The vibrational spectra should contain information on interfacial water structure, alkyl chain ordering and headgroup hydration. In these experiments, both positively and negatively charged headgroups will be employed. This will include studies of carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate, and phosphate anionic headgroups as well as amine and trimethylamine cationic headgroups. A key feature of these experiments will be to conduct measurements as a function of interfacial charge density. This will be accomplished by using long chain fatty alcohols as filler surfactants to tune the mole fraction of charged headgroups. The order of binding for counterions will be noted and equilibrium binding constants will be measured for each counterion that is employed. Special attention will also be paid to conditions that lead to contact ion pair formation as opposed to solvent-shared ion pairing. Where appropriate, complementary data in bulk solution on ion pairing will be obtained by using multicurve resolution Raman spectroscopy. These types of systematic measurements should enable the elucidation of a set of rules that govern counterion pairing at macromolecular interfaces as a function of chemical identity and interfacial structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing this predictive capability is critical to the ongoing efforts to create a global model of the flow of energy from the Sun, through the interplanetary medium, and out to the boundary of the heliosphere. To reach clear understanding of the channels of collisionless energy transport necessary for achieving this goal, this project will reconcile the existing collisionless energy transport models and produce a model that is consistent with both fluid and kinetic plasma theory. This post-doctoral fellowship is led by an early-career woman PI. The broader impacts include support for the PI in developing her research, outreach, and teaching capabilities.<br/><br/>In recent years, two major models of energy transport in collisionless plasma turbulence have been suggested: a fluid model and a kinetic model. Diagnostic tools for studying each of these models for collisonless energy transfer are the Pi-D and field-particle correlation (FPC) technique, respectively. Despite rigorous theoretical footing within their respective limits (fluid and kinetic theory), the two models appear to be incompatible and it is not clear how the diagnostic techniques that have arisen from them may be used in concert. Furthermore, questions have been raised regarding the unknown consequences of these diagnostics omitting certain terms that may be important for particle energization (such as the heat flux or ballistic particle motion) and regarding the contexts (i.e. global vs. local) in which these analysis techniques are applicable. Reconciling the two models and their diagnostics is critical in order for the community to arrive at an unequivocal description of the process of collisionless energy transport and to understand the conditions where global and local methods can be used in the study of collisionless energy transport. In the heliosphere, this knowledge informs the flow of resources in both spacecraft design and simulation development. To this end, this is a timely research project that will, by resolving discrepancies between the two leading models of energy transport in collisionless plasma turbulence, (i) elucidate the channels of collisionless energy transport within the heliosphere, and (ii) clarify the use of Pi-D and the FPC technique to determine how well these methods capture system dynamics, both locally and globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Globally, disease and habitat loss lead to biodiversity loss. In agricultural landscapes, bees sometimes have less food from flowering plants and can be exposed to more disease. However, mass blooming cover crops that produce large amounts of flowers could improve conditions for bees. For example, increased food supply from mass blooming crops may improve bee nutrition and disease resistance. Additionally, mass blooms could either reduce or increase chances for bees to spread diseases at shared flowers, likely depending on the amount of other, non-crop flowers in the surrounding landscape. Identifying the contexts in which different farming practices can support pollinators improves conservation efforts. This project asks how non-crop flower abundance affects the extent to which mass blooming cover crops affect bee disease resistance and spread.<br/><br/>This research will use an agriculturally important native bee, Osmia lignaria, and its associated pathogens to evaluate how resource pulses from a cover crop (vetch, Vicia villosa) interact with the surrounding landscape (abundance of non-mass bloom floral resources, NMBR) to affect bee immunity, pathogen infection, and pathogen transmission. The fellow will place Osmia lignaria nests at sites manipulated to either have or not have mass blooming vetch. Sites in the mass bloom and control treatments will each exist along a gradient of NMBR. To assess how mass bloom affects pathogen infection, adult bees will be sampled throughout bloom, and larvae and pollen provisions will be sampled at the end of bloom to quantify pathogens and nutrients. To assess how mass bloom affects opportunities for disease transmission, total and infected bee and flower density will be quantified in vetch and NMBR patches. To assess whether mass bloom and NMBR affect immunity, the fellow will conduct an immune challenge and measure immune gene expression in bees fed pollen from diets that mimic the quality and quantity of floral resources at each site, in laboratory experiments. By disentangling landscape- versus molecular-scale drivers of host-pathogen dynamics, this work will improve predictive power of when pathogens affect populations and communities. The fellow will extend the impact of their work by 1) training two undergraduate students, 2) conducting trainings on inclusive teaching in Biology, and 3) communicating results and investigating applications with conservation and agricultural professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Flowering timing (phenology) is regulated by a well-characterized network of genes that respond to known environmental and developmental signals in controlled conditions in sunflowers and other species. Our research builds on this foundational work to investigate the genetics of climate adaptation and translate functional genetic information into predictive models of plant performance under heterogeneous field conditions.

Furthermore, the lack of collaborative CPS learning tools has resulted in a trend of solitary learning practices among students, which contradicts the collaborative nature of CPS design practice. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by designing and implementing a physical computing testbed that will foster problem-based, collaborative learning of CPS concepts. The testbed will allow groups of students, co-located around a table, to interact with CPS using a tangible-user interface.

The project will first engage CPS experts in academia and industry through a Delphi study to seek consensus on the fundamental concepts necessary for CPS mastery. Next, the research approach will intersect threshold concepts with collaborative problem-based learning (PBL) to identify key formative learning experiences necessary for mastering CPS design concepts. These key formative learning experiences, anchored in student-centered threshold concepts, will be investigated by engaging students in multi-stage problem scenarios called model-eliciting activities. During the model-eliciting activities, their interactions with one another and the testbed will be analyzed using constructivist grounded theory. A comprehensive CPS concept inventory and innovative classification of threshold concepts will be created by integrating the various data sources, leading to a new understanding of how best to leverage PBL and physical computing in CPS education. The findings will improve CPS learning capabilities in academia and enhance CPS design capabilities for practitioners, strengthening the core function of U.S. federal agencies in administering CPS ecosystems with broad societal impacts.

Populations of invasive species (i.e., species that have been introduced to an environment where they do not naturally occur) that live in cities may evolve in response to urban conditions in ways that may cause them to spread faster, become harder to control, and cause damage to agriculture and native plants and wildlife. However, it is not known if invasive species in cities tend to evolve in particular directions due to higher urban temperature gradients, or if other factors are more important, like the underlying genetic variability of populations, regardless of the environmental setting. This research will generate critical data on how and why cities affect the spread of invasive species.

Outreach activities include inspiring broad public awareness in the exciting opportunities in magnetic device domains. <br/><br/>The approach used in the project is based on the phenomenon of spin torque oscillator, which is one promising technique for realizing on-chip microwave sources, detectors, and neuromorphic computing devices. Existing spin torque oscillators suffer from challenges in low output power, broad linewidth as well as the requirement for complicated external supporting circuits, which greatly limits their practical applications. In this project, to overcome these difficulties, a new approach for realizing coherent magnetic self-oscillation in a large area ferromagnetic thin film by placing a spin torque oscillator into a microwave resonator is conceived. The mutual interactions between the magnet and microwave resonator will lead to a coupling between their oscillation dynamics, which will further result in macroscopic phase coherence in magnetic free layer with very large area. By fabricating the proposed device structures and testing on the microwave input-output relationship, the proposed device structure will not only result in a novel coherent, high power, on-chip microwave source, but also enrich people?s understanding on spin dynamics and the coupling physics between magnets and microwave.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the planetary motion in celestial mechanics, the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid and the motion of a charged particle in an electro-magnetic field are usually treated as Hamiltonian dynamical systems. Topological entropy is an important invariant of a dynamical system, measuring its complexity and originating in physics and information theory. The PIs will develop new methods and tools to study topological entropy of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, utilizing ideas from topological data analysis. Conversely, this research has a potential to contribute to the field of topological data analysis and applied questions including image and pattern recognition. The  work involves integration of research, education and training young scientists. It will have impact in the areas of higher education and dissemination of knowledge, within the field and to a wider scientific community, and it will increase participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, the main theme of the project is the interaction between Floer theory and symplectic topology on one side and Hamiltonian dynamics and, in particular, topological entropy on the other. The PIs will study topological entropy of compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and certain Reeb flows from the perspective of Floer theory. The project builds on the PIs? recent work and focuses on barcode entropy introduced by the PIs, which is a Floer theoretic counterpart of topological entropy and is closely related to it. The key new and distinguishing feature of the PIs? approach to Floer theoretic aspects of topological entropy is that barcode entropy is based on neither exponential growth of Floer homology ? there is no growth in the Hamiltonian setting ? nor on topological properties of the map such as the growth of free homotopy classes of periodic orbits. The PIs will also study the behavior of the gamma-norm under iterations in the Hamiltonian or contact setting. Most of the projects will require developing new techniques applicable to other questions, and interactions with areas outside symplectic geometry and dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advances in AI technology and energy as a service market further fuel the convergence of these two drivers, resulting in the emergence of a new field of research in the energy sector ? the Internet of Energy (IoE). With IoE, renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), such as electric cars, storage batteries, wind turbines and photovoltaics, can be connected and integrated for reliable energy distribution by leveraging advanced 5G-6G networks and AI technology. This allows DER owners as prosumers to participate in the energy market and derive economic incentives. DERs are inherently asset-driven and face equitable challenges (i.e., fair, diverse and inclusive). Without equitable access, privileged individuals, groups and organizations can participate and benefit at the cost of disadvantaged groups. The real-time management of DER resources not only brings out the equity problem to the IoE, it also collects highly sensitive location, time, activity dependent data, which requires to be handled responsibly (e.g., privacy, security and safety), for AI-enhanced predictions, for optimization and prioritization services, and for automated management of flexible resources. This US-Australia joint project plans to develop Equitable and Responsible AI framework, techniques and algorithms for the Internet of Energy, coined as RAI4IoE, aiming to elevate ""energy poverty"" by providing secure, privacy-preserving and equitable access to the networks of DERs for every citizen. The outcome of this research will advance the knowledge of responsible AI as the first principle in developing and deploying the IoE systems and services, in facilitating DER integration, promoting deep engagement with prosumers, aggregators and network operators, and enabling flexibility market of renewable energy supply.<br/><br/>To facilitate equitable participation of all DER owners and users in the automated flexibility market, AI enabled IOE should be governed by the responsible AI frameworks and guidelines for distributed monitoring, scheduling, management, and consumption of DERs, while exercising and guaranteeing responsible and equitable AI through ensuring AI fairness and safeguarding AI privacy and AI security in an open and continuously evolving IoE ecosystem. This project will develop responsible AI frameworks, algorithms and compliance evaluation methods for the IoE, aiming to elevate ""energy poverty"" by providing secure, privacy-preserving and equitable access to the networks of DERs for every citizen. The project will develop innovative solutions along three dimensions. First, it develops an equitable AI framework for ensuring IoE for all, including enabling asset-poor clients to participate in distributed learning of global DER models, and integrating privacy and fairness-aware DER data collection with policy-driven data governance. Second, it develops a suite of responsible AI Algorithms and Models to increase the end-to-end resilience of IoE against disruptive events, including irregular, sparse or corrupted data, biases in data and algorithms, privacy violations, and other fraudulent DER activities. Third, it develops a suite of responsible and equitable AI compliance methods by combining explainable AI with software testing and verification methods. The research findings will lead to new generations of AI-enhanced distributed energy resource management systems. This research will also provide graduate and under-graduate students with diverse backgrounds the unique opportunities to learn responsible AI algorithm development, and the importance of equitable access to DERs from a broad cross-disciplinary perspective.<br/><br/><br/>This is a joint project between U.S. and Australian researchers funded by the Collaboration Opportunities in Responsible and Equitable AI under the U.S. NSF and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, given the relative youth of CPS technology, a crucial challenge lies in characterizing what key concepts are necessary for CPS mastery. Furthermore, the lack of collaborative CPS learning tools has resulted in a trend of solitary learning practices among students, which contradicts the collaborative nature of CPS design practice. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by designing and implementing a physical computing testbed that will foster problem-based, collaborative learning of CPS concepts. The testbed will allow groups of students, co-located around a table, to interact with CPS using a tangible-user interface. As a generative source of informal learning and sense-making, the testbed will help foster a social approach to CPS education, while advancing our understanding of the discipline-specific concepts required for CPS mastery.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop a physical computing testbed for collaborative, problem-based CPS learning to explore and characterize the CPS discipline?s threshold concepts ? which represent transformative, and potentially difficult-to-grasp, ideas that integrate multiple concepts in a given discipline. The project will first engage CPS experts in academia and industry through a Delphi study to seek consensus on the fundamental concepts necessary for CPS mastery. Next, the research approach will intersect threshold concepts with collaborative problem-based learning (PBL) to identify key formative learning experiences necessary for mastering CPS design concepts. These key formative learning experiences, anchored in student-centered threshold concepts, will be investigated by engaging students in multi-stage problem scenarios called model-eliciting activities. During the model-eliciting activities, their interactions with one another and the testbed will be analyzed using constructivist grounded theory. A comprehensive CPS concept inventory and innovative classification of threshold concepts will be created by integrating the various data sources, leading to a new understanding of how best to leverage PBL and physical computing in CPS education. The findings will improve CPS learning capabilities in academia and enhance CPS design capabilities for practitioners, strengthening the core function of U.S. federal agencies in administering CPS ecosystems with broad societal impacts. The testbed will empower undergraduate students to engage in CPS learning through collaborative play, and the knowledge generated will benefit industry, defense, and critical infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum confined semiconductor NCs are promising novel materials with potential applications in energy conversion and quantum information science.  In this project, the first aim is focused on using polaritons formed by coupling NCs with optical cavity modes as a new way to control photoinduced ET. The second aim is focused on NC Donor-chiral Bridge-Acceptor (D-B-A) complexes for selective transfer of light generated spins using chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effects. The goals of the research  are: 1) to advance the understanding of the formation and decay dynamics of polariton states; 2) to directly measure polariton mediated ET in NC-molecular acceptor complexes in cavity and test theoretical models; 3) to develop design principles for NCs with both slow electron spin relaxation and fast ET rates; and 4) to advance the understanding CISS effect in photoinduced ET in NC-chiral bridge-acceptor complexes.<br/><br/>Molecular polaritons, formed by coupling the molecular electronic or vibrational transition to a photonic cavity mode have received intense interest in chemistry since the reports that they can provide a novel approach for controlling chemical reactions. The proposed effort is focused on polariton mediated electron transfer because of its potential roles in polariton enabled chemical reactions. The proposed study will provide much needed experimental data to test current models of polariton state dynamics and polariton mediated ET, as well as important insights on how to use cavities to control ET rates for many potential applications.  Controlling electron spin states is essential for spintronics and quantum information. Although electron spins can be selectively transferred during transport through chiral materials, this process is not understood at the quantitative level. The proposed NC donor-chiral bridge-acceptor platform represents a new approach to combine photonics with spintronics for potential applications in quantum information processing. The proposed study will lead to the development of design principles for NCs with both slow electron spin relaxation and fast ET rates and advance the understanding of the CISS effect in photoinduced ET in NC-chiral bridge-acceptor complexes.

The balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission varies between different cell types and environmental conditions, allowing for the formation of both topologically connected physical networks and social networks of globular units that engage in transient interactions. As a population, mitochondria must be able to rapidly deliver signals and metabolic products to far-flung cellular regions, to maintain their own health and energy-producing capacity, and to respond in a concerted manner to environment changes. <br/><br/>This award will develop a fundamental understanding of how the dynamics of mitochondrial populations gives rise to their spatial structure and mediates the transport of material through the population. The research approach will focus on the development of mathematical and physical models that link morphology and mixing dynamics on networks. The award aims for a general framework that will tie together behavior of social and physical networks. These models will help establish how a wide variety of mitochondrial features arises from a handful of basic parameters, including local fusion and fission rates, processive transport rates, and the geometry of the cellular domain. The theoretical work will be carried out in close collaboration with experimental measurements of mitochondrial populations. This work will deepen our understanding of a functionally critical organelle population whose structure and dynamics play a fundamentally important role in cellular health and whose perturbations are associated with a broad variety of human disorders, from neuropathies to cancer and aging.<br/><br/>An integrated educational program will be developed to promote student interest and competency in cross-disciplinary scientific inquiry, targeting elementary to undergraduate students.

Much of today's AI research relies on access to large volumes of data and advanced computational power, which are often unavailable to researchers not located at well-resourced technology companies and universities. This divide limits the ability of researchers to leverage AI to tackle the big challenges in our society. It further constrains the diversity of researchers and the breadth of ideas incorporated into AI innovations, thereby contributing to embedded biases and other systemic inequalities found in AI systems today.

In doing so, DeltaAI will greatly expand the AI-focused computing capacity available within the NSF-funded advanced computing ecosystem. The DeltaAI system builds upon the efforts and successes of NCSA?s Delta system in a way that is seamless and leverages the existing NSF investment in that infrastructure. This approach is achieved by deploying DeltaAI using similar system and storage hardware, and the same high-speed interconnect. A vast array of next-generation graphics processors (GPUs) delivers a technological leap in AI computing capability that will make DeltaAI the keystone in the NSF AI computing portfolio for years to come.

The design of graft copolymers involves the incorporation of dissimilar polymeric side chains into a linear backbone, resulting in the formation of novel ordered nanostructures that are not easily attainable with other materials. The integration of functional nanoparticles into specific domains or interfaces of these nanostructured polymers will enhance their respective functional properties through precisely defined interactions between particles and polymers.

Precisely defined side chain sequences in mGBCPs enable the formation of ordered hierarchical nanostructures across a broad range of characteristic length scales. Co-assembly of these mGBCPs with inorganic nanoparticles results in hierarchically structured nanocomposites with control over the size, geometry, and orientation of formed nanoparticle arrays. By rationally engineering the mGBCP structures and polymer-nanoparticle interactions, electronic band structures, photoenergy transfer behaviors, and thermomechanical properties of the nanocomposites can be precisely tuned or optimized.

In plasmon-driven photocatalysis, the collective oscillation of free electrons drives chemical reactions on the surfaces of metal nanostructures, but the relative contributions of non-thermal plasmonic effects versus surface heating to the observed enhancement are debated. The Pickel group will develop a spectroscopic technique that employs the temperature-dependent luminescence of individual upconverting nanoparticles for thermometry while simultaneously monitoring the chemical reaction via enhanced Raman scattering from the reacting molecules. Their discoveries could lead to a better understanding of whether heating plays an important role in catalyzing plasmon-enhanced reactions. Dr. Pickel will also develop an undergraduate lab course based on luminescence thermometry and an educational activity focused on plasmonic sensing for local elementary school students. <br/><br/>Current approaches for isolating thermal contributions to plasmonic photocatalysis measure temperature via the same surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra used to monitor the chemical reactions. These spectra, however, depend on local chemical and electromagnetic effects that can vary through a measurement, which makes elucidation of plasmonic heating difficult to separate. To provide high-fidelity operando thermometry during plasmonic photocatalysis, a single laser will be used to both excite upconverting nanoparticle (UCNP) thermometers and photocatalyze a chemical reaction. The thermometry and reaction monitoring signals naturally separate in the spectral domain due to the large anti-Stokes shift of the UCNP luminescence. Several objectives will be investigated including understanding how different the plasmonic environment affects the temperature-dependent UCNP luminescence, fabricating substrates with different thermal properties yet near-identical plasmonic properties, and using nanomanipulation to place UCNP thermometers with spectrally distinct emission at strategic locations on plasmonic nanostructures. These studies have the potential to elucidate the importance of thermal contributions to plasmonic photocatalysis as well as have broad applications in chemistry for systems in which the intrinsic spectral separation of the UCNP emission and Raman spectra originating from analytes or biomolecules is likewise advantageous.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An outstanding case is that of power-grid networks, which rely on synchronization among power generators to operate. In the mathematical modeling of such systems, the networks are usually represented by the dynamical entities that define the nodes and the network structure that defines the interactions among nodes. Because contemporary research in network science emphasizes the role of interactions in giving rise to emergent behavior, existing studies have focused mainly on the optimization of the network structure for given nodes. Recent research has shown, however, that in many situations it is more desirable to optimize the node parameters, and this is a problem for which adequate methods do not currently exist. This project will develop and apply mathematical and computational methods to improve synchronization stability of relevance to the U.S. power-grid network by optimizing node parameters. Successful completion of the planned research is expected to lead to design and operation principles that can improve power-grid stability. The project will also provide interdisciplinary research training to one graduate student and several undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The project builds on the recent observation that explicit symmetry breaking can often be used to stabilize synchronization states in network systems. Implementation of this idea requires solving a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem that cannot be satisfactorily addressed by existing linear methods. The project will develop and apply a rigorous nonlinear method tailored to address this class of optimization problems in power-grid networks. The project consists of four parts: 1) the development of a nonlinear, second-order theory, 2) the development of an iterative numerical algorithm implementing the theory, 3) the application of the resulting methods to the U.S. power-grid network, and 4) the application of the methods to study conditions under which explicit symmetry breaking can benefit stability. The expected outcomes will lead to new opportunities for the stabilization of desired synchronous states and an improved understanding of the factors that contribute to stability. The project is interdisciplinary and will provide research training to one Ph.D. student and three summer undergraduate students, including students underrepresented in STEM, thereby advancing workforce development while promoting inclusion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to James Satterlee is ?Overcoming barriers to wild species improvement through genetic analysis of an evolutionary novelty in the Solanum?. The host institution for the fellowship is the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Zachary Lippman.<br/><br/>How do genetic differences result in the evolutionarily novel traits observed across the tree of life, such as flowers in flowering plants or limbs in vertebrate animals? This research will address this question using the plant genus Solanum as a model system. Solanum contains familiar major crop species such as tomato, potato, and eggplant. Unlike tomato and potato however, the lineage that gave rise to eggplant evolved sharp prickles on their surface to deter herbivores. During the domestication of eggplant and other closely related regionally important crops, breeders selected cultivars lacking prickles. Using this trait variation as a starting point, this work will first identify the genes that control the development of prickles and then seek to address which types of genetic changes occurred to allow these genes to take on their new function(s). Practically, an understanding of the genetic control of prickle development will allow the rapid engineering of desirable prickle-less lines in agriculturally useful Solanum species. This project will include a public outreach component involving short-form scientific videos for social media dissemination as well as a yearly course open to the public on genome editing and crop improvement. <br/><br/>The underlying genetic changes that give rise to phenotypic novelty remain poorly understood. Evolution of new gene function can be driven by changes in the cis-regulatory DNA sequence surrounding the gene coding sequence. Such sequence changes may allow a gene to take on a new expression pattern, conferring function in a new place or time while avoiding potential pleiotropic effects of coding sequence mutations. In this way, it is hypothesized that ancestral gene functions may be redeployed in a new context to produce morphological novelty with a conserved molecular toolkit. This research will test this hypothesis through an investigation of the genetic basis for the evolution of prickles, a relatively recent (~16 My old) morphological innovation, in the agriculturally important genus Solanum. New high-quality genome assemblies will be leveraged to map and identify genes involved in prickle development in multiple species. Next, this work will aim to understand how these genes were recruited into the prickle developmental pathway using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, open chromatin profiling, and comparative genomic analysis to link prickle-associated gene expression patterns to their underlying regulatory basis. Genome editing will be used to verify the functions of candidate genes and their cis-regulatory sequences. Finally, heterologous expression of candidate drivers of prickle development will determine their sufficiency and relevance to the evolutionary emergence of novelty. Together, this work will advance understanding of the emergence of innovative traits in evolution and may suggest routes for the synthetic engineering of novel morphologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, groups appear in the study of shapes of geometric objects, crystals and quasi-crystals, structure of roots of polynomials, cryptography, algorithm design etc. The study of finite groups, i.e. groups with finitely many elements, has reached a fairly mature stage, accumulating to a complete classification of finite simple groups. However, most infinite groups are fairly mysterious and hard to understand. In the 1980s, Gromov proposed a geometric approaches to group theory.  One idea was to realize the mysterious group as a collection of symmetries of some geometric objects with interesting curvature properties, allowing us to study groups from the viewpoint of geometry. This has evolved into a very active field called geometric group theory. This proposal aims to study problems in the frontier of geometric group theory, and seeks applications to some long-standing problems in topology. The proposal also aims to provide resources for training graduate students and postdocs working in the area at the Ohio State University, with an emphasis on supporting under-represented early career stage mathematicians at OSU working in this filed.<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with rigidity and curvature properties of some infinite discrete groups from the viewpoint of geometric group theory, combined with ideas and techniques from ergodic theory, metric geometry, metric graph theory and combinatorial group theory. The project has two more specific research goals. The first is to make progress on a major conjecture on Artin groups, using a new strategy motivated from ideas in metric graph theory. The second is to understand fundamental forms of rigidity for discrete groups, namely quasi-isometric rigidity and measure equivalence rigidity. The project emphasizes the close connections between these forms of rigidity and the curvature properties of singular metric spaces and groups. Several classes of groups of fundamental importance are studied, including Artin groups, CAT(0) groups, graph products etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, the project brings together rural teachers to foster authentic community around shared work of improving student learning. Second, professional learning and instructional support for teachers promote adoption and implementation of effective instructional practices in the crucial settings of grades 6-8 mathematics classrooms. Third, the project centers shared responsibility and autonomy through a statewide teacher-researcher alliance structure. Fourth, the project studies two high quality math professional development structures at scale for rural teachers: at-a-distance professional development facilitated by a centralized specialist, and in-person professional development facilitated by a local teacher-leader.

This project addresses the need for establishing universal guarantees for sparse recovery of signals that are related to both the mathematical structure of the dictionary as well as the geometric conditions that are used to synthesize the signal. These results will be used for developing requirements and recovery guarantees for accurate machine learning predictions from a sparsely generated signals, detecting emerging hot spots in an epidemic spreading through a network of cities, and detecting symmetries in molecular dynamics to reduce the relevant data when calculating various quantities such as binding energies. The project also involves the training of graduate students in the mathematical, computational, and interdisciplinary aspects of this project.   <br/><br/>The expected outcomes of the project include the following goals with broad relevance in data science. The first is the accurate recovery of signals that are sparsely synthesized in a finite or infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel space from noisy measurements. Sparse recovery is a central part of support vector regression, which will be carried out for radial Gaussian kernels in high-dimensional spaces. These results from sparse recovery are expected to give insight in the choice of model parameters such as the width of the Gaussian depending on the spacing of the samples. Similar recovery guarantees will also be established for functions on graphs, when the dictionary consists of heat kernels that are indexed by the pair of a vertex and a time for the diffusion of the kernel under the heat semigroup, will also be established. These results have relevance for the detection of hot spots when an infectious disease spreads across the globe, driven by local exponential growth and diffusion between population centers. Another goal is to identify group symmetries from noisy observations of the orbit of a collection of vectors. This question of symmetry identification is motivated by an application in quantum chemistry where identifying symmetries of molecules can reduce the space of samples needed to estimate energies or force fields for molecular configurations based on electron densities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly, chemists are studying molecules of increasing complexity and size, such as complex natural products from which scientists can develop new bio-inspired drugs, where it is vital to discover the exact structures of these molecules.  A central technique in chemistry that meets this need is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  However, the more complex and large a molecule is, the more difficult it is to solve its structure.  Using statistical and related data science methods, the Rovnyak group is developing and disseminating next-generation data sampling methods that make advanced NMR analysis much faster and more accessible to chemists.

Solutions to the ?incrementation problem? of multidimensional NMR have been pursued for about three decades, through a broad family of techniques known as nonuniform sampling (NUS).  In 2D-NMR, NUS is often not used at all or only conservatively, such as 50% data reduction.  This fails to take advantage of the benefits NUS offers. This work is probing the barriers to sparser NUS and developing improved 1D-NUS schedules for advanced 2D-NMR experiments beyond the 50% threshold while ensuring high spectral fidelity.  The work includes strategies for ?super resolution? NMR spectroscopy with ultra-high incrementation values.

This project aims to develop a rubrics-based automatic assessment tool to identify individual students' misconceptions and learning deficiencies from their free-text responses, allowing instructors and students to instantly adjust their teaching and learning, and eventually enabling personalized instructions tailored to individual learners? needs, which particularly benefits students at HBCUs. The project will also provide the base for delivering research experience for both undergraduates and teachers and outreach various audiences, including public school students, increasing the literacy of the public on artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>This research proposes innovative strategies to fine-tune and calibrate the pre-trained language model, through self-supervised learning and few-shot learning, for automatic classification of texts based on user-specified rubrics, with a particular focus on learners' cognitive and metacognitive processes. The proposed model integrates three novel attributes for improving similarity comparison between texts and rubric keywords: (1) across-attention between compared texts for increasing the sensitivity of comparison; (2) joint embedding of words, phrases, and sentences for improving the accuracy of comparison; (3) incorporation of thematic relevance for enhancing the breadth of comparison. Given the assessment rubrics, the model can classify texts to reveal students? thinking or other traits in multiple finer granular perspectives. It is flexible for adding new assessment perspectives and more transparent than the overall assessment, and allows involving human judgment, leading to more reliable assessment acceptable for practice, and advancing knowledge on adapting pre-trained language models for personalized instructions. The dataset collected from diverse students and specific strategies will be adopted to mitigate the potential biases of the proposed model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, future chips are expected to age faster than previous generations. While recent advances in EM modeling and assessment techniques have been made, fast and accurate EM analysis and automatic optimization for large-scale power grid networks remain challenging due to the need for physics-based modeling that involves solving partial differential equations for hydrostatic stress in large interconnects. This becomes even more difficult for full-chip level EM management. Machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning based on deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and scientific machine learning (SciML) approaches, have emerged as promising solutions to traditional numerical analysis techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The unsupervised physics-informed/constrained neural network (PINN/PCNN) framework in the SciML field shows powerful capabilities such as mesh-free and parametrized numerical solutions. However, existing PINN/PCNN works can only solve small PDE problems with simple boundary conditions. For large engineering problems with millions of variables commonly seen in design automation, PINN/PCNN approaches show slow convergence, if they converge at all. Additionally, fixing EM-induced failure or damage to achieve the expected EM mean time to failure at both design and run times remains challenging due to the sensitivity-based optimization framework and lack of sufficient on-chip temperature sensors. The tools to be developed in this project will be valuable to advancing the understanding of this important problem and curtailing the lifetime reliability issue of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips.<br/><br/>This project will develop novel learning-based EM analysis based on PINN/PCNN framework and efficient machine learning-accelerated full-chip EM fixing and run-time management methods for VLSI chips in the nanometer regime. First, the project will explore new SciML-based solutions such as enhanced PINN/PCNN methods, for hydrostatic stress analysis for multi-segment interconnect trees. On top of those methods, full-chip multi-physics coupled EM induced IR drop (i.e., reduction in voltage) analysis and lifetime estimation for power grid networks considering Joule heating effects will be developed. Second, the project will develop efficient full-chip EM-aware power grid optimization techniques, aided by DNNs, along with a dynamic run-time EM-aware management method to identify the real hotspots of processors. The project will investigate DNN-accelerated full-chip power grid optimization by exploiting the differentiability of the trained DNN models to allow for rapid sensitivity calculations based on a sequence of linear programming techniques. Finally, we will devise a DNN-based method to estimate hotspots and develop a dynamic run-time EM lifetime management method, considering the actual hotspots of processors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The frameworks specifically addressed in this project are models for tumor growth and the robustness of machine learning classification systems to malicious attackers, the latter also known in the literature as adversarial attacks. In the case of tumor growth, the key interface is the boundary separating the cancerous region and the healthy cell region.  Tracking and predicting the shape of this boundary has important implications for disease treatment and prognosis.  The key interfaces for robust machine learning classification are the decision boundaries between different classes.  If a classifier has extremely irregular decision boundaries, then an adversary can produce erroneous results by slightly perturbing the input data.  These attacks are particularly striking in computer vision, where pixel changes that are imperceptible to human vision can fool well-trained models with high confidence.  This project will advance our knowledge in both of these applications by studying the theoretical properties of these interfaces and by developing new computational algorithms and software to simulate these interfaces. This project will also involve the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>In the case of tumor growth, the project will focus on fluid mechanical models for cell growth based on partial differential equations.  On the theoretical side, the well-posedness of these models and an understanding of how model choice and parameter regimes affect the regularity of the tumor boundary will be established.  In addition, efficient numerical solvers will be developed, paying particular attention to model instances that are too challenging for the current theoretical understanding, including models where even the global-in-time existence of weak solutions is unknown.  In the case of data classification, a better understanding of the regularizing effect that adversarial learning has on class interfaces will be established, and these insights will be used to guide parameter choices.

Species ranges are influenced by many factors, including changes in climate, shifts in ecosystems and communities, and anthropogenic influences. However, the dynamics of species ranges on geological timescales (for example, across millions of years) has not yet been fully understood. Furthermore, the study of species ranges through time is complicated by the influence of past tectonic shifts and climate change on species ranges. This project, conducted at the University of Oxford and advised by Dr. Erin Saupe, explores long-term changes in species range sizes across many different geographic extents, and types of species. It aims to quantify how species ranges fluctuate over multiple time scales, evaluate how tectonics and climate influence these fluctuations, and examine how the dynamics might be driven by relatedness and heritability between species. This project will provide new avenues of inquiry into the maintenance of biodiversity through time and will help to forge another link between the history of Earth and the history of life. During this project, the researchers will contribute to several programs aimed at increasing diversity in academia and introducing students to entire process of scientific research in geology and paleobiology. These programs include the Nuffield Research Placement Program, a month-long program where the students develop and answer their own research questions, and the UNIQ program, which sponsors high-school students from diverse and underserved communities to take short-courses in fields that interest them. Through these initiatives, the project aims to foster discussion on the vital importance of earth science in our changing world and to inspire a new cohort of dedicated earth scientists.<br/><br/>As we enter the Anthropocene, unprecedented climatic and landscape changes are leading to global extinctions and the reorganization of many species? ranges (Barnosky et al. 2011). Understanding how species ranges have changed through geological time can offer insight into these current and projected future changes. Furthermore, categorizing the dynamics of species range shifts from origination to extinction can increase the ability of conservation organizations and governments to identify and protect species that may be at risk of range loss and extinction. However, the study of species ranges through time is complicated by the extrinsic effects of spatial, taxonomic, and temporal scale (Kemp et al. 2015). Using new methods in paleo-topographic reconstruction paired with advances in paleontological databases and novel evolutionary hypotheses, this research extricates these confounding effects and evaluates multiple facets of range dynamics in the fossil record. The project has three aims: 1) to quantify how species? geographic ranges fluctuate over multiple temporal scales, 2) to examine the contribution of tectonic, geographic, and climatic factors in structuring range dynamics, and 3) to evaluate the heritability of these range size dynamics and the influence of taxonomic scale on range size fluctuations. The project will use geo-referenced Paleobiology databases, including Triton, PBDB, Neotoma, and NOW to characterize species range size through time and to determine whether the trajectories of range size across a species? evolutionary history is consistent across taxa and temporal scale. Next, fluctuations in range size will be correlated to periods of climate and tectonic changes, using temporal autoregressive models and stochastic differential equations. Finally, applying phylogenic data from published sources such as Phylacine, the influence of relatedness and heritability on range size trajectories will be evaluated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. A guiding interaction known to contribute to Earth?s biodiversity is the relationship between insect herbivores and the plants they consume. The diet of an insect is limited by the interplay between their genetics, the plant?s defensive compounds, and the insect predators which hunt them. Speciation events often occur when one of these three factors changes. However, for this to happen, novel genes must arise. One source of genetic change is through hybridization (i.e., mating between closely related but genetically distinct organisms). This project assesses the influence of hybridization on insect herbivores? diet. To do so, regions of high and low hybridization between two closely related caterpillars are evaluated. Here, lab and field experiments are conducted in collaboration with veterans from the community college system. Such collaborations provide sources of research experience not normally afforded to community college students. This effort will help to foster increased representation of veterans in STEM. <br/><br/>This research explores an overlooked and potentially powerful window into diet-breadth evolution of insect herbivores via gene flow between organisms that are potentially undergoing contemporary speciation. The fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) is an extreme generalist herbivore whose diet includes  >600 hostplant species. The fall webworm has diverged into two genetically distinct biotypes with different diet-breadths. Despite sharing geographic overlap, the timing of their life histories has maintained reproductive isolation except for a zone of hybridization occurring along their northern range limits, where their developmental phenology is constrained by a shorter seasonal window. This project takes advantage of variation in reproductive isolation to test hybridization?s downstream influence on diet breadth by conducting 1) a survey and genome sequencing of populations in a north-south transect spanning different degrees of overlap in phenology, 2) lab-based herbivore performance assays to compare hybrid performance on the biotype?s intermediate host plants, and 3) field experiments in association with veterans to evaluate differences in predation of hybrids on alternative host-associations. By exploring the role of gene flow on diet-breadth evolution, this study will contribute to determining the maintenance of contemporary and future biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Loose bolts and screws are a common problem in US infrastructure. Structural failures often have catastrophic consequences, for example, resulting in vehicle crashes or train derailments that lead to casualties, economic loss, and environmental damage. Little is known about how a structure?s dynamics influences the loosening of bolted joints over long periods of operation. Models calibrated using data from the time of assembly fail to enable optimized preventative maintenance over a structure?s lifetime. This project overcomes these challenges by developing predictive modeling approaches that capture the coupling between structural dynamics and the integrity of bolted joints over timespans consistent with the structure?s service life, leading to improved health monitoring of aging infrastructure, toughened designs against the impacts of extreme weather, and more reliable energy generation from renewable sources. The project advances STEM learning and enhances diversity through a ?Teach for Discovery? approach that engages students? natural curiosity through game-based learning and virtual reality experiences. Advise from, and outreach to, industry and national labs ensures that the research activities are informed by industry needs and that results are accessible and effectively assessed.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop the foundations of a modeling and validation framework for predicting the long-term nonlinear dynamics of assembled structures with loosening bolted joints. It achieves this aim partly by combining new experimental and modeling techniques to map the strains around a tightened bolt head to the underlying contact conditions inside the interface as the joint evolves dynamically, for example, to test the hypothesis that the rate of loosening is independent of the relative displacement across the interface. Models relating bolt tension to joint stiffness and damping and differential equations governing the evolution of the tensions are then derived from experimental measurements. Finally, the theory of nonlinear normal modes is expanded to incorporate bolt tension as a dependent variable and used to characterize the influence of internal resonances on the progression of local damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymers that contain large amounts of water, like contact lenses, are called hydrogels. One use of hydrogels involves placing these materials into the body to help overcome a biological deficiency (injury, disease, impairment, etc.). The body?s response to these ?biomaterials? is dependent upon the material properties - incompatible materials are rejected by the body. Similarly, the physical characteristics should match those of the original tissue. There is a need for more control over the biomaterials given this broad range of applications. The goal of this project is to create a new class of hydrogels that provide improved control of the material properties. This will be done through the creation of new charged, but neutral, amino acid-based molecules that hold the hydrogel together (cross-linkers). These species will react with other charged monomers creating three-dimensional hydrogel networks. Important hydrogel properties that will be investigated include the binding of biological species, the delivery of biological signals, the material physical properties, and the breakdown of the biomaterial over time. The material properties will be linked to the composition of the amino acid-based molecules. The result will be a library of new hydrogels with controlled properties for broad use. A series of experiments will also be created for professional development workshops with local high school teachers to bring this science to the classroom.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>There is a need for novel bioadaptable materials to address clinical challenges associated with biomedical therapies and other biological applications that use polymer-based materials. To be defined as bioadaptable, the material must meet four criteria: resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption, the ability to deliver specific biological signaling molecules (proteins, peptides, etc.), tunable mechanical properties, and tunable degradation behavior. Polyampholyte biomaterials show promise for being defined as bioadaptable because of their demonstrated nonfouling behavior, ability to deliver bioactive proteins, multiple approaches for controlling their mechanical properties, and tunable degradation behavior. However, a significant limitation to the advancement of these polymers is the lack of zwitterionic cross-linker molecules and a subsequent understanding of the cross-linker structure and physical property relationships that will guide their end use. The overall goal is to design and synthesize a library of peptide-based zwitterionic cross-linkers which will be incorporated into polyampholyte hydrogels to develop structure-property relationships between the cross-linker species and the resulting polymer hydrogels. This will lead to a fundamental understanding of design criteria for the cross-linker which in turn will facilitate development of bioadaptable biomaterial hydrogels. It is hypothesized that molecular-level control over the length, chemistry, charge spacing, charge density, and pendant side chain presentation will lead to the demonstration of bioadaptable polyampholyte hydrogels. This hypothesis will be tested by synthesizing peptide-based cross-linkers with controlled structure and incorporating these cross-linkers into polyampholyte hydrogels. Hydrogel performance metrics will be evaluated, resulting in a fundamental correlation of the structure-property relationships of polyampholyte hydrogel performance metrics to structural design features in the library of peptide-based zwitterionic cross-linkers. The award will provide course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) for students at the University of Idaho. The team will also provide teacher workshops to broaden knowledge in the topic of hydrogels.<br/><br/>This project is jointed funded by the Biomaterials (BMAT) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mechanical self-sensing concepts have been widely studied in diverse applications including robotics, structural sensing, healthcare and rehabilitation. Even though electro-mechanical coupling in these materials is well known, potential consumers of self-sensing materials are generally not interested in electrical properties. They would much rather know the mechanical deformation and damage that gives rise to an observed electrical change. By inverting the relationship between electrical changes and mechanical loading in these materials, it is possible to know the full-field mechanics from only a small number of electrical measurements. This research will discover the basic nature of this inverse problem, which will lead to more accurate, more robust, and faster solutions. A self-sensing mechanics education and outreach ecosystem will also be created at Purdue University. The work will leverage connections with the Society of Women Engineers and the Women in Engineering Program to integrate self-sensing mechanics into outreach activities serving the greater Lafayette/West Lafayette area. A Vertically Integrated Projects program will also be created based on the technical work. This program will positively impact a diverse cohort of undergraduate students by providing research opportunities and a mentoring network. Participants in this program will receive service-learning experience by contributing to the planned outreach activities.<br/><br/>To date, methods for inverting electro-mechanical coupling have been largely unstudied. Prior work has shown that recovering full-field mechanics from electrical data is an ill-posed inverse problem, but basic mechanics have not yet been incorporated into the inverse problem. This work seeks to make the mechanical self-sensing inverse problem stable and well-posed through the inclusion of novel mechanics-based constraints, advanced regularization and structural priors, and sensor data fusion concepts. If successful, this research will create the first intellectual pathway to in-situ quantitative full-field mechanics imaging via simple, benign, and easily multiplexed electrical measurements. Because many materials, both naturally occurring and engineered, exhibit self-sensing properties, this basic knowledge can positively affect broad areas of human health, societal prosperity, and national security. Examples include shape awareness in soft robots and morphing structures, visualization of ultra-fast loading in energetic materials, damage mapping in aging infrastructure, and, among others, tissue stiffness mapping for disease detection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary work has shown that thermally resistant corals contain unique lipids that are not present in those susceptible to bleaching.

Methods, including DNA and RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry, will be used to characterize thousands of molecules from corals during thermal stress experiments in aquaria and on live reefs in Hawai?i. The ultimate goal is to understand how these lipids contribute to bleaching resistance and to use these methods to identify thermally resistant stock for restoring threatened Hawaiian reefs. Corals will be selectively bred based on this data and monitored for bleaching years after the project?s completion to determine whether these corals remain resistant to thermal stress associated with climate change. Integrated into the project are programs to involve students. Collectively, this project will have broader impacts on coral reef restoration while synergistically introducing students to the exciting field of marine biology.<br/><br/>Reef building corals are a symbiotic association of a Cnidarian host, algal symbionts, and myriad microorganisms. Thermal stress is threatening reefs worldwide due to coral bleaching, which is a breakdown of this symbiosis that can lead to coral death. However, some corals show an inherent resistance to thermal stress, driven by interactions among its symbiotic constituents. This collaborative project will aim to understand how unique lipids from symbiotic algae and other biochemicals contribute to coral thermal resistance. Preliminary data has shown that resistant corals contain abundant, saturated ?betaine lipids?, specifically the DGCC class, which are a novel group of phosphate-free membrane lipids unique to unicellular algae. This project will use advanced metabolomics and mass spectrometry methods to characterize the biochemical relationships between symbiotic algae and their coral hosts and characterize the biosynthetic pathway for the production of the saturated betaine lipids. Resistant coral stock will be selectively bred based on their lipid profiles to improve restoration efforts. The ultimate aim is to understand the dynamism and/or plasticity of corals during thermal stress and provide a biochemical understanding of how corals will respond to dynamic environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It involves development and study of advanced polymeric materials whose molecules can form networks that can be broken and reconstituted dynamically (""dynamic covalent networks"").  They can potentially offer high performance on flue gas separation and the removal of hazardous chemicals (including both industrial pollutants and harmful biomolecules) from aqueous systems. If successful, the research activities can impact chemistry, materials, membrane science, and biomedical science. The research results of this project will be disseminated through publications and presentations. Research participation of underrepresented undergraduate students will be arranged through the SUNY LSAMP program. The project will incorporate multifaceted educational efforts including outreach to help promote science education in Buffalo?s public schools which include many students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Cyclodextrin (CD)-based polymers are promising materials for membrane separation and other applications. Dynamic covalent polymer networks have also attracted considerable interest due to their self-healing and other remarkable properties. The core hypothesis of this project is that CD-based dynamic covalent polymer networks can serve as novel membrane materials with self-healing properties and significant separation performance. Accordingly, dynamic covalent networks with building units of ?-CD (a representative form of CD) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain linking with dynamic urethane bonds will be investigated in this project. The research objectives are:  1) to establish the synthetic approach to CD-PEG-based dynamic covalent networks, 2) to understand their structure-property relationships, and 3) to examine their applications for carbon dioxide (CO2) separation and removal of hazardous chemicals from aqueous phases. CD-PEG-methacrylate conjugates having dynamic urethane bonds will be prepared first and then photocured to give the CD-PEG-based dynamic covalent networks.  Characterization and studies of physiochemical, mechanical and self-healing properties of the networks will be performed. Finally, membranes of CD-PEG-based covalent dynamic networks will be prepared for studies on CO2/N2 separation and removal of perfluorooctanoic acid, cholesterol, and uric acid from aqueous phase.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the effects of climate change on these protected habitats demands a reconsideration of whether or not this model is effective. Recent scholarship has suggested that the conservation methodology of rewilding ? the reintroduction or stabilization of wildlife populations as a way to restore ecosystems ? provides an alternative. Its emphasis on dispersing wildlife through corridors might provide species with greater flexibility to migrate within and between warming ecosystems. This research examines the implementation of rewilding projects to assess how the effects of climate change on wildlife habitats influence scientific practices on the ground. In addition to training a doctoral student in ethnographic methods and analysis, this research should provide evidence of how conservation scientists and practitioners confront the reality of changing climates in their efforts to prevent extirpation and extinction. Research findings will be shared with conservation organizations (non-governmental and governmental) and will be published in both academic and non-academic avenues in order to raise public awareness regarding the seriousness of climate change for threatened wildlife.   <br/><br/>The central question of this project asks whether, how, and why climate change informs stakeholder responses to and decisions about wildlife conservation. To answer this, research will be conducted among several groups of stakeholders including conservation philanthropists, scientists, state officials, and local communities. By integrating perspectives from actors involved in or affected by rewilding projects, this research tests for the cultural, economic, scientific, and/or political concerns that guide conservation decision-making. This research brings together frameworks from Science Studies and political ecology to provide new theoretical insights into how recourse to scientific expertise, political power, and economic influence inflects climate change responses. Through employing ethnographic methods like participant observation and in-depth interviews, this project demonstrates the importance of anthropological investigation in climate change research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The planned research will provide foundational understanding of lung function including respiration, circulation, and immunity, at the cellular level and in real-time. Understanding the lung function (and dysfunction) at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution will address key challenges in the emerging fields of lung mechanobiology and mechano-immunity. The focus on multidisciplinary and multiscale approaches, both experimental and mathematical, will also provide exciting opportunities for students on all levels to participate in the unexplored area of pulmonary biomechanics and mechanobiology.

Such observations reveal the presence of differentially rotating fluid atmospheres with embedded features in the form of large-scale eddies and jets that greatly influence the climate on the celestial body. On Earth the impact of the high latitude jet stream on weather and the destructive impact of hurricanes due to climate change is evident. Within the Jovian atmosphere, the recent discovery by the Juno mission of polar vortices illuminates the longevity of vortical structures. Theory, experimentation, and numerical simulations strongly suggest that the generation of large-scale jets and vortices is common in fluid turbulence within thin layers like the Earth?s atmosphere and on rapidly rotating celestial bodies such as Jupiter. Focusing on these paradigms, this project is dedicated to elucidating the basic mechanism behind the formation of such large-scale structures from small-scale turbulent fluctuations and its disruption via the generation of isolated, weakly-interacting, mesoscale shielded vortices, and to extending this understanding to more realistic models that introduce higher level physics such as the effects of water vapor and internal heating via latent heat release. This understanding will inform more detailed studies such as those based on realistic Global Ocean and Atmospheric Circulation Models and offers hope for understanding the conditions favoring the formation of both large-scale structures and of the smaller-scale shielded vortices. The modeling strategy taken provides a foundation upon which greater discipline-specific complexity can be built. The project will support and train one graduate student and one postdoctoral researcher in the physical understanding of energy transfer between scales in systems of geophysical relevance, asymptotic and other modeling techniques, as well as direct numerical simulations of rapidly rotating fluid layers, appropriate for planetary-scale phenomena on and within the Earth.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to classify different regimes of instability-driven turbulence in two dimensions (2D) as a function of the energy input and dissipation parameters, and to explore how these states evolve when three-dimensional (3D) fluctuations become increasingly important as the height of the turbulent layer increases. Particular emphasis will be placed on the recently discovered regime of shielded mesoscale vortices whose generation may disrupt the inverse energy cascade familiar from 2D turbulence with random stirring. Properties of the resulting chiral mesoscale vortex gas will be studied as a function of the layer height, as will the transition to a vortex crystal that takes place at high vortex density in 2D. The Reynolds number will be varied systematically to bridge the gap between these phenomena and related states in bacterial suspensions at low Reynolds numbers. The possibility of an analogous state in rapidly rotating 3D turbulence will be investigated in detail using a new reformulation of the Navier-Stokes fluid equations, extending direct numerical simulations to smaller Rossby numbers, together with a theoretical analysis dissecting the amplitude-phase relationships between large-scale structures and small-scale turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Castle of Brigham Young University is developing new reaction methodology for synthesizing organic molecules. These reactions are triggered by thermal energy (i.e., microwave irradiation or conventional heating) and do not require the addition of external catalysts. The advantages of this approach when compared to other, more conventional strategies to similar entities include its simplicity, the lack of expensive or extravagant reagents or catalysts, the scope of the molecules that can be subjected to and generated from this chemistry, and the relatively short reaction times that are required for initiation and product formation. As a result, these new methods provide efficient synthetic routes to important classes of compounds, including some with potential as pharmaceuticals. In addition to developing the chemistry, Professor Castle and his students plan to advance STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education by creating lesson plans that will help high school chemistry teachers to incorporate organic chemistry into their courses. By exposing students to organic and medicinal chemistry far sooner than they normally would be, it is hoped that high school students will develop a deeper appreciation for chemistry and this has the potential to encourage them to consider pursuing STEM pathways in their education and professionally. The students that are directly participating in this project are receiving training in experimental techniques, troubleshooting chemical reactoins, communication, and critical thinking that will provide them with valuable tools to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Steven Castle and his research group will generate iminyl radicals under thermal conditions by inducing the homolytic cleavage of relatively weak N-O bonds that are present in readily available O-aryl oxime ethers. This process affords high energy iminyl radicals that are capable of undergoing a variety of chemical transformations including intramolecular processes. These include cyclization reactions with pendant alkenes and hydrogen atom abstraction reactions with hydrogens that are a prescribed distance from the iminyl nitrogen atom. The radicals are also capable of being trapped intermolecularly to forge new C-C, C-N, C-O, C-S, or C-X (X = halogen) bonds. In addition to studying the fundamental generation and reactivity of iminyl radicals, the utility of this methodology is to be demonstrated through the planned convergent synthesis of fortuneicyclidin, with iminyl radical cyclization being the key step.  This architecturally novel alkaloid natural product has yet to be synthesized in the laboratory and the proposed route has the potential to demonstrate real utility of the proposed iminyl radical-based tandem cyclization chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tensegrity represents a class of structures composed of members in compression and tension in a self-equilibrated state. In this project, tensegrity systems are studied to conceive rapidly erected structures for traditional civil applications. However, the outcomes of this award extend beyond architecture and structures as tensegrity systems have been explored for a wide variety of engineering applications including metamaterials, planetary landers, soft robotics, as well as to model the mechanical behavior of biological cells. Although tensegrity structures have received significant interest among scientists and engineers, there is still no unifying theory on their generation and behavior. This research project thus seeks to develop a morphological framework that integrates design criteria with assembly and kinematics while providing architectural design freedom. The framework enables control over the behavior of tensegrity structures by decomposing complex systems into elementary tensegrity units. Inspired by tensegrity?s artistic origin, the research will also be complemented by developing learning modules centered on objects at the intersection of art, science, and engineering, exploring object-based learning in collaboration with educational experts and students.<br/><br/>The goal of the research project is to develop a theoretical understanding of how morphology can be used to define the stability, equilibrium, deployability, structural response, sensing, and control in complex tensegrity structures.

To accomplish these objectives, a method that links topology identification and form finding through the cellular composition of tensegrity systems with cells being elementary tensegrity units will be explored. It is hypothesized that tuning the cellular composition of tensegrity structures along with their structural parameters can lead to desired shapes, optimized mechanical performance, and advantageous control methods.

The project converges social science, data science, environmental science, and computer engineering through a traditional knowledge framework to identify key links between resilience and sovereignty of Indigenous communities.

Yet, only students who have access to expensive resources or see themselves as people who are good with technology due to many factors, including images in popular media, have opportunities to develop comfort and fluency in engineering and technology. Often, youth do not engage with engineering and technology because they feel like they do not ""belong"" in engineering. In this project, middle and high school youth will lead the design of spaces where different types of technologies (for example, 3d printers, laser and vinyl cutters, microcontroller boards, sensors and other electronics, sewing machines, and hand tools) will be used, by youth, to solve engineering problems relevant to them in a low-stakes environment. The spaces will be designed with two aims: 1) to support youth in developing a sense of belonging to the space and in engineering; and 2) to consider preventing harm to communities and the environment as central to their engineering problem-solving. The youth will also work with the research team to develop ways to introduce the idea of preventing harm to people and the environment as an essential tenet of engineering and develop best practices to create similar youth-led technology-rich spaces. The project will also bring together groups of coordinators who run such spaces and students who are or might become leaders in such spaces, to learn from them and support them in learning new ideas.<br/><br/>Using technology to create artifacts aligned with students? interests and motivations has great promise in attracting students to engineering. Still, many people do not benefit from such opportunities.  A lack of sense of belonging in engineering and STEM contexts plays a clear role, as do the inadvertent gatekeeping behaviors of teachers, shop staff, and coordinators. This project addresses these barriers by conducting youth participatory work to meet the unmet promises of technology-rich spaces in engineering education. The project has two primary goals: Goal 1: To support youth in leading explorations of how technology use and creation can support a sense of belonging in engineering. Goal 2: To develop a framework along with youth that centers preventing harm to people and the environment when engineering. For the research component of this project, the team will develop 1) best practices to promote belonging in technology-rich settings and an instrument to assess it, 2) a framework to center preventing harm in engineering design practices, and 3) best practices for youth to lead the development and maintenance of technology-rich engineering spaces. The educational plan of the proposal will focus on integrating research findings with an engineering design curriculum in a first-year engineering course and training and development programs for informal engineering educators and youth leaders. This work will significantly contribute to the PI?s long-term career vision to support a wide range of students in using engineering and technology to live lives of purpose and connection in an increasingly engineered world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metal nanoparticles provide unique electronic properties that form the basis of new medical treatments, manufacture of high value chemicals, and energy conversion processes.  However, there are currently limited means by which to control the underlying electronic properties and, thereby, control the efficiency and power of their use. The Lear research team is working to develop new chemical means to control and tune these electronic properties, utilizing the molecules often present at the surface of these particles. They focus on controlling the number of ways that electrons can be held on the metal. This fundamental property underpins familiar behaviors like electrical conduction, thermal conduction, and luster. Measuring the magnetic behavior of metal nanoparticles provides quantitative insight into this fundamental property. In addition to the technical impacts expected from this work, Dr. Lear and his students will be creating a website that provides clear design rules for communication through visualization of data. Because the preponderance of scientific communication relies on such visualizations, increasing the effectiveness and clarity of presentation will benefit fellow scientists, policy makers, and the general public.<br/><br/>Under this award, the research team led by Benjamin Lear at Pennsylvania State University seeks to develop a framework for ligand control over the electronic structure of metallic nanoparticles.  The underlying hypothesis is that the nature of the ligand-metal interface influences the position of the Fermi energy of the metal as well as the density of states at the Fermi energy. These properties are extracted from measurements of the Pauli paramagnetism of the particles and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. The team specifically seeks to understand how the influence of the ligands changes with binding mode, composition of the ligand layer, and size of the metallic nanoparticles.  The team also seeks to understand the nature of the coupling between metallic electronic states and ligand electronic states, using pulse EPR.  By systematically varying the ligands at nanoparticle surfaces, and measuring accompanying changes in magnetic properties, the Lear group is developing a framework that could enable other scientists and engineers to rationally control the behaviors of metal nanoparticles, increasing their utility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

City College) aim to create shape-shifting protein assemblies capable of responding to changes in relative humidity.  The research is inspired by phenomena observed in nature such as how pinecones and wheat are able to dispense their seeds. The team will develop protein polymers that mimic those found in nature, explore their water-responsive motion, and explore the mechanical power generated by the material. The work will investigate: 1) the role of structure in such protein polymers; 2) the effects of protein polymer composition on water-responsiveness; and 3)  how the nature of the molecular assembly leads to changes in their water-responsiveness. The ultimate goal is to achieve an understanding that will allow the team  to design new water responsive protein polymers assemblies that can efficiently convert motion into usable energy. This may lead to the development of high-power moving components for widespread applications such as robotics, shape-morphing and energy harvesting devices. This highly interdisciplinary research, involving protein engineering, chemical engineering and materials science, will provide training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. In collaborative outreach efforts, the team will hold an annual ?Biomimetic Technology? event that includes local New York City K-12 students and teachers to interact with state-of-the-art science to promote interest in science and increase public understanding of macromolecular science and engineering concepts.<br/><br/>Evaporation-induced shape change has proven to be an efficient mechanism for the conversion of energy from water?s chemical potential to mechanical energy. Owing to this property, water responsive (WR) materials can swell and shrink in response to relative humidity (RH) changes, and recent studies have shown that biological WR materials can generate significantly higher energy actuation than all known muscles and actuators. Here, the team will focus on creating shape-shifting protein engineered assemblies that fundamentally integrate nano-scaled structural features that can hierarchically assemble and lead to macroscale function of energy conversion from the chemical potential of water to mechanical motion. The team will investigate how supramolecular self-assembly and phase separation influence the WR properties of protein engineered block-copolypeptides (BCPs). To achieve this the team aims to investigate: 1) the role of structure in the engineered BCPs; 2) the effects of the surface blocks on BCP water-responsiveness; and 3) the effect of supramolecular structure with water-responsiveness. This fundamental understanding is expected to help the researchers develop a set of parameters to inform the design of biological WR actuators with high energy and power densities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The State of Idaho provides an excellent testbed for the project. This is due to the features of Idaho?s landscapes, which span a range of gradients (e.g., hydrologic, topographic, demographic, jurisdictional) and population densities (e.g., small rural towns and Native American communities to expanding urban areas). The results of the I-CREWS project will inform multisystemic resilience and E-W issues nationally. I-CREWS will be administered by the University of Idaho in collaboration with Boise State University, Idaho State University, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, and the Coeur d'Alene Tribe.  The I-CREWS project will grow research capacity with partner Tribal nations through a new Tribal Nations Research Network (TNRN), which will be developed to recenter knowledge exchange between Tribes and Idaho universities, focusing on collaboration through the development of tribally-originated research.  <br/><br/>The key research themes of I-CREWS are to: (1) characterize and evaluate E-W configurations for a continuum of resilience strategies; (2) model and represent E-W configurations and their resilience; and (3) develop alternative futures scenarios of E-W trajectories and their resilience to change. I-CREWS researchers will use socio-environmental-technological systems (SETS) typologies in their hypothesis that communities undergoing changes in their E-W systems can be characterized by SETS typologies at different scales to determine patterns of multisystemic resilience to climate-driven, demographic, and technological changes. I-CREWS researchers aim to determine whether the adoption of SETS interventions increases resilience and reduces vulnerability in E-W systems. The research will investigate the interaction of competing objectives (e.g., energy, water, resources, public use, local values) in a community-decision context. The I-CREWS project will engage partners across constituencies (scientists, land managers, policymakers, administrators, Tribal nations, and end users) in order to advance the integration of more comprehensive science with management and policy strategies for resilient stewardship and governance, thus providing locally-valued choices as well as capacity-building to achieve the project?s impacts.

Wildfire risk can be significantly reduced by three types of pre-event household hazard adjustments?mitigation, preparedness to stay, defend, and survive, and readiness to evacuate. However, the factors that influence the adoption of these hazard adjustments remain poorly understood. Existing wildfire evacuation models rarely consider fire spread dynamics; lack trilateral integration of people, fire hazard, and traffic components; and are based on limited social-behavioral data. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will integrate behavioral data with active learning and goal-setting techniques for increasing WUI residents? adoption of pre-event hazard adjustments. In addition, social-behavioral data will be infused into transportation engineering models to create more accurate and actionable agent-based models (ABMs) for evacuation. To achieve these objectives, the researchers will collaborate with four WUI communities in three states to (1) identify factors influencing households? pre-event hazard adjustment adoption and evacuation decision-making for wildfire hazard, and (2) integrate social-behavioral data into wildfire evacuation scenarios using ABMs to evaluate alternative evacuation strategies. Regional planners and emergency managers will be engaged to test and evaluate evacuation protocols and educational programs. <br/><br/>This project will expand and strengthen the capability of the Protection Action Decision Model (PADM) to explain complex decision-making processes related to wildfire mitigation, stay/defend/survive preparedness, and evacuation readiness. Specifically, this project?s results will advance our knowledge in pre-event risk messaging about wildfire hazards and address the urgent need for incorporating multidimensional datasets in wildfire evacuation models. The study of four different WUI communities will allow assessment of the cross-population generalizability within and beyond the project?s study areas. The outcomes will lead to best practices for motivating households? protective actions, assessments of community-informed evidence-based strategies for wildfire evacuation modeling, testing of alternative wildfire warning messaging strategies, and, ultimately, reduction in wildfire risk to residents and businesses.

Prior studies have consistently demonstrated numerous positive associations between family engagement and children?s learning, including minority students in urban areas, rural children, and across gender. Despite these positive findings, most of what is known is based on assessing the effects of family engagement (i.e., parent involvement and family-school partnerships) on children?s broad learning (e.g., general academic achievement). Large-scale reviews have paid little to no attention to how family engagement can specifically be used to support critical student STEM outcomes (e.g., STEM participation and motivation, math and science achievement). Further, little is known regarding how, for whom, and under what conditions family engagement interventions can be most effective.

It is of great importance to study fluctuations and large deviations from the typical or mean behavior of these systems. Indeed, fluctuations and atypical events, although rare, can have significant impact, so it is important to quantify these probabilities and to understand typical occurrences of rare events.  A significant mathematical challenge is to see how the structure of interaction between large collections of stochastic elements influences the nature of such deviations. This project will address this challenge for three classes of stochastic systems. The first class consists of large collections of interacting diffusions that arise as models of stock prices in finance, as continuum models of population dynamics in biology, and in statistical physics.  The second class concerns high-dimensional measures, such as random ensembles of matrices arising as representations of high-dimensional data, and their relation to lower-dimensional projections, which are used as a dimension-reduction technique when analyzing data.  Understanding the statistics and deviations of lower-dimensional projections is not only relevant for statistics and data science but also has significance for some open conjectures in convex geometry.  The third class pertains to the study of fluctuations of eigenvectors of random matrices and addresses hypotheses related to quantum mechanical systems. The project will include vertically integrated mentoring of junior researchers at multiple levels and outreach efforts to foster broadening the mathematical participation of underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. <br/><br/>This project will study high-dimensional stochastic systems and work to characterize fluctuations and large deviations from mean behavior and the nature of rare events in such systems. Three classes of problems will be considered. The first focuses on large collections of diffusions whose local interaction structure is governed by an underlying graph, and aims to study their atypical or large deviation behavior.  While this has been well understood for almost half a century in the case when the underlying graph is the complete graph, the goal of this project is to study the complementary case when the graphs are (uniformly) sparse, which is also the relevant regime for many applications. This will require a combination of tools from random graph theory, stochastic analysis and variational methods. The second class of problems relates to the study of concentration and large deviation behavior of projections of high-dimensional convex bodies, with a focus on non-commutative settings, such as the level sets of norms of Banach spaces of matrices such as the p-Schatten spaces. The relation to some outstanding conjectures in convex geometry will also be explored. The third theme concerns the study of universality of the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis from physics, which is a statement about eigenvectors of random matrices, and corresponding fluctuations.

This project also aims at the creation of a group of graduate and undergraduate students at Howard University working on the numerical analysis of the qualitative dynamics of the systems, together with the lead investigator. Moreover, within this project, the investigator will write a monograph on the logistic map, with help from participating students. This monograph will finally collect the most important results on the logistic map in a single place and will be aimed at applied readers, emphasizing readability over formal elegance.

Conventional antifreezing materials, such as icephobic water-free organics or hydrophilic hydrogels containing antifreezing additives, often suffer from weak mechanical properties under subzero temperatures, which limits their practical applications. To address this issue, this research will explore a design strategy for developing a new class of fully polymeric hydrogels that possess inherent antifreezing properties and enhanced mechanical strength without requiring antifreeze additives.  A successful project could pave the way for a new family of antifreezing hydrogels with diverse structures and other built-in functions for different applications under subzero temperatures, including flexible supercapacitors, soft robotics, electronic skin, and wearable devices. The research is multi-disciplinary and will provide a valuable learning experience for undergraduate/graduate students and high-school teachers in the areas of polymer chemistry/physics, molecular simulations, and engineering design. Additionally, the PI will also introduce experimental and computational components to the curriculum to enhance student learning of engineered materials and promote the field of hydrogel-based materials by organizing international conferences, special journal issues, and STEM student activities. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this research are twofold and aim to (1) develop and engineer a new family of fully polymeric hydrogels with intrinsic antifreezing and enhanced mechanical properties and (2) gain a fundamental understanding of antifreezing/toughening mechanisms of these hydrogels at different spatial and time scales ranging from atomic to macroscopic levels by using a combination of polymer chemistry and molecular simulations. The design strategy for these antifreezing hydrogels is to integrate strong water-binding polymers with tightly crosslinked and highly interpenetrating double-network structures, allowing to enhance polymer-water interactions for competitively inhibiting ice nucleation and growth, as well as to activate multiple energy-dissipation pathways for improving hydrogel mechanical properties. Parallel to experimental works, multiscale molecular simulations with new polymerization algorithms will be developed to study water structures, dynamics, and interactions around polymers confined in networks at both resting and stretching states, as well as at different subzero temperatures. Computational study allows to reveal different but correlated antifreezing and toughening mechanisms at atomic levels. Finally, experimental and computational data from the benchmarking hydrogel systems will be compared and correlated to better understand the complex composition/structure-dependent antifreezing and mechanical performance of such hydrogels. This will lead toward an optimal design of antifreezing hydrogels in an iterative way by investigating changes in polymer chemistries, pendant groups/crosslinkers, network structures, and water behavior. Overall, the development of new antifreezing hydrogels with enhanced properties could impact areas such as improved energy efficiency, environmental protection, biomedical treatments, and industrial applications.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The dust, and at least some of the gas, is generated through collisions between rocky bodies that range in size from tiny grains of sand to the scale of Pluto. This project will characterize the vertical structure of debris disks at radio wavelengths, measuring whether they are puffy (like a donut) or flat (like a pancake), to help us understand how planetary systems evolve. The vertical structure can tell us how common planets like Uranus and Neptune are around other stars. It can also tell us about how often Neptune-like planets migrate through their dusty disks, and it can provide clues to the amount and type of gas that is present during the last stages of planetary system evolution. Van Vleck Observatory?s public outreach program will be reinvigorated after the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both the research and public outreach components will allow deep involvement from students in Wesleyan?s existing masters and affiliated summer research programs, which are explicitly targeted at drawing students with non-traditional backgrounds into research astronomy.<br/><br/>The investigator and her students will use the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to image disks to reveal the distribution of gas and dust in fine detail, with multiple resolution elements across the vertical dimension of each system.

Aggrecan is found in cartilage tissue, and the degradation of aggrecan has been implicated in the onset and progression of the disease osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a disease that afflicts the joints, where the cartilage tissue in the joint is deteriorated leading to pain, inflammation, and dysfunction of the joint. This disease affects senior citizens in particular, and it is believed to affect 10% of the population over the age of 60 and costs the US economy over $60 billion dollars annually. Aggrecan mimetic polymers are seen as a promising approach to regenerative treatment for osteoarthritis. There are several challenges in developing treatments using aggrecan mimics that must be overcome. Key properties the candidate treatments must possess to overcome these challenges include injectability, biocompatibility, and immobility once in the treatment area.  This work will develop computational methods, using simulation and machine learning to design candidate polymers that possess the desired properties for use in cartilage treatment. This design framework can be further utilized to design materials for a variety of challenges in health and consumer products. The PI will work with their mentor and institution to broaden participation amongst underrepresented groups through an established training program for aspiring materials scientists as well as outreach activities aimed at providing community college students with guidance and exposure to STEM graduate education and research. These efforts of the PI to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM will also be informed by their past participation in diversity, equity and inclusion programs and past experiences as a community college student.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed work is to develop a computational model for designing aggrecan mimetic copolymers, that uses coarse-grained molecular simulations and machine learning methods, and is informed and validated by experimental data. The proposed copolymer will be made up of a thermoresponsive component and a charged component to effectively mimic the proteoglycan aggrecan, while achieving necessary material properties for use as an injection treatment. The candidate must be biocompatible, injectable, and once in the treatment area, and must remain immobile in the target tissue. The PI proposes a copolymer made with the biocompatible and charged polymer poly(sodium-4-styrene sulfonate) (PSSNa) and the thermoresponsive polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm). The goal is to design a copolymer that possesses the charge density of aggrecan and undergoes a sol-gel transition at physiological temperatures. The latter will ensure that the material is injectable at room temperature and is immobilized at body temperature in the treatment area. The PI will develop a coarse-grained model for the proposed copolymer, that will be parameterized and validated by experimental results provided by the collaborator on the proposed project. The PI will use the coarse-grained model in molecular dynamics simulations to model copolymers with a variety of copolymer design parameters, such as the copolymer architecture, sidechain grafting density, side chain length, and molecular weight. The simulation and experimental data will be used to develop a data-driven forward and inverse model that can predict optimal polymer design for desired solution behavior and polymer chain conformation properties. The simulation and data-driven models will be used to generate candidate materials to serve as potential injection treatments for restoring cartilage damaged by the progression of osteoarthritis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Yan Gong is ""Elucidating the Cellular and Molecular Dynamics behind Nectary Development in Aquilegia"" The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Elena M. Kramer.<br/><br/>Nectar is a central bridge between flowering plants and pollinators. The consumption of nectar and the subsequent transfer of pollen by pollinators are vital to the reproductive success of most flowering plants. Nearly 90% of all flowering plants and 76% of domestic crops benefit from such plant-pollinator interactions. Nectar is produced by nectaries, specialized cellular structures that are thought to have evolved multiple times independently. The evolution of nectaries significantly boosted genetic diversity, accelerated speciation, and expanded the habitats of these lineages. Despite nectaries' physiological, agricultural, and ecological importance, our understanding of nectary development is limited to a small subset of flowering plants. This project will address this challenge by investigating the genetic control behind nectary development in basal eudicot species of Aquilegia, with the hope of discovering genetic traits that can be engineered to reduce single pollinator dependence in crops, an urgent issue worsened by climate change. The Fellow will receive training in single-cell genomics, development, and evolutionary biology from this project. To facilitate scientific communication on this topic and promote community participation, the Fellow will organize a mini-symposium on this topic and mentor students performing scientific research. <br/><br/>This project focuses on physiologically, agriculturally, and ecologically important plant tissue - the nectary - and aims to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for nectary formation and nectar production. Specific aims are to 1) profile the nectary gene expression network by single-cell RNA sequencing and elucidate the genetic circuits underlying nectar production and secretion in Aquilegia; and 2) examine how different Aquilegia species adjust the nectar sugar composition to attract different pollinators. The combination of cutting-edge functional genomics methods and comparative evo-devo approaches will not only fill the gaps in our knowledge about the genetic basis of nectary development but also offer insights into the evolution of nectaries and their regulatory networks. The single-cell transcriptome datasets and plant genetic material generated from this project will be available to the public through various community resource-sharing websites. <br/><br/>Keywords: nectary development, plant-pollinator interactions, single-cell RNA sequencing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, a well-trained QIS workforce is necessary to make these advances. Unfortunately, QIS is a challenging, interdisciplinary field to learn. The goal of this project is to advance QIS education by using virtual reality (VR) and machine learning to adaptively address misconceptions about the field. The project will directly impact the education of approximately 120 undergraduate students learning QIS and has the potential to help transform how to motivate and prepare students for future quantum workforce positions.<br/><br/>This project will leverage QubitVR, a VR application previously developed for learning foundational QIS concepts like superposition, measurement, and entanglement. As a first aim, the project will identify and predict QIS misconceptions by collecting data from a controlled, general-population study of QubitVR. This aim will include the development and validation of a new QIS Concept Introductory Test (QISCIT) for assessing learning outcomes. It will also involve labeling misconceptions in the collected data and the development and systematic evaluation of machine learning models based on VR tracking and input data for predicting when QubitVR learners are likely to have a misconception. As a second aim, the project will adaptively tutor QIS misconceptions by developing two intelligent tutoring versions of QubitVR: one that employs proactive conceptual scaffolds based on the machine learning models and one that employs reactive scaffolds based on conventional action-condition rules-based reasoning. This aim will involve one of few studies to directly compare machine learning-based and rules-based approaches to intelligent tutoring by comparing the two versions in a between-subject, general-population study. As a third aim, the project will ecologically validate the efficacy of QubitVR by collecting control, baseline, and adaptive tutoring data from undergraduate QIS courses in a longitudinal study. As a final aim, the project will result in the development of desktop and smartphone versions of QubitVR, which will be made openly available alongside the VR versions for broader educational impacts and to advance QIS education beyond the scope of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most research on LAs has been conducted in a limited set of institutions and disciplines, calling for further research on LAs in new institutional contexts. This project will pilot and evaluate an LA program across the STEM curriculum at Azusa Pacific University, a 4-year HSI in Los Angeles County. The LA program is expected to improve retention and graduation rates for STEM majors, increasing the number of Hispanic/Latino students achieving STEM degrees, and to provide insight into factors that contribute to Hispanic/Latino students adopting a STEM identity.<br/><br/>This project uses mixed-methods research to answer the following questions: (1) Does the presence of an LA in the classroom help cultivate a sense of STEM identity amongst students, particularly for Hispanic or Latino students? (2) How does being an LA influence one?s identity/sense of belonging in STEM, particularly for Hispanic or Latino LAs? Interviews and focus group transcripts will be analyzed qualitatively by students and LAs. In addition, data will be analyzed quantitatively from the STEM Professional Identity Overlap 4 (STEM-PIO-4) measure and the STEM Career Interest Survey (STEM-CIS). Researchers expect to gain insights into culturally-specific instructional practices that can be used at HSIs to increase students? sense of STEM identity and retention of diverse students in STEM.

The research is inspired by phenomena observed in nature such as how pinecones and wheat are able to dispense their seeds. The team will develop protein polymers that mimic those found in nature, explore their water-responsive motion, and explore the mechanical power generated by the material. The work will investigate: 1) the role of structure in such protein polymers; 2) the effects of protein polymer composition on water-responsiveness; and 3)  how the nature of the molecular assembly leads to changes in their water-responsiveness. The ultimate goal is to achieve an understanding that will allow the team  to design new water responsive protein polymers assemblies that can efficiently convert motion into usable energy. This may lead to the development of high-power moving components for widespread applications such as robotics, shape-morphing and energy harvesting devices.

These reactions are important because they play a significant role in determining how environmental contaminants, such as toxic metals and hazardous organic compounds, behave in the environment and in water treatment systems. The project focuses on birnessite, which is a highly reactive manganese oxide commonly found in the environment. The rate at which birnessite transforms environmental contaminants present in water can depend on the properties of the birnessite and the water chemistry, but there is currently no quantitative method for determining why. To address this gap, the project will characterize the elemental composition, oxidation state, crystal structure, aggregation state, and surface charge of birnessite in various types of water and determine how quickly different environmental contaminants react with birnessite under the same conditions. To broaden the societal and scientific impact of the project, the researchers will also develop a workshop to teach other scientists and engineers how to use electrochemical methods to study minerals, and organize a demonstration called ?Mysterious Manganese Minerals? at an outreach event for grade 6-12 young women interested in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>This project will use a combination of mediated electrochemical techniques, spectroscopic analyses, and contaminant fate studies to thoroughly characterize birnessite and its reactivity.

If successful, this work will provide the environmental chemistry and geochemistry communities with a method for estimating the thermodynamic properties of birnessite under a range of solution chemistries.

In some contexts, the Langlands conjectures have been proven true, but there remain subtleties that are poorly understood. In other contexts, they are yet to even be precisely formulated. This project proposes to study the Langlands program within the context of geometric deformation. In addition to the number theory research goals, the project also includes a training component for educators: a three-week summer number theory program during each year of the project for high school teachers throughout Maine, especially those serving rural areas. As part of the program, educators will develop extracurricular activities or elective courses in number theory for their local high school. <br/><br/>The first research goal of the project is to make progress toward establishing the so-called local Langlands conjecture in families, which upgrades a presumed local Langlands correspondence to a map between moduli spaces of integral objects on either side of the correspondence, assuming a short list of desiderata. The second goal is to study the logical dependence between the local Langlands conjecture in families and the conjectures surrounding recent p-adic geometrizations of the local Langlands conjectures. The method is to generalize converse theorems and the Plancherel measure in families in order to extend a line of argument previously used in the special cases of general linear groups and classical groups. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms by understanding their variational structure, and by doing so will develop novel mathematical techniques. Graduate and undergraduate students will also be trained as part of this project. <br/><br/>This award focuses on two classes of anisotropic, non-local variational problems that have arisen in data science tasks. The first is a data-adapted, non-local perimeter which appears naturally in the context of adversarial learning, and the second is a non-local Dirichlet energy used in graph-based learning methods. This work will deepen our understanding of the regularity associated with these energies and corresponding evolution equations and will provide a new avenue for understanding classical elliptic regularity theory. Doing so will improve upon the current work in the machine learning community on the theory of these algorithms, helping to aid in rigorous choices for interpretable and computationally efficient algorithm design. Finally, the expected results will expand the types of tasks and questions that are computationally tractable, for example by permitting efficient exploration of the effect of adversarial power and its effect on topology and accuracy, or by permitting the accurate inclusion of boundary constraints in non-local Laplacian problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wildfire risk can be significantly reduced by three types of pre-event household hazard adjustments?mitigation, preparedness to stay, defend, and survive, and readiness to evacuate. However, the factors that influence the adoption of these hazard adjustments remain poorly understood. Existing wildfire evacuation models rarely consider fire spread dynamics; lack trilateral integration of people, fire hazard, and traffic components; and are based on limited social-behavioral data. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will integrate behavioral data with active learning and goal-setting techniques for increasing WUI residents? adoption of pre-event hazard adjustments. In addition, social-behavioral data will be infused into transportation engineering models to create more accurate and actionable agent-based models (ABMs) for evacuation. To achieve these objectives, the researchers will collaborate with four WUI communities in three states to (1) identify factors influencing households? pre-event hazard adjustment adoption and evacuation decision-making for wildfire hazard, and (2) integrate social-behavioral data into wildfire evacuation scenarios using ABMs to evaluate alternative evacuation strategies. Regional planners and emergency managers will be engaged to test and evaluate evacuation protocols and educational programs. <br/><br/>This project will expand and strengthen the capability of the Protection Action Decision Model (PADM) to explain complex decision-making processes related to wildfire mitigation, stay/defend/survive preparedness, and evacuation readiness. Specifically, this project?s results will advance our knowledge in pre-event risk messaging about wildfire hazards and address the urgent need for incorporating multidimensional datasets in wildfire evacuation models. The study of four different WUI communities will allow assessment of the cross-population generalizability within and beyond the project?s study areas. The outcomes will lead to best practices for motivating households? protective actions, assessments of community-informed evidence-based strategies for wildfire evacuation modeling, testing of alternative wildfire warning messaging strategies, and, ultimately, reduction in wildfire risk to residents and businesses. The diverse project team includes early-career scientists, students, and researchers from underrepresented groups.

This project aims to develop mathematical models and numerical algorithms for the solidification process in the mushy zone. The numerical results will advance the understanding on the complex physical processes in the mushy zone and provide guidance to the design of alloys with desirable properties.

However, the addition of chlorine to wastewater also results in the production of unintended chemical byproducts that may be toxic. This project will characterize the reaction of chlorine with alcohols, such as methanol (wood alcohol) and ethanol, which are present in wastewater, to produce aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, reactive compounds that can have deleterious biological properties, particularly in adducting biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins.  Understanding the chemistry of aldehyde production from alcohols and chlorine is important to minimize the formation of these chemicals during wastewater treatment. In the face of climate change and drought, communities across the United States lack reliable sources of drinking water. Re-using wastewater (sewage) is an option to increase water supply in areas facing water stress. Wastewater reuse involves many treatment steps to ensure the water is safe to drink. Undergraduate researchers from both institutions will contribute to the work and inform the scientific community about the project findings through social media.<br/><br/>During wastewater reuse, oxidation with ozone or chlorine to inactivate pathogens and transform chemical contaminants can form toxic low molecular weight compounds including aldehydes. While aldehyde generation from ozonation of wastewater is well understood, the kinetics, mechanism of formation, and potential precursors during chlorination are largely unknown. This project will investigate the formation of aldehydes from the chlorination of an overlooked group of precursors: alcohols. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that methanol can be oxidized to formaldehyde by chlorine under conditions relevant to water treatment. Alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are frequently used as a supplemental carbon source during conventional wastewater treatment, and are likely present in water reuse operations. Additionally, alcohols are routinely used in environmental chemical research for stock solution preparation under the assumption that they are inert with respect to chlorine. The goals of this project include determining the kinetics, products, and mechanism of aqueous alcohol oxidation by chlorine, the development of a new method for quantifying trace alcohols in complex aqueous matrices, and its application to quantify alcohols in wastewater effluent and their contribution to observed aldehyde formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the nature of their packaging and release, these vesicles can contain molecules that are characteristic of their cells of origin. This means that exosomes can carry biomarkers for various disease states, including cancer and Alzheimer?s disease. However, current methods for isolating and purifying exosomes are costly and often ineffective. Developing new ways to control the release of exosome contents is essential to engineer better diagnostic tests. This project will investigate a new set of knowledge and develop tools to control the behavior of exosomes through the application of heat. Students participating in this multidisciplinary research will be mentored and trained to prepare them for a successful career in STEM through summer research experiences, conferences, and hands-on lab experiences. <br/><br/>The goal of this Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Excellence in Research (HBCU-EiR) project is to develop and investigate the potential for engineering thermo-sensitive liposomes for applications in biosensing and downstream diagnostic applications. This will address a critical challenge in the field, which is to exert selective control over specific exosome populations within a mixed sample. More specifically, the ability to direct the release of a subset of exosomes from a capture substrate and to discharge their intra-vesicular cargo in a reliable and highly controlled manner could replace burdensome purification and isolation protocols and broaden the technological toolbox for integrated biosensors. Inspired by recent success in engineering stimuli-responsive liposomes, the investigators propose a new paradigm in the field of exosome research. Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that exosomes can be optimized to exhibit controllable behavior (e.g., release cargo) when exposed to an external stimulus (e.g., temperature). Ultimately, the project aims to define the criteria for achieving differential release in two distinct scenarios (1) from release of a 2D captured substrate and (2) from release of intra-exosomal contents (or target analytes). This will be accomplished via the following objectives: (1) Determine whether compositional differences in cell-derived model exosomes can be used to incite stimuli-responsive behavior; and (2) Engineer thermo-responsive exosomes by selective surface modification and validate their potential for biosensing applications. These outcomes are expected to advance and transform how exosomes and other extracellular vesicles are manipulated in many settings by introducing a new mechanism to control their behavior selectively. The relevance of this work additionally lies in the potential to define and test proof-of-concept criteria for other stimuli-responsive technologies, including light, enzymes, and acoustics. This will open pathways for opportunities to advance the quantification, monitoring, and detection of any targets bound in exosomes and capabilities with high relevance to the biosensing community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research plan leverages a discovery ? the intramolecular conductance isotope effect ? made under Professor Frisbie?s prior NSF support, which offers exciting opportunities to understand polaron transport mechanisms in much the same way the kinetic isotope effect is used in physical organic chemistry to understand the mechanisms of chemical reactions.  The project involves organic synthesis, structure characterization, conductance measurements and theoretical modeling.

Undergraduate students will be offered summer research experience. <br/><br/>The particular technical focus of this project is on understanding the nature of polarons, the de facto charge carriers in molecular semiconductors, including their size or delocalization length along pi-conjugated chains, their thermally activated motion, their hopping transition states, and the sensitivity of all these factors to molecular structure. The experimental approach focuses on the synthesis of pi-conjugated molecular wires up to 10 nm in length from gold surfaces.  The key innovation to the overall synthesis strategy will be the introduction of 13C and 15N isotopic labels to selected subunits of the wires.  The conductance of wires of length greater than 4-5 nm, where the charge transport mechanism is thermally-activated polaron-hopping, will then be measured using an established approach for making a second electrical contact to produce metal-molecule-metal junctions.

The project will advance this vision by building and integrating research capacity in biosciences and advanced manufacturing, two key areas identified as important to the State of Iowa. Chemurgy 2.0 will focus on the manufacturing of proteins, vaccines and therapeutics; the manufacturing of biochemicals and biofibers; 3D-printing and composite fabrication processes that utilize biochemicals and biofibers; and applications of data science and artificial intelligence. The development of plastics for additive manufacturing, fibers for flexible and rigid materials, and proteins for diagnostics and therapeutics will benefit society by providing bio-based and sustainable materials for health and consumer applications. With this project, research infrastructure will be improved not only at Iowa research universities but also at predominantly undergraduate institutions in Iowa.  Research experiences and educational opportunities will be provided for preservice teachers and for undergraduates from groups traditionally underrepresented ? including first-generation and rural students. Chemurgy 2.0 will be administered by Iowa State University in collaboration with the University of Iowa, the University of Northern Iowa, Dordt University, and Central College of Iowa.<br/><br/>The Chemurgy 2.0 research program will build capacity in meeting human needs from things that grow in three thematic areas: (1) Plastics for Additive Manufacturing (PAM), (2) Fibers for Flexible and Rigid materials (FFR), and (3) Proteins for Diagnostics and Therapeutics (PDT). The structure of each thematic area supports a ?discover? ? ?optimize? ? ?scale-up-to manufacture? pipeline that forms an iterative and interconnected loop spanning from the discovery of bio-inspired building blocks to manufacturing applications. PAM links the biomanufacturing of monomers to the Additive Manufacturing (AM) sector. FFR links biofibers to AM, textiles, and medical product manufacture. PDT focuses on larger bio-derived molecules, such as proteins and cell products, and connects them with diagnostics and therapeutics production. Data science is a cross-cutting theme throughout all focal areas. Overall, Chemurgy 2.0 addresses three intersecting problems: biomanufacturing, which is under-developed in Iowa relative to other sectors; the critical physical and cyberinfrastructure needs for biomanufacutring that are currently lacking; and workforce capacity, which is severely constrained in the state.   Chemurgy 2.0 is expected to increase research infrastructure and workforce in the basic and applied science and engineering fields related to biomanufacturing and digital industrial technologies.

CAT has emerged as a powerful assessment tool and has been applied to the field of educational testing, quality of life measurement, health related measurement, and testing in industrial settings. Different from the traditional paper-pencil test, CAT allows for personalized assessment. However, the application of CAT remains limited in small-scale assessment scenarios, such as in classrooms or business daily routines. This project will develop a series of statistical estimation methods, theories, algorithms, and software aimed at accelerating the development of CAT and promoting its applications in personalized educational assessment and learning. The project will address a fundamental challenge in educational research: the lack of efficient statistical methods to cope with limited samples sizes and missing data, especially in low-stakes assessment settings. The outcomes are expected to advance the fields of education and psychology and to positively impact society. The investigators will apply the new methods to educational data sets and develop publicly available software that will be directly applicable for educators and applied researchers. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the conduct of this research. <br/><br/>This research project will develop new statistical methods and theories to address the challenges of Item Response Theory (IRT) model calibration with small samples, sparse response data, and the lack of computationally efficient online estimation procedures with theoretical guarantee. The project will develop a dimension reduction method for a family of IRT models based on homogeneity structure learning, which belongs to a class of statistical and machine learning methods that aim to summarize useful information by discovering low-dimensional structures.  An online inference approach that borrows the wisdom of some recent developments in stochastic gradient descent based online estimation and inference also will be developed.  The investigators will validate these developed approaches through a set of simulation studies that mimic different aspects of small-scale assessments and analyze two real data sets from a computer-based classroom assessment and a large-scale CAT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nilsson of the University of Rochester, Cristiano Dias of the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), and Edward Egelman of the University of Virginia will study the supramolecular self-assembly of peptides into nanofibril biomaterials. Peptides are naturally occurring molecules found in all organisms that perform important biological functions, including acting as signaling hormones, including such bioactive peptides as insulin and oxytocin. Peptides can adopt different conformations that influence how they interact with each other. Beta-sheets are one common peptide structural motif. Peptides that assume beta-sheet conformations often rapidly self-assemble into nanofibrils. Some of these nanofibril assemblies are associated with protein misfolding disorders like Alzheimer?s disease and others have been designed to be functional biomaterials. In this work, the team will study how these peptides the co-assemble into these structures. Novel beta-sheet materials, ?rippled? beta-sheets, that are distinct from the ?pleated? beta-sheets found in nature, will be studied using experimental and computational techniques. These efforts will provide critical insight into the structure of both natural and artificial beta-sheets and the molecular-scale interactions that dictate the assembly of these materials. This research is directed at opening up new avenues for the design of next generation peptide-based nanomaterials. Outreach activity associated with this work includes an inquiry based mini-course on hydrogels called ?The Science of Slime? which will be conducted at the participating institutions for pre-university students from grades 7-12.  Additionally, the research teams will host high school interns for six weeks during the summer to provide mentoring and increase exposure to scientific research and to the chemical sciences, in general.<br/><br/>Under this award the collaborative Rochester, NJIT, Virginia team will investigate the supramolecular assembly of beta-sheet nanofibrils composed of mirror-image peptides by determining the structure of these systems with near-atomic precision and by using computer simulations to investigate the forces driving the formation of these assemblies.

In the first objective, cryo-electron microscopy will be used to elucidate the structure of related pleated and rippled beta-sheet assemblies and complementary computational analyses will be used to rationalize their mechanisms of assembly.  In the second objective, computational methods will be used to predict and design novel self-assembled beta-sheet peptide materials and these predictions will be tested experimentally. The results of the experiments will be used to validate and improve predictive computations.

However, when converting energy into an easily stored form, significant amount of energy is lost due to dissipations. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research on efficient dissipation of mechanical energy at low volume using smart elastomers. This project investigates internal movements in smart elastomers, such as liquid crystal elastomers (LCE), as new dissipation mechanisms that could significantly improve the performance of dampers. Understanding the deformation mechanisms of these LCEs will allow tailoring of the material properties to the desired application, such as energy harvesting, healthcare, and soft robotics. This research is integrated with a sustained educational and outreach activity aimed at developing a pipeline of girls and women in Mechanical Engineering, linking the results of the research program to soft robotics and coding initiation. Activities will focus on three objectives: introducing soft robotics, improving coding skills, and mentoring through research. These activities will increase women?s confidence, performance, and interest in pursuing an engineering career. <br/><br/>The project?s goal is to understand the dissipation deformation mechanisms in smart elastomers with intermolecular organization to design highly efficient composite dampers. The fundamental understanding of the dissipation mechanisms originating from the coupling between mesogens and polymer chains will help a comprehensive macroscopic modeling approach for the thermoviscoelastic behavior of LCEs, opening the door to robust device designs. This investigation will be carried out using combined experimental and numerical methods at multiple scales to determine and model the dissipative deformation mechanisms, the curing kinetics, and the damping in a LCE composite. New experimental methods will be developed to map the organization of the microstructure in LCEs to the deformation using depolarized Raman spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) will be used to study the evolution of a self-organizing microstructure during deformation. Additionally, the interactions between curing kinetics, crosslink density, and microstructure ordering are primordial to accurately predict properties of additively manufactured LCEs. Additionally, the potential for LCE composites to exhibit extreme damping at low cost will be explored.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Mechanics of Materials (MoMS) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emil Hernández-Pagán of the University of Delaware, Kristina Lilova of Arizona State University, and Robert Wexler of Washington University in St. Louis will investigate how the presence of halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide) influences the final arrangements of atoms (crystal structure) in the synthesis of certain classes of nanoparticles. The team will employ experimental techniques, including ones that provide information as the reaction occurs, and computational methods to gain in depth insight into this process. The particular crystal polymorph often dictates key properties of nanocrystalline materials and, consequently, the applications for which these can be used, for example, in photovoltaics, catalysis, and energy storage. Therefore, having the knowledge and ability to control the crystal structure is important. The broader impacts of this work are centered around (a) providing experimental and computational training to the students working on this project and (b) summer research experiences for undergraduate students from Puerto Rico that aim to complement the training they receive at their home institutions to better prepare them for the workforce and/or pursuing a graduate degree.  <br/><br/>The ability to rationally synthesize a given polymorph or phase of a nanoparticles is desirable as these dictate their mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. The proposed work synergistically combines experimental and computational methods to provide a holistic framework for a model system where halides drive the control of crystal structure/phase in the synthesis of manganese chalcogenide nanocrystals. This framework will encompass identifying pre-nucleation molecular species, performing thermochemical measurement of reaction and surface-ligand interactions, and monitoring the kinetics of nucleation and growth. A suite of in situ techniques will be employed to enable such measurements under the reaction conditions. Quantum-mechanics-based calculations will be used to identify atomic-scale interactions and the mechanisms that lead to the observed crystal structures/phases. These calculations will provide input for kinetic and thermodynamic models of nanocrystal nucleation and growth and, therefore, will produce multi-scale-based computational guidance for the controlled synthesis of metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. The studies will be extended to lanthanide chalcogenide nanocrystals, which have remained largely unexplored despite unique optical and magnetic properties. This work is anticipated to further increase the level of chemical understanding of the synthesis of Mn and Ln chalcogenide nanocrystals, and such insights have the potential to provide guidance to the scientific community for the synthesis of other classes of materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kulik has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to investigate the depositional history of a rare fossil-rich bonebed that preserves over 100 fossils of a dicynodont species allied with the mammalian lineage called Dolichuranus. Insights from this bonebed can provide a potential snapshot of what life was like for these extinct mammal-relatives from ~240 million years ago. For example, using the geology of the surrounding host rock, interpretations can be made to confirm or refute if this fossil assemblage represents a single population. Furthermore, insights from the microscopic details of fossilized bone tissue composition can be used to reconstruct the skeletal and histological changes that this species (and perhaps population) experienced during growth and development to large body size. Indeed, hard tissue histology- the study of dental and bone tissue microstructure and composition- provide the only insights to understand growth rates in the fossil record. To this end, the project goals are to characterize the depositional history of the bonebed in order to contextualize palaeobiological interpretations that can be understood from the fossilized remains that were recovered there, which can provide new information on social behavior, evolution of large body size, and population age structures in the deep evolutionary history of mammals. Broader impacts of this work include (1) working with the Field Museum of Natural History to disseminate results to a broad audience through a temporary exhibit in the Grainger Science Hub, (2) mentoring undergraduate and graduate students at Loyola University Chicago, and (3) developing a curriculum for college students focused on geochemical taphonomy and bone histology at Macalester College.<br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the depositional history of a dicynodont-dominated bonebed using traditional and geochemical taphonomic approaches. This bonebed is the lowermost occurrence in a stratigraphic succession of fossil localities in the Lifua Member of Tanzania that will be used to assess the degree of temporal and spatial reworking of vertebrate remains in fluvial and floodplain deposits. In addition, this project aims to test whether morphology, size, and age are correlated in the large dicynodont species, novel work that has not yet been done due to the scarcity of mix-aged dicynodont assemblages. Preliminary geochemical and traditional taphonomic results suggest that the dicynodont bonebed preserves a homogenous taphonomic history reflective of a single, rapid burial, but a larger sample is needed to validate that this bonebed is a snapshot of a single population. Through independent lines of evidence including sedimentology, petrography, bioclast preservation, trace-element analysis, and size-age assessment through hard tissue histology, this project will reconstruct the life history and preservational history of dicynodonts from this bonebed from microstructural to assemblage-wide scales. This novel combination of methods will establish a new line of inquiry in the long- studied question of mammalian social behavior and will also fill critical gaps in our understanding of growth and development in the most abundant group of Permo-Triassic stem-mammals to provide valuable comparative data to identify ontogenetic stages in dicynodonts more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the project is to be able to rapidly design, fabricate, and deploy a highly customized fleet of robots to respond to unique and urgent missions. These robots would be able to, for example, navigate small, winding spaces in cave systems or debris fields, as might be required for robotic search-and-rescue or exploration. The synergistic use of mechanical intelligence, embedded fluidic circuits, and flexible electronics will enable these new robot capabilities. Mechanical intelligence - the use of robot geometry and material properties to adapt to unexpected conditions - can significantly reduce the amount of computing capacity needed for the robot to accomplish its goals. Fluidic logic uses the movement of fluid in flexible channels within the robot body to convert signals from contact sensors and other external stimuli into commands that turn robot actuators on and off. Fluidic logic can be directly built into the robot body and bend and twist without losing function. Finally, communication and control functions that are best performed electronically will be implemented using flexible and stretchable electronics with a high tolerance for dynamic deformation. The resulting robots will be able to implement sophisticated functionality, while undertaking severe shape changes as needed, to traverse otherwise inaccessible spaces. Comprehensive educational activities incorporate and complement the research, including a new hands-on undergraduate course on printable robotics, and an outreach program to public high schools in Worcester County. <br/><br/>This project will create robot architectures that can be quickly 3D printed using additive manufacturing techniques, to produce inexpensive robots that can crawl, jump, swim, and dive through confined spaces, and which can be rapidly customized to incorporate mission-specific details.

A new class of complementary fluidic logic gates and electro-fluidic memory elements will be developed from multi-stable flexing beam structures with integrated linear actuators and fluidic tubing. Flexible electronic circuits and electro-fluidic interconnects will be integrated into the robots using conductive inks and elastomers. The role of electronics will be minimized and limited to selecting fluidic functionalities, functionalizing fluidic sensors and actuators, and writing programs into fluidic memory. The program will deliver a comprehensive robot architecture for terrestrial, underwater, and amphibious robots, including designs, fabrication processes, modeling and control methodologies, and software. The project will maintain a continuously evolving robot component library and will seek to build a community of researchers and potential users by sponsoring a sequence of increasingly challenging benchmarking scenarios inspired by the Tham Luang cave rescue in Thailand in 2018.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By beating rhythmically, flagella and cilia move fluid in the local environment of cells. This biological function enables pulmonary mucus clearance in airways and the transport of ovums from the ovary to the uterus for example. Malfunction of flagella and cilia can lead to a group of serious human disorders, ciliopathies, which cause a heavy economic and disease burden on society. However, despite the ubiquity and importance of flagella and cilia, fundamental biomechanics underlying the fluid transport of beating flagella and cilia are still poorly understood. Particularly, the detailed flow field induced by beating flagella and cilia remains unresolved. Combining state-of-the-art microscopy techniques with data-driven machine learning, the research team aims to address this difficult biomechanical problem. This research will investigate the flow field of healthy flagella as well as those of mutant flagella associated with ciliopathies using synergistic experimental and numerical modeling efforts. A potential solution to remedy the flow deficiency of malfunction flagella will be researched. In addition to the training and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, the project will produce appealing scientific videos and demonstrations to enhance the undergraduate curriculum and enrich outreach activities at the local communities of the two principal investigators.  <br/><br/>As a generic model for the morphology and dynamics of flagella and cilia, green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, will be studied in this research program.

It has been used to answer many questions, including detecting the presence or absence of animal species in an environment, evaluating animal behavior, and identifying ecological stressors and illegal activities. However, current uses are limited to the coverage of relatively small geographic areas with a fixed number of sensors. Animal-borne GPS-based location trackers paired with other sensors are another widely used tool in aiding wildlife conservation and ecosystem monitoring. Since capturing and collaring wild animals is a traumatic event for them, as well as being expensive and resource-intensive, multiyear deployments are required. There are severely limited opportunities to recharge batteries making relatively power-hungry sensing, such as acoustic monitoring, out of reach for existing tracking collars. The aim of the A3EM project is to devise an animal-borne adaptive acoustic monitoring system to enable long-term, real-time observation of the environment and behavior of wildlife. Animal-borne acoustic monitoring will be a novel tool that may provide new insights into biodiversity loss, a severe but underappreciated problem of our time. Combining acoustic monitoring with location tracking collars will enable entirely new applications that will facilitate census gathering and monitoring of threatened and endangered species, detecting poachers of elephants in Africa or caribou in Alaska, and evaluating the effects of mining and logging on wildlife, among many others. All data, hardware designs, and software source code will be released to the public domain, enabling tracking collar manufacturers to include the technology within their products.<br/><br/>A3EM constitutes a complex cyber-physical architecture involving humans, animals, distributed sensing devices, intelligent environmental monitoring agents, and limited power and network connectivity. This intermittently connected CPS, with a power budget an order of magnitude lower than typical, calls for novel approaches with a high level of autonomy and adaptation to the physical environment. A3EM will employ a unique combination of supervised and semi-supervised embedded machine learning to identify new and unexplored event classes in a given environment, dynamically control and adjust parameters related to data acquisition and storage, opportunistically share knowledge and data between distributed sensing devices, and optimize the management of storage and communication to minimize resource needs. These methods will be evaluated through the creation of a wearable acoustic monitoring system used to support ecological applications such as enhanced wildlife protection, rare species identification, and human impact studies on animal behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is known that identical chemical reactions will never produce the same products at the same times ? there will be always some distributions of completion times. Similarly, genetically identical biological cells under the same conditions will never have the same numbers of relevant biological molecules (proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, etc.). The origin of such divergence is the reality that chemical and biological processes have a random nature and occur in fluctuating environments.  Current quantitative analysis of chemical and biological processes, however, neglects the possibility of such variations in properties, mostly due to the lack of proper theoretical methods. Professor Kolomeisky will explore the hypothesis that the divergence in chemical properties not only can be fully accounted for but  also might be used as a powerful tool in probing the microscopic mechanisms of underlying chemical and biological processes. Professor Kolomeisky will provide opportunities for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to participate in this research and to gain valuable training and experience for their future careers. Outreach activities will also include the presentation of chemical shows in local schools, co-organization of an undergraduate chemistry research symposium, public lectures, and continued collaboration with science writers in order to disseminate the obtained knowledge to a general public. The broader impacts of this project will include a multidisciplinary training program for young researchers of different levels that will prepare them better for future technological and industrial challenges.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Anatoly Kolomeisky and his research group aim to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand the role of heterogeneity in chemical and biological processes by generating quantitative models for several specific phenomena.

Obtained theoretical results and predictions will be compared with experimental observations to modify and improve theoretical models. Specific projects will include: (i) investigation of the mechanisms of catalysis by analyzing dynamics of chemical reactions; (ii) understanding and optimizing the function of antimicrobial peptides; (iii) studying the role of heterogeneity in the dynamics of cancer initiation; and (iv) investigating mechanisms of cell lysis.  The strategy will be to build simple yet quantitative analytical models that are consistent with all experimental data, clarify the molecular picture of underlying processes, provide clear testable predictions for future experiments, all the while not violating basic laws of chemistry and physics.

By including the considerations of manufacturing processes in the early stages of design, designers can make effective decisions to customize material microstructures and achieve desired product performance, as envisioned by Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME). Current materials design methods focus on sequentially exploring model-based relations of materials and products at individual levels instead of a concurrent realization of products, materials, and manufacturing within a holistic system. The holistic, systems-based, robust co-design approach envisioned in this project will account for the goals of and interactions between multilevel material systems involving the product and the manufacturing processes under uncertainty. The approach will enable designers to concurrently visualize and explore level-specific objectives, multilevel interactions, and sublevel analyses, thus enabling quantitative linkages in digital design to materials structure to manufacturing workflows. The project will promote the progress of science by strategically integrating knowledge and techniques from the fields of systems engineering, engineering design, and materials science to enable a fundamental understanding of the couplings between products, materials, and manufacturing processes. Additionally, by designing new curricula that embed Design for ICME topics and organizing a summer school on the associated tools, students and practitioners will be better prepared to address complex materials design challenges from a systems perspective.<br/><br/>This ERI project will establish foundational techniques for coupling multilevel modeling of hierarchically structured materials, products, and their manufacturing processes with multiobjective systems design strategies and uncertainty management. The research plan consists of two parts: (1) establish history-dependent, data-driven processing-structure-property-performance (PSPP) linkages; and (2) formulate a systems-based inverse co-design framework for exploring ranged sets of robust solutions across multiple levels by managing uncertainty and its propagation. The overall expected outcome is a novel systems-based multilevel framework for the inverse co-design of materials, products, and manufacturing processes in terms of robust decisions made by distributed stakeholders under uncertainty. The intellectual merit includes: (1) a fundamental understanding of the interdependent nature of multilevel materials, manufacturing processes, and product design decisions; (2) an efficient mathematical representation of material structure hierarchy to realize products; and (3) a computational framework for the multilevel robust co-design visualization and exploration of the interactions between the different engineering disciplines (design, material, and manufacturing) in the early stages of design. Four related educational and outreach activities are planned to integrate the research with the broader community of students and professionals: (1) formalize the data-driven PSPP linkage modeling procedure by integrating the results in existing graduate courses; (2) iterate, update, and disseminate a systems-based design approach for standard ICME problems through a new Design for ICME course; (3) organize a one-week online summer school on tools relevant to Design for ICME; and (4) broadly disseminate results through scientific publications, presentations, and research monographs. These activities will lead to new verified and validated techniques to teach Design for ICME; new test examples to iterate, assess, and establish the generic utility of the constructs (individually and integrated); and a foundation for infusing multilevel materials modeling, manufacturing considerations, and decision-based design strategies into ICME workflows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From a geometric / topological viewpoint, they are one-dimensional objects.   The pursuit of a higher-dimensional theory of many graph theoretic concepts has been a fruitful area of research.  In the last half century, the introduction of the probabilistic method has had a tremendous impact on this area, and the study of randomness will be central to this project.  This project will focus on developing a high-dimensional version of graph embeddings and decompositions. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained as part of this project.<br/><br/>The primary focus of this proposal is embeddings in and decompositions of graphs and hypergraphs, with a particular emphasis on problems in ?high-dimensional combinatorics?. Hypergraph embeddings and decompositions are a central concern in modern combinatorics but also include some of the oldest combinatorial problems. For example, the famous ?Knights Tour? problem, studied in the 9th century, and the ?Icosian Game? of the 1800s, are both embedding problems. Both can be understood as the problem of finding a Hamilton cycle in a particular graph. Some of the most famous and influential combinatorial questions from the eighteenth and nineteenth century on Latin squares and combinatorial designs are now understood as hypergraph decomposition problems. Goals of this project include (1) using randomness to prove new embedding and decomposition results (2) proving ""robust"" versions of these results using the recently introduced notion of ""spreadness"" and (3) investigating statistical aspects of random combinatorial designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wildfire risk can be significantly reduced by three types of pre-event household hazard adjustments?mitigation, preparedness to stay, defend, and survive, and readiness to evacuate. However, the factors that influence the adoption of these hazard adjustments remain poorly understood. Existing wildfire evacuation models rarely consider fire spread dynamics; lack trilateral integration of people, fire hazard, and traffic components; and are based on limited social-behavioral data. To address these knowledge gaps, this project will integrate behavioral data with active learning and goal-setting techniques for increasing WUI residents? adoption of pre-event hazard adjustments. In addition, social-behavioral data will be infused into transportation engineering models to create more accurate and actionable agent-based models (ABMs) for evacuation. To achieve these objectives, the researchers will collaborate with four WUI communities in three states to (1) identify factors influencing households? pre-event hazard adjustment adoption and evacuation decision-making for wildfire hazard, and (2) integrate social-behavioral data into wildfire evacuation scenarios using ABMs to evaluate alternative evacuation strategies. Regional planners and emergency managers will be engaged to test and evaluate evacuation protocols and educational programs. <br/><br/>This project will expand and strengthen the capability of the Protection Action Decision Model (PADM) to explain complex decision-making processes related to wildfire mitigation, stay/defend/survive preparedness, and evacuation readiness. Specifically, this project?s results will advance our knowledge in pre-event risk messaging about wildfire hazards and address the urgent need for incorporating multidimensional datasets in wildfire evacuation models. The study of four different WUI communities will allow assessment of the cross-population generalizability within and beyond the project?s study areas. The outcomes will lead to best practices for motivating households? protective actions, assessments of community-informed evidence-based strategies for wildfire evacuation modeling, testing of alternative wildfire warning messaging strategies, and, ultimately, reduction in wildfire risk to residents and businesses. The diverse project team includes early-career scientists, students, and researchers from underrepresented groups. The project will build upon previous collaborations with community stakeholders to co-produce and share knowledge throughout the research process, ensuring that the work will promote data-driven policies and resource allocation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emil Hernández-Pagán of the University of Delaware, Kristina Lilova of Arizona State University, and Robert Wexler of Washington University in St. Louis will investigate how the presence of halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide) influences the final arrangements of atoms (crystal structure) in the synthesis of certain classes of nanoparticles. The team will employ experimental techniques, including ones that provide information as the reaction occurs, and computational methods to gain in depth insight into this process. The particular crystal polymorph often dictates key properties of nanocrystalline materials and, consequently, the applications for which these can be used, for example, in photovoltaics, catalysis, and energy storage. Therefore, having the knowledge and ability to control the crystal structure is important. The broader impacts of this work are centered around (a) providing experimental and computational training to the students working on this project and (b) summer research experiences for undergraduate students from Puerto Rico that aim to complement the training they receive at their home institutions to better prepare them for the workforce and/or pursuing a graduate degree.  <br/><br/>The ability to rationally synthesize a given polymorph or phase of a nanoparticles is desirable as these dictate their mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. The proposed work synergistically combines experimental and computational methods to provide a holistic framework for a model system where halides drive the control of crystal structure/phase in the synthesis of manganese chalcogenide nanocrystals. This framework will encompass identifying pre-nucleation molecular species, performing thermochemical measurement of reaction and surface-ligand interactions, and monitoring the kinetics of nucleation and growth. A suite of in situ techniques will be employed to enable such measurements under the reaction conditions. Quantum-mechanics-based calculations will be used to identify atomic-scale interactions and the mechanisms that lead to the observed crystal structures/phases. These calculations will provide input for kinetic and thermodynamic models of nanocrystal nucleation and growth and, therefore, will produce multi-scale-based computational guidance for the controlled synthesis of metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. The studies will be extended to lanthanide chalcogenide nanocrystals, which have remained largely unexplored despite unique optical and magnetic properties. This work is anticipated to further increase the level of chemical understanding of the synthesis of Mn and Ln chalcogenide nanocrystals, and such insights have the potential to provide guidance to the scientific community for the synthesis of other classes of materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nilsson of the University of Rochester, Cristiano Dias of the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), and Edward Egelman of the University of Virginia will study the supramolecular self-assembly of peptides into nanofibril biomaterials. Peptides are naturally occurring molecules found in all organisms that perform important biological functions, including acting as signaling hormones, including such bioactive peptides as insulin and oxytocin. Peptides can adopt different conformations that influence how they interact with each other. Beta-sheets are one common peptide structural motif. Peptides that assume beta-sheet conformations often rapidly self-assemble into nanofibrils. Some of these nanofibril assemblies are associated with protein misfolding disorders like Alzheimer?s disease and others have been designed to be functional biomaterials. In this work, the team will study how these peptides the co-assemble into these structures. Novel beta-sheet materials, ?rippled? beta-sheets, that are distinct from the ?pleated? beta-sheets found in nature, will be studied using experimental and computational techniques. These efforts will provide critical insight into the structure of both natural and artificial beta-sheets and the molecular-scale interactions that dictate the assembly of these materials. This research is directed at opening up new avenues for the design of next generation peptide-based nanomaterials. Outreach activity associated with this work includes an inquiry based mini-course on hydrogels called ?The Science of Slime? which will be conducted at the participating institutions for pre-university students from grades 7-12.  Additionally, the research teams will host high school interns for six weeks during the summer to provide mentoring and increase exposure to scientific research and to the chemical sciences, in general.<br/><br/>Under this award the collaborative Rochester, NJIT, Virginia team will investigate the supramolecular assembly of beta-sheet nanofibrils composed of mirror-image peptides by determining the structure of these systems with near-atomic precision and by using computer simulations to investigate the forces driving the formation of these assemblies.

In the first objective, cryo-electron microscopy will be used to elucidate the structure of related pleated and rippled beta-sheet assemblies and complementary computational analyses will be used to rationalize their mechanisms of assembly.  In the second objective, computational methods will be used to predict and design novel self-assembled beta-sheet peptide materials and these predictions will be tested experimentally. The results of the experiments will be used to validate and improve predictive computations.

Ober of Cornell University will prepare and study model polymer brushes with carefully tailored capture-release properties. Polymer brushes are surface coatings made by growing individual polymer macromolecules from a surface and possess properties that can change over only a few nanometers from glass-like (a hard substrate) to tissue like (a soft, wet surface). Brushes make ideal materials as sampling systems for biological or environmental applications due to their large surface area. By capturing a target molecule we will concentrate to detect even small amounts of a chemical or biomolecule, and then once done, trigger release of the captured targets to enable reuse of our device.  The goal is to understand the capture-release process to make resuable and more efficient sampling and detection systems. Characterization of these brush surfaces will include study of the capture-release mechanism as a function of brush architecture and binding site location and spacing on these new brushes. In these studies scientists in Germany and the United Kingdom will aid in characterizing the process and structure of these active polymer brushes. This work will offer a substantial training opportunity for students in Ithaca, New York that represents a cross-pollination between polymer chemistry and materials science while enabling them to take part in international collaborations and exchanges. Undergraduate researchers will work with the exchange partners to make and to study these materials. Outreach activities will include demonstrations designed for and made to high school teachers in teacher workshops of the value of nanochemistry in environmental and biological studies. <br/><br/>This research is focused on the preparation and study of capture-release coil polymer brushes that have varying levels of binding sites with selected spacing along the backbone and in different positions of the side. Controlled radical polymerization will be used to create tailored narrow dispersity brushes in a single strand or bottle brush architecture based on acrylamide and styrene-maleimide polymers and peptoid precision synthesis will be employed to make brush side arms that enable precise placement of active sites. Alternating copolymerization will also space out binding sites and associated packing stress along the backbone and spacers will separate those sites from the backbone, both intended to maximize packing potential and control binding site distribution in the brushes. Different brush designs will be tested for capture-release applications through our Freiburg collaborators. Advanced characterization of the brushes will be made using analytical methods ranging from neutron reflectivity and GISAXS to fluorescence and QCM studies of brushes exposed to different binding systems.

Such observations reveal the presence of differentially rotating fluid atmospheres with embedded features in the form of large-scale eddies and jets that greatly influence the climate on the celestial body. On Earth the impact of the high latitude jet stream on weather and the destructive impact of hurricanes due to climate change is evident. Within the Jovian atmosphere, the recent discovery by the Juno mission of polar vortices illuminates the longevity of vortical structures. Theory, experimentation, and numerical simulations strongly suggest that the generation of large-scale jets and vortices is common in fluid turbulence within thin layers like the Earth?s atmosphere and on rapidly rotating celestial bodies such as Jupiter. Focusing on these paradigms, this project is dedicated to elucidating the basic mechanism behind the formation of such large-scale structures from small-scale turbulent fluctuations and its disruption via the generation of isolated, weakly-interacting, mesoscale shielded vortices, and to extending this understanding to more realistic models that introduce higher level physics such as the effects of water vapor and internal heating via latent heat release. This understanding will inform more detailed studies such as those based on realistic Global Ocean and Atmospheric Circulation Models and offers hope for understanding the conditions favoring the formation of both large-scale structures and of the smaller-scale shielded vortices. The modeling strategy taken provides a foundation upon which greater discipline-specific complexity can be built. The project will support and train one graduate student and one postdoctoral researcher in the physical understanding of energy transfer between scales in systems of geophysical relevance, asymptotic and other modeling techniques, as well as direct numerical simulations of rapidly rotating fluid layers, appropriate for planetary-scale phenomena on and within the Earth.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to classify different regimes of instability-driven turbulence in two dimensions (2D) as a function of the energy input and dissipation parameters, and to explore how these states evolve when three-dimensional (3D) fluctuations become increasingly important as the height of the turbulent layer increases. Particular emphasis will be placed on the recently discovered regime of shielded mesoscale vortices whose generation may disrupt the inverse energy cascade familiar from 2D turbulence with random stirring. Properties of the resulting chiral mesoscale vortex gas will be studied as a function of the layer height, as will the transition to a vortex crystal that takes place at high vortex density in 2D. The Reynolds number will be varied systematically to bridge the gap between these phenomena and related states in bacterial suspensions at low Reynolds numbers. The possibility of an analogous state in rapidly rotating 3D turbulence will be investigated in detail using a new reformulation of the Navier-Stokes fluid equations, extending direct numerical simulations to smaller Rossby numbers, together with a theoretical analysis dissecting the amplitude-phase relationships between large-scale structures and small-scale turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using a culturally sustaining approach, this project will co-design, augment, and evaluate the Smart Playground to promote computational thinking with approximately 500 Latinx kindergarten students and their teachers and families from Santa Ana, CA. Using a Design Based Implementation Research approach and a variety of participatory design techniques, this project will create several prototypes of the Smart Playground and corresponding classroom activities. This work is guided by the following research questions: 1.) What is the impact of engaging with the Smart Playground on children?s computational thinking? 2.) How do varied design elements in the Smart Playground support the development of different aspects of computational thinking among children? 3.) In what ways do Latinx children, teachers, and families in Santa Ana propose to integrate local, cultural, and learning practices into the Smart Playground during co-design activities? A wide range of quantitative and qualitative data governing student gains in computational thinking during baseline, implementation, and follow-up phases will inform the iterative process of design-test-redesign. The project will also collect, transcribe, and analyze observations, interviews, and meeting records to develop thematic insights into culturally sustaining designs and re-design of the Smart Playground elements. Ultimately, this project will result in an evidenced based set of prototypes and lessons that promote computational thinking and build from the cultural strengths of Latinx children. Designs and lessons will prioritize usable and scalable materials to create playful computational thinking opportunities in classrooms and playgrounds across the country and the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across humans, non-human animals, and plants, many epidemics are seasonal ? that is, they are started or accelerated by shifts in the seasonal environment. Prediction of future epidemics may be improved by a more precise understanding of how shifts in the seasonal environment cause epidemics. A challenge for understanding the causes of seasonal epidemics is that these epidemics often involve ecological interactions such as competition among multiple species of organisms. To address this challenge, this project will conduct a series of experiments under field conditions on interactions between multiple fungal pathogens infecting a shared plant host. To increase the public?s involvement in science, the project scientists will partner with a science museum to apply current methods for effective engagement of the public, to integrate the project?s approaches and findings into K-12 educational curricula, and to develop interactive exhibits for the public. This project will use a model system to develop innovative approaches that can be applied in other systems to understand the causes of seasonal epidemics, improve agricultural practices, and improve our capacity to predict epidemics. <br/><br/>Recent theory predicts that the outcome of species interactions between pathogens or parasites within a host individual can be influenced by the community context in which they are embedded. As ecological communities assemble over time, these context-dependent interactions create historical contingency. To resolve the roles of species interactions and environmental conditions in seasonal epidemics, this project will manipulate within-host interactions and quantify disease transmission in the context of seasonally varying environmental conditions. The project will leverage an experimentally tractable field system: two fungal pathogens (Rhizoctonia<br/>solani and Colletotrichum cereale) that infect leaves of the widespread and agriculturally important grass species tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum). Using this system, the researchers will conduct field experiments that manipulate the history of disease transmission. The project will employ an integrative approach that uses field experiments conducted at two ecological levels ? host individuals and populations ? and bridges across those levels with a dynamical model. In this integrative framework, the project will investigate additional layers of biological complexity, including the seasonal dynamics of parasite genetic lineages, and influences of the host microbiome on disease transmission. Ultimately, this project will further our understanding of when within-host species interactions, in concert with environmental conditions, can govern seasonal shifts in disease transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the addition of chlorine to wastewater also results in the production of unintended chemical byproducts that may be toxic. This project will characterize the reaction of chlorine with alcohols, such as methanol (wood alcohol) and ethanol, which are present in wastewater, to produce aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, reactive compounds that can have deleterious biological properties, particularly in adducting biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins.  Understanding the chemistry of aldehyde production from alcohols and chlorine is important to minimize the formation of these chemicals during wastewater treatment. In the face of climate change and drought, communities across the United States lack reliable sources of drinking water. Re-using wastewater (sewage) is an option to increase water supply in areas facing water stress. Wastewater reuse involves many treatment steps to ensure the water is safe to drink. Undergraduate researchers from both institutions will contribute to the work and inform the scientific community about the project findings through social media.<br/><br/>During wastewater reuse, oxidation with ozone or chlorine to inactivate pathogens and transform chemical contaminants can form toxic low molecular weight compounds including aldehydes. While aldehyde generation from ozonation of wastewater is well understood, the kinetics, mechanism of formation, and potential precursors during chlorination are largely unknown. This project will investigate the formation of aldehydes from the chlorination of an overlooked group of precursors: alcohols. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that methanol can be oxidized to formaldehyde by chlorine under conditions relevant to water treatment. Alcohols such as methanol and ethanol are frequently used as a supplemental carbon source during conventional wastewater treatment, and are likely present in water reuse operations. Additionally, alcohols are routinely used in environmental chemical research for stock solution preparation under the assumption that they are inert with respect to chlorine. The goals of this project include determining the kinetics, products, and mechanism of aqueous alcohol oxidation by chlorine, the development of a new method for quantifying trace alcohols in complex aqueous matrices, and its application to quantify alcohols in wastewater effluent and their contribution to observed aldehyde formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Cambridge and the sponsoring scientist is Prof. Giles E.D. Oldroyd.<br/><br/>To sustain and expand food production in a growing global population, next generation crop varieties must be developed that take advantage of natural systems to improve nutrient capture rather than rely on excessive application of inorganic nutrients. Fortunately, most crop species can greatly improve their ability to capture and use essential nutrients through symbiotic relationships with beneficial soil fungi. This symbiosis, however, is restricted if high concentrations of nitrogen or phosphorus have been applied to the soil, limiting the utility. The goal of this research is to characterize unknown signals that regulate symbiosis under high nutrient conditions; thereby identifying crop genotypes that use less input while maintaining high productivity. This project also seeks to democratize and remove financial, geographic and time limitations of large-scale genome editing projects, which is critical for international molecular plant improvement. Broader impacts from this project include generating genetic and technological resources for the plant science community, educating citizen scientists interested in how gene editing contributes to reducing fertilizer use, and translating results for crop improvement and sustainable food production. Training objectives include obtaining hands-on expertise in applying genetic and genomic tools to address biologically important questions.  <br/><br/>Split root experiments suggest that nutrient suppression of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis exists through largely unknown systemic process in addition to local mechanisms. Secreted peptides have been demonstrated to be a critical component of systemic symbiosis regulation and nutrient response. This research will characterize systemic peptides that regulate symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi in response to differential nutrient conditions. Connecting multiple environmental conditions to their signaling response will be accomplished by developing a new method of Viral Induced Mutant Stacking to rapidly stack targeted mutations across a population. This novel genetic screening technique will be applied to create a combinatorial population of peptide mutants and isolate genetic backgrounds enabling symbiosis under nutrient suppressive conditions. Mutant populations and genetic engineering reagents generated during this project will be immediately available to researchers for independent investigations. New technology developed in this research can be used to study complex, integrated, phenotypic responses while providing valuable insight into the systemic regulation of symbiosis. Causal alleles identified using this approach can quickly be incorporated into agriculturally relevant species for rapid crop improvement. All data, genetic and molecular resources, and methodological advances will be made freely available to the general scientific community through public long-term repositories and upon request.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many current separation approaches require massive amounts of energy and still suffer from efficiency and yield issues. Membranes consisting of a crystalline material called zeolites have successfully overcome some of these limitations. Zeolites have regular, nanoscale pores that act as molecular filters. The chemical synthesis technique determines the exact pore size, which can be tuned to specific molecular separation needs. While zeolites typically take the form of membranes, they have recently been created in a nanotube form, yielding a structure with a central channel enclosed by walls containing smaller pores. This research project will use molecular simulation techniques to model this novel zeolite nanotube structure in a range of different chemical environments, assessing its potential to enhance zeolite-based separation technologies. The simulation results will produce foundational knowledge to understand the capabilities of these multiscale structures and to enable the design of separation techniques that exploit their unique geometry. Research results will be incorporated into undergraduate thermodynamics courses and high school-student summer camps hosted at the University of Dayton. The project?s educational activities will also promote the importance of statistical data analysis among the next generation of chemical engineers. <br/><br/>The primary objective of this research project is to comprehensively characterize the adsorption and transport behavior of the newly synthesized zeolite nanotubes (ZNTs) via molecular simulation. Zeolites are promising adsorbent materials for separating gaseous mixtures, various organic solutions, and use as desalination membranes. The research tasks are designed to evaluate the ability of ZNTs to replicate planar zeolite behaviors and how they perform in higher dimensional structures such as ZNT arrays and as additives to polymeric membranes. The ZNTs? multiscale features are expected to allow for pressure-driven flow, while filtration occurs radially through the zeolitic walls. The project?s results will inform the design of potentially transformative separation technologies using these hierarchically-structured materials. The principal investigator is heavily involved in operating high school-level engineering summer camps hosted at the University of Dayton. This project?s results and computational methods will be incorporated into the summer camp curriculum to build interest in separation sciences and promote the importance of statistical data analysis in engineering. Similar instruction materials will also be used to develop a new undergraduate/graduate course on designing effective experiments using statistical techniques, thus, preparing students to approach real-world engineering problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will employ experimental techniques, including ones that provide information as the reaction occurs, and computational methods to gain in depth insight into this process. The particular crystal polymorph often dictates key properties of nanocrystalline materials and, consequently, the applications for which these can be used, for example, in photovoltaics, catalysis, and energy storage. Therefore, having the knowledge and ability to control the crystal structure is important. The broader impacts of this work are centered around (a) providing experimental and computational training to the students working on this project and (b) summer research experiences for undergraduate students from Puerto Rico that aim to complement the training they receive at their home institutions to better prepare them for the workforce and/or pursuing a graduate degree.  <br/><br/>The ability to rationally synthesize a given polymorph or phase of a nanoparticles is desirable as these dictate their mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. The proposed work synergistically combines experimental and computational methods to provide a holistic framework for a model system where halides drive the control of crystal structure/phase in the synthesis of manganese chalcogenide nanocrystals. This framework will encompass identifying pre-nucleation molecular species, performing thermochemical measurement of reaction and surface-ligand interactions, and monitoring the kinetics of nucleation and growth. A suite of in situ techniques will be employed to enable such measurements under the reaction conditions. Quantum-mechanics-based calculations will be used to identify atomic-scale interactions and the mechanisms that lead to the observed crystal structures/phases. These calculations will provide input for kinetic and thermodynamic models of nanocrystal nucleation and growth and, therefore, will produce multi-scale-based computational guidance for the controlled synthesis of metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. The studies will be extended to lanthanide chalcogenide nanocrystals, which have remained largely unexplored despite unique optical and magnetic properties. This work is anticipated to further increase the level of chemical understanding of the synthesis of Mn and Ln chalcogenide nanocrystals, and such insights have the potential to provide guidance to the scientific community for the synthesis of other classes of materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will also involve labeling misconceptions in the collected data and the development and systematic evaluation of machine learning models based on VR tracking and input data for predicting when QubitVR learners are likely to have a misconception. As a second aim, the project will adaptively tutor QIS misconceptions by developing two intelligent tutoring versions of QubitVR: one that employs proactive conceptual scaffolds based on the machine learning models and one that employs reactive scaffolds based on conventional action-condition rules-based reasoning.

This seemingly simple concept leads to remarkably difficult unsolved problems in mathematics, with implications in areas such as biology, chemistry, computer science, and physics. This project focuses on investigating the connection between two fundamental objects in number theory: modular forms and hypergeometric functions. The theory of classical modular forms has long played an important role in number theory and was essential in Wiles? proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem. More recently, generalized modular forms have become central objects of study, and can be understood through differential equations satisfied by classical modular forms. Special functions known as classical hypergeometric functions are known to satisfy very similar differential equations, suggesting a connection between hypergeometric functions and modular forms. In turn, hypergeometric functions provide arithmetic information for various mathematical objects, including multi-parameter families of Calabi-Yau manifolds leading to applications in string theory. An overall expectation is that hypergeometric functions provide a new direction in understanding the phenomena arising in mirror symmetry, one of the central research themes binding string theory and algebraic geometry. This project will make use of this connection to hypergeometric functions to study the arithmetic properties and applications of general modular forms. The broader impacts of this project include mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in research, organizing conferences and workshops, continuing to work on outreach programs with middle and high school students, and disseminating data and expository notes.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will study the properties of modular forms in relation to character sums and differential equations ? especially those of hypergeometric type ? using methods from arithmetic geometry, Galois theory, and Galois representations.

The main goals are: <br/>(1) to discover the arithmetic properties of modular forms on Shimura curves through explicit constructions; <br/>(2) to advance the understanding of hypergeometric systems and the modularity of hypergeometric Galois representations; and <br/>(3) to exploit the relations between hypergeometric functions and modular forms for arithmetic triangle groups to understand the fundamental properties of these two objects, such as their values at complex multiplication points and L-values.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Research on Emerging Technologies for Teaching and Learning (RETTL) project will develop immersive XR (Extended Reality) and web-based (non-immersive) learning experiences for first-year college students taking chemistry lab courses. The technology proposed in this project  will provide an effective introduction to the undergraduate chemistry lab that will reinforce their knowledge of chemistry terminology while minimizing anxiety associated with performing experiments for the  first time in an unfamiliar and timed setting. Newly designed modules will orient incoming students to the chemistry laboratory and introduce them to experiments that augment the lecture portion of their courses. The purpose of these modules is to supplement and reinforce lab training through an active learning, multi-sensory learning interface. While many studies have focused on Virtual Reality (VR) experiences in education, this project specifically examines the emotional and cognitive impacts of Extended Reality interventions on students and aims to improve upon the technology, based on student feedback throughout the project. In addition, as the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted, there is a need to develop virtual educational tools that provide comparable experiences for all students. <br/><br/>This project examines an innovative introduction to the chemistry lab experience by applying the use of virtual reality technology to chemistry education. The study will examine the extent to which VR and XR training modules can prepare students for entry to a chemistry lab course, reinforce conventional lab training, boost knowledge of chemistry literacy, and minimize anxiety associated with performing  experiments. The project goal is to deliver transformative experiences through XR technology that will positively impact the ability of undergraduates in first-year chemistry courses to engage with and persist in scientific settings. The project will employ an inclusive design-centered approach to the development of the XR modules, where extensive suggestions from students and other stakeholders will refine and improve the technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The type of parts depends on the nature of the object at hand. This proposal is focused on questions amenable to a dyadic approach: the simpler parts are usually some variation of a small, square signal which takes only two values. Huge advancements have been made since Stefanie Petermichl?s discovery in 2000, that one of the most studied operators in analysis, the Hilbert transform, can be expressed in a meaningful way as an average of such simple operators. Central to this project will be the advancement of Petermichl?s work by relating it to several long-standing open questions in harmonic analysis. An especially exciting path will be building a bridge between two ?competing? methods in modern harmonic analysis, the Bellman function method and the sparse operator domination approach. This has the likelihood of becoming a new ?method? in its own, as it involves new ideas from two leading methods in harmonic analysis. The project further includes organization of activities in harmonic analysis, as well as working with and training graduate students.<br/> <br/>The starting point is an open problem on the dyadic square function which has baffled the field for quite some time. Here, weighted inequalities, specifically with Muckenhoupt weights, will be settled. These types of inequalities have recently dominated modern harmonic analysis, and the dyadic square function is one of the most important operators in the field - especially because it can be viewed as the starting point of Littlewood-Paley theory. The question to then tackle will be the sharp power of the Muckenhoupt characteristic in the weak norm in the Hilbert space setting (parameter p=2). All other situations except the Hilbert space setting (p not equal to 2) are known, which makes it even more strange that this question is still open ? usually, the Hilbert space setting is the ?simple? case one extracts all other values from. However, the nonlinear nature of the dyadic square function turns this all on its head, in a quite unique situation. The planned approach, to merge new ideas for Bellman functions with new ideas for sparse operators, has seen significant recent progress. Much broader applications of this approach are anticipated as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is inspired by phenomena observed in nature such as how pinecones and wheat are able to dispense their seeds. The team will develop protein polymers that mimic those found in nature, explore their water-responsive motion, and explore the mechanical power generated by the material. The work will investigate: 1) the role of structure in such protein polymers; 2) the effects of protein polymer composition on water-responsiveness; and 3)  how the nature of the molecular assembly leads to changes in their water-responsiveness. The ultimate goal is to achieve an understanding that will allow the team  to design new water responsive protein polymers assemblies that can efficiently convert motion into usable energy. This may lead to the development of high-power moving components for widespread applications such as robotics, shape-morphing and energy harvesting devices. This highly interdisciplinary research, involving protein engineering, chemical engineering and materials science, will provide training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. In collaborative outreach efforts, the team will hold an annual ?Biomimetic Technology? event that includes local New York City K-12 students and teachers to interact with state-of-the-art science to promote interest in science and increase public understanding of macromolecular science and engineering concepts.<br/><br/>Evaporation-induced shape change has proven to be an efficient mechanism for the conversion of energy from water?s chemical potential to mechanical energy. Owing to this property, water responsive (WR) materials can swell and shrink in response to relative humidity (RH) changes, and recent studies have shown that biological WR materials can generate significantly higher energy actuation than all known muscles and actuators. Here, the team will focus on creating shape-shifting protein engineered assemblies that fundamentally integrate nano-scaled structural features that can hierarchically assemble and lead to macroscale function of energy conversion from the chemical potential of water to mechanical motion. The team will investigate how supramolecular self-assembly and phase separation influence the WR properties of protein engineered block-copolypeptides (BCPs). To achieve this the team aims to investigate: 1) the role of structure in the engineered BCPs; 2) the effects of the surface blocks on BCP water-responsiveness; and 3) the effect of supramolecular structure with water-responsiveness. This fundamental understanding is expected to help the researchers develop a set of parameters to inform the design of biological WR actuators with high energy and power densities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the river landscape changes due to climate change, severe droughts, floods, and human interventions, the fluvial ecosystems and their ecological and economic values respond in unprecedented ways, and the majority of these cases cannot currently be predicted. Understanding and predicting transient dynamics in river systems through tools that accurately estimate flow and sediment transport is still limited, partially because of the difficulty of monitoring sediment but also because of the inability to understand the fluid dynamics. This work aims to provide a theoretical and numerical framework to study the feedback between turbulent flow, sediment transport, and geomorphologic changes in river systems. The principal investigator and students will develop and implement state-of-the-art physically-based models aided by machine learning that allow the quantification and forecasting of the flow and sediment dynamics in field-scale rivers. The education and outreach plan, integrated with the research objectives, focuses on (1) engaging undergraduate, and graduate level students into Earth science, through participatory writing for the creation of a science comic book, followed by high school curriculum development, as tools to enhance Earth science pedagogy, and (2) public outreach through the university art museum that is considered to be an informal learning environment.<br/><br/>This study addresses explicitly how convoluted fluid dynamics manifest in fluvial environments, such as regions of massive flow separation, secondary flows, high-velocity core plunges, velocity inversions, and free shear layers; and the role played by macro-turbulence in sediment transport and river morpho-dynamics. The overall objective is to transform the state of the art in quantifying and predicting the fundamental physics of the coupled fluid and sediment mechanisms that control the morpho-dynamic changes in fluvial systems. A hybrid physics-based/ machine learning algorithm coupled with a sediment transport and morphodynamic solver will be developed and tested at different spatial scales, from laboratory to large river reaches. The hydro-morphodynamic model will use the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques to resolve macro-turbulence and predict the sediment concentration and riverbed evolution in the computational domain. A dynamically adaptive, process-based domain re-meshing, based on machine learning algorithms, will be applied to refine the complex topography in areas where turbulent structures are dominant and fundamental to understanding and quantifying erosion and depositional processes present in recirculation zones and plunging flows, thus ensuring a sufficient spatial scale resolution to represent geomorphologic processes. Once the fundamental framework is validated, it could be adapted to different river environments to test its spatio-temporal transferability. The expected societal outcomes of the educational component are focused on: (1) enhancing Earth science learning among students, (2) modifying stereotypes of members in the Earth science community, and (3) increasing participation in Earth science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials are packed into stainless steel tubes and the strength of the chemical interaction sites on the stationary phase is varied along the length of the tube. When coupled with a traditional liquid mobile phase gradient, which displaces the analyte molecules sequentially as the strength of mobile phase solvent is increased, such materials have the potential to provide significantly improved selectivity in the separation of large biomolecules. An important obstacle to realizing such improved selectivity in practice is the ability to experimentally fabricate these mixed-mode gradient stationary phases in a controlled and predictable fashion.  This challenge will be addressed in the present work through a combination of experimental design and simulation via a continued collaboration with Dr. Sarah Rutan, an expert in the field of chromatographic simulations and their predictive power.  This will project provide opportunities for both scientific discovery and student training and learning.  This research is expected to advance knowledge in the field of separation science, particularly in areas that target the analysis of large, biologically relevant molecules including proteins, peptides, and ultimately monoclonal antibodies that are of particular interest in the development of novel biologic pharmaceuticals. It explores an original concept aimed to improve the selectivity of a separation and ultimately the resolution of chemically similar analytes within complex protein samples.Students involved in this project will obtain valuable expertise in the packing of chromatography columns, the modification of silica using silane chemistry, and its detailed characterization using TGA and other spectroscopic and microscopic tools. Simultaneously, they will become experts in LC and the separation of mixtures of biomolecules making them uniquely employable in the biopharmaceutical field. <br/><br/>In most chemical separations, the gradient is in the mobile phase.  An alternate paradigm puts the gradient on the stationary phase.  Recent simulated work has shown that dual stationary phase gradients when coupled with a mobile phase gradient can ?open up previously unseen selectivities? in the separation of large biomolecules.  In the present work, the challenges associated with the fabrication and implementation of such mixed-mode stationary phase gradients suitable for biomolecule separations will be addressed.  Through the course of this work, new approaches will be explored to strategically modify a particle-packed silica column with a functionalized monochlorosilane (e.g., phenyl, C8, C4,...) in a gradient fashion.  The steepness of the gradients will be varied and optimized so that when coupled with a mobile phase gradient synergistic selectivity and/or band compression will be observed in the separation of biomolecules.  Simulation methods will be developed to predict the chromatographic response and to optimize the conditions for column fabrication. The gradient lengths and compositions needed to obtain optimum separations will be obtained by coupling simulations with experiments, thus avoiding the trial-and-error approach usually used in materials development. Over the long term, the new column technology and accompanying simulations developed through this research have the potential to impact the fields of proteomics and lipidomics, as well as two-dimensional liquid chromatographic separations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing technologies have rapidly matured in pursuit of geometric complexity, scalability, and reproducibility; however, similar advances in customized, application-specific engineered materials are limited. Innovations to control printed architectures across both microstructural and component levels enable the realization of advanced multi-functional, multi-material composites. Such capabilities are critical to addressing the demanding material requirements of transformative technologies including high-capacity energy storage, clean energy, and quantum computing. This research project seeks to develop, understand, and validate the application of external fields, such as acoustic fields, within additive manufacturing processes and discover the fundamental process mechanisms that enable precise spatial control over micro- and nanoparticle constituents. The cross-disciplinary nature of this research expands opportunities for interdisciplinary training and positions this project for enhancing interest K-12 students in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM). This project establishes education and outreach activities directly integrated with research outcomes including: (i) an annual Additive Manufacturing Make-a-thon focused on innovative distributed manufacturing technologies, (ii) a culture-based engineering outreach program to promote careers in STEAM to Native Hawaiian students, (iii) mentored research opportunities to support STEAM education and workforce development, and (iv) curriculum innovation at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <br/><br/>The specific goal of this research is to discover the scientific foundations for the additive manufacturing of acoustically assembled multi-scale composite materials with engineered properties resulting from deterministically ordered microstructures. A central challenge to creating nanoparticle-based composite materials is the control of the spatial distribution of nanoparticles across multiple length-scales. External fields, such as acoustic fields, have been shown to enable spatial control over microscale particles during a direct deposition additive manufacturing process. The research project proposes an acoustophoretic additive manufacturing method that combines three mechanisms to enable the continuous hierarchical assembly of bulk materials: (i) surface functionalization to create ordered/disordered micron-scale nanoparticle aggregates in solution, (ii) acoustic fields to assemble microscale aggregates into mesoscale structures, and (iii) direct deposition of these mesoscale structures into bulk components. The project combines theoretical and experimental studies to systematically investigate and reveal the fundamental principles governing the mechanics of flow-based, field-assisted additive manufacturing across multiple length scales. A key focus is to obtain a better understanding of the processing-structure-property relationships governing the use of acoustic fields to fabricate multiscale composite materials with specific, functionally-graded properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will involve the development of integral formulations to accurately simulate transport properties of these materials. An inverse scattering method will also be devised to characterize the coefficients in the differential models from far field scattering measurements. Another important thrust of the project is to propose a semiclassical analysis of wave-packet propagation along conducting interfaces separating such insulators. On the medical imaging side, the main objective of this proposal is to analyze inverse transport models such as the Fokker Planck  and the integral geometric settings that appear in multi-energy computerized tomography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

International exchange of students in this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will advance soft matter research through sharing ideas and experimental capabilities and will promote the U.S. students? professional development through participation in an academic cohort and conducting research abroad. Cohorts of PhD students from North Carolina State University (NCSU), Duke University, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC) will participate in 10-week summer research experiences in soft matter at the Dresden University of Technology and associated research institutes (TUD+). The cohort of North Carolina (NC) students will have pre-departure activities in NC and will travel and live together in Dresden, Germany, where they will conduct research with different hosts but will have a common academic and social program. This project further aims to catalyze development of long-term collaborations between NC and Dresden researchers.<br/><br/>Dresden has a dynamic research environment that has received massive investment since German reunification and is welcoming to visiting researchers. Several research clusters and centers throughout TUD+ support large-scale programs in soft matter. Hosts at TUD+ will prepare brief descriptions of research projects for IRES students. An initial group of 17 hosts spanning all areas of soft matter have expressed interest in hosting IRES students. The hosts will be vetted by the principal foreign collaborator and will provide office and lab space, supplies and equipment for research, mentoring, and training for the research project. PhD students from NCSU, Duke, and UNC will be selected based on their academic preparation, letter of recommendation, essays articulating their interest in the IRES experience, and matching with the available research projects. Participation of underrepresented groups will be promoted by contacting local chapters of science and engineering societies for underrepresented groups at NCSU, Duke, and UNC. The IRES cohort will live together and have a weekly research meeting. At the end of the summer, the IRES students will present their results in a research symposium. Several outings around Dresden and a brief trip to Berlin to visit selected scientific and cultural institutions and historical sites will educate the cohort about the broader societal and historical context in which scientific research is conducted and its importance to economic prosperity and political stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ""Integrating Montana's Environmental Research with Smart Sensors"" (IMERSS) project will improve the understanding of prescribed fire dynamics and the impact of prescribed fire on Montana?s communities and public lands by producing new sensor technologies to characterize fuel types and smoke emissions.  The novel, smart optical sensor systems will contribute to the region?s economic infrastructure through partnerships with Montana?s expanding optics-based industry. Outcomes of IMERSS research will enable managers of prescribed fires to develop and refine strategies for deploying prescribed fires effectively to mitigate wildfire risk, a benefit that will extend to local and federal agencies tasked with land management and wildfire mitigation across the Western U.S. The broader impacts activities of IMERSS include an extensive internship and workforce development plan, integration of community and Tribal college participants, and a focus on K-12 education and outreach to the community. The project will create well-defined STEM professional development pathways and broaden participation across Montana in environmental, social, and engineering research. IMERSS will be administered by Montana State University in collaboration with six other institutions: University of Montana, Montana Technological University, Salish Kootenai College, Little Big Horn College, Flathead Valley Community College.<br/><br/>IMERSS research will focus on: 1) how prescribed fire?s energy and emissions depend on fuel properties, topography, and environmental conditions, and 2) how smoke emissions from prescribed fires affect individuals and communities.  To answer these questions, IMERSS will develop a new generation of smart optical sensors that couple emerging engineering technologies with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). IMERSS will then deploy the new instruments to measure prescribed fire behavior in real time, acquiring spatially accurate, real-time data about fuels, smoke aerosol type, smoke plume height, smoke trajectory, and social acceptance of prescribed fire and smoke. The acquisition of this data will allow managers of prescribed fires to make better-informed decisions about when and where to burn, and for how long.  These decisions can be shared with individuals and Montana?s community leaders to minimize the adverse effects of prescribed fire.  Thus, IMERSS will produce scientifically grounded strategies for selecting the locations and the timing of prescribed fire events to maximize their benefits and mitigate wildfire and smoke risk.  In doing so, IMERSS will build capacity in Montana by forging ties between researchers in environmental science, remote sensing, optical engineering, AI and ML, and social science.  Four new faculty hires are planned in the first two years of the project, all in AI and ML. The core research program is well integrated with education, workforce development, and diversity plans that span academic, Tribal, public, and private sectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to studying the impact of the revised curriculum on computational thinking, the current project will assess the curriculum?s impact on: science curiosity; affinity for science, technology, and engineering; youths' self-perceptions as computational professionals; and increased knowledge of and/or interest in STEM-related careers and pursuits. This work will solidify a research-practice partnership in two states with the youth-serving organization, Upward Bound. The project will work with 60 youth in Upward Bound summer camps in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and employ computer science and engineering graduates involved in wearable technology industries (e.g., biomedical devices, fitness trackers, robotics, and smart fabrics) as near-peer mentors during the program. The mentors have been recruited to challenge typical stereotypes about who can create technology, and will be trained in anti-racist and equity-based mentorship practices. The project will produce a refined curriculum which will be shared with high school summer camp providers, with the intent to broaden participation of Black and Hispanic/Latinx youth in STEAM-Maker   camps.<br/><br/>The research will support further theorization around the linkages between curiosity, computational thinking, STEM career interest, and science curiosity.

Some bacteria, for example, are attracted toward each other by chemical signals and can form large cohesive clusters that act as a new super-organism. This ability to aggregate is essential to their ability to survive and proliferate. The mathematical description of these bacteria's behavior is similar to that of other self-organizing phenomena, such as the flocking behavior of birds or congested crowd motion, and analogous ideas have been used to model tumor growth. In all cases, cohesive group formation is the result of the competition between long-range attractive and short-range repulsive interactions between the members. The investigator will study the relationship between the one-to-one local interactions and the resulting collective motion for a class of mathematical models that take in consideration these two competing forces. These models are often complex systems of partial differential equations, which describe the motion of individual members or of the members' density distribution function. The goal of this research is to derive, via asymptotic analysis and singular limits, new effective models of geometric type describing the collective motion. And, to use these simpler models to theoretically and numerically study the long time dynamic of a population of bacteria, predict the behavior of a crowd, or compare the effects of different therapies on tumor growth. The project will offer research training opportunity for students.<br/> <br/>The investigator will primarily study models for which an interface separating regions of high and low aggregation density can be identified (phase separation). So, while the starting point is a system of partial differential equations that describes the evolution of a density function, the resulting collective motion is modeled by a free boundary approximation describing the evolution of an interface. A rigorous mathematical analysis will be developed using tools from the theory of partial differential equations, the calculus of variation, optimal transportation, and geometric measure theory. A key goal is to provide rigorous justification of the fact that nonlocal attractive behavior has the same smoothing effect on the interface as surface tension (at an appropriate scale). An asymptotic analysis will be performed first on macroscopic models (e.g., diffusion-aggregation equations) and then on mesoscopic models, such as kinetic equations. Understanding how congestion effects can be account for in kinetic models is an important aspect of this research. The investigator will also derive and study free boundary approximations modeling cell motility. The rigorous analysis of these models will establish the instability and symmetry breaking properties, which correspond to well documented behaviors of cells (the so-called self-polarization of cells). Finally, many of the models discussed here have a particular structure: They are gradient flows with respect to the Wasserstein distance - which is defined via the theory of optimal transportation. The investigator will pursue the development of a regularity theory for optimal transportation in a discrete setting. This is an important step toward developing effective numerical methods in the field of optimal transportation, with application to the models discussed above.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peptides are naturally occurring molecules found in all organisms that perform important biological functions, including acting as signaling hormones, including such bioactive peptides as insulin and oxytocin. Peptides can adopt different conformations that influence how they interact with each other. Beta-sheets are one common peptide structural motif. Peptides that assume beta-sheet conformations often rapidly self-assemble into nanofibrils. Some of these nanofibril assemblies are associated with protein misfolding disorders like Alzheimer?s disease and others have been designed to be functional biomaterials. In this work, the team will study how these peptides the co-assemble into these structures. Novel beta-sheet materials, ?rippled? beta-sheets, that are distinct from the ?pleated? beta-sheets found in nature, will be studied using experimental and computational techniques. These efforts will provide critical insight into the structure of both natural and artificial beta-sheets and the molecular-scale interactions that dictate the assembly of these materials. This research is directed at opening up new avenues for the design of next generation peptide-based nanomaterials. Outreach activity associated with this work includes an inquiry based mini-course on hydrogels called ?The Science of Slime? which will be conducted at the participating institutions for pre-university students from grades 7-12.

The second is the Allen-Cahn equation, where the solution strategy of physics-inspired neural networks is analyzed. In the second problem, the adaptivity of neural networks to low-dimensional moving interfaces plays a key role when comparing to e.g. fixed mesh finite element methods.

Continental environments experience greater negative consequences of climate change, such as fire, drought, and floods, than marine ecosystems, and thus it is critical that we understand how to correctly map chemical signals in terrestrial sediments to climatic and environmental parameters (e.g. temperature, water scarcity). Carbonates that form in terrestrial environments often precipitate rapidly before equilibrium is achieved between the mineral and water, skewing the chemistry recorded by the mineral. This research will investigate the role of disequilibrium imparted during rapid mineral formation on important climate archives through an investigation of modern and fossil carbonates formed in lakes and wetlands in the western US and Canada. Understanding how Earth?s surface environments and water resources have responded to varied climate states, and in particular, globally warm periods, is crucial in developing viable strategies to mitigate the effects on human populations. This study will provide new context to stable isotope-based records of land surface water availability and temperatures. The research team will also develop in-person and virtual climate science curriculum and STEM career programming in rural Pennsylvania high schools, and publish virtual education modules to an open-access repository for K-12 educators.<br/>To understand the response of terrestrial ecosystems to global or regional hydroclimate perturbations and hyperthermal events, we must understand how terrestrial sediments archive paleoenvironmental information. Carbonate minerals often precipitate rapidly?potentially before isotopic equilibrium is achieved?within lakes, wetlands, and soils due to natural fluctuations in temperature, water balance, and mineral saturation state. Interpreting the isotopic compositions of these minerals as a record of thermodynamic equilibrium can lead to significant error in temperature and hydroclimate reconstructions. This study will characterize disequilibrium dual clumped isotope signals (?47-?48) in a suite of calcium carbonate facies that form by different mechanisms in modern (Cariboo Plateau, Canada), Pleistocene (Mono Lake, California), and Paleogene (Green River Fm, Colorado/Wyoming/Utah) lakes and wetlands to generate a more robust isotopic framework for interpreting terrestrial carbonates in the geologic record at different stages of diagenesis. Sedimentology will be partnered with isotope analyses to discern the ?47-?48 ?disequilibrium signal??the magnitude and trend from thermodynamic equilibrium?for specific modes of terrestrial carbonate production. The researchers predict that terrestrial carbonate facies that form rapidly will record ?47 and ?48 disequilibrium whereas facies that form more slowly will record equilibrium, with the facies-specific dependence due to the carbon cycling mechanisms within each mineral formation micro-environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to advance QIS education by using virtual reality (VR) and machine learning to adaptively address misconceptions about the field. The project will directly impact the education of approximately 120 undergraduate students learning QIS and has the potential to help transform how to motivate and prepare students for future quantum workforce positions.<br/><br/>This project will leverage QubitVR, a VR application previously developed for learning foundational QIS concepts like superposition, measurement, and entanglement.

This aim will include the development and validation of a new QIS Concept Introductory Test (QISCIT) for assessing learning outcomes. It will also involve labeling misconceptions in the collected data and the development and systematic evaluation of machine learning models based on VR tracking and input data for predicting when QubitVR learners are likely to have a misconception. As a second aim, the project will adaptively tutor QIS misconceptions by developing two intelligent tutoring versions of QubitVR: one that employs proactive conceptual scaffolds based on the machine learning models and one that employs reactive scaffolds based on conventional action-condition rules-based reasoning.

In this approach, teachers recognize and attend to the diversity and substance of all students? ideas and leverage those ideas in instruction. Yet, learning to engage in responsive mathematics teaching is challenging as this work requires interpreting classroom activity in-the-moment and making decisions that are well reasoned and intentional. This decision-making process, known as pedagogical reasoning, is often invisible to observers, making it hard for novices to learn. Teacher education programs typically provide novice teachers with opportunities to work in classrooms, alongside seasoned professionals (mentor teachers), however, the activity of pedagogical reasoning is rarely a focus of such mentoring. Given the importance of mentor teachers for novice teachers? development of instructional practices and the amount of time novices spend in mentored classroom placements, the project researchers view the mentor-novice teacher relationship as a critical site for intervention. This project leverages the role of mentor teachers to support novices? development of pedagogical reasoning and increase the likelihood that they will be prepared to engage in responsive mathematics teaching. Mentor teachers in three differently structured teacher education programs will receive professional development aimed at making their pedagogical reasoning visible and supporting them in engaging collaboratively with novices in this type of teacher thinking. The researchers refer to this type of mentoring as collaborative pedagogical reasoning (Co-PR). They will study mentor teachers? development of Co-PR and its relationship to responsive teaching. They will also consider how different program structures and characteristics influence the development of Co-PR. Findings will produce usable practices for developing teachers? mentoring strategies across different teacher education programs, which will subsequently support mentor and novice teachers? learning of responsive mathematics teaching.<br/><br/>This project aims to enhance the quality of elementary mathematics teaching by supporting mentor teachers to better prepare the next generation of novice teachers to engage in responsive mathematics teaching. This design-based intervention study is based on several hypotheses about how mentor teachers might play a stronger role in supporting novices to develop these practices in K-8 classrooms. Specifically, the researchers hypothesize that if mentor teachers make their pedagogical reasoning visible to novices through engagement in collaborative pedagogical reasoning (Co-PR), then novice teachers will learn about the invisible decision-making that skilled teachers engage in as they carry out responsive mathematics teaching. Further, they hypothesize that mentor teachers can be supported to engage in Co-PR through the design of learning opportunities that afford joint inquiry with others and are mediated with shared tools, designed to guide both disciplinary and equitable aspects of responsive teaching. Using an inquiry group professional development structure at three strategic sites, the researchers aim to build mentoring tools and structured opportunities that support mentor teachers to make visible the layers of their decision making and to facilitate Co-PR with novices before, during, and after teaching. The project team will study the development of mentor and novice teachers? Co-PR, exploring growth in their pedagogical reasoning and factors that contribute to this development. They will also investigate how the enactment of Co-PR differs across teacher education types and programs. Findings will contribute to scholarly insights about mentor and novice teacher development and will generate a set of mentoring tools useful to the fields of mathematics education and teacher education. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Within the world of natural numbers, only 1 and -1 are invertible, yet all non-zero rational numbers have an inverse. In stable homotopy theory, the role that numbers play in ordinary arithmetic is taken by objects called spectra, which arise as algebraic invariants of topological spaces that are unaffected by continuous deformations. There are not very many invertible spectra, only spheres of various dimensions. Here again we observe a phenomenon that the situation changes when we pass to certain localizations analogous to passing from the integers to the rationals. The localizations in question are studied by chromatic homotopy theory, which aims to disassemble complicated homotopical information into building blocks with more understandable with more regular behaviors. This proposal aims to undertake a systematic study of the role of symmetries to get a grasp of the exotic invertible objects in chromatic homotopy, with the hope of understanding the extent to which such exotic objects can be understood as twisted versions of spheres. The main focus of the PIs broader impacts is the rebuilding and strengthening the mathematical community in the post-coronavirus pandemic, through efforts such as organizing workshops, conferences, seminars, discussions, as well as a research program at a mathematical institute, all with a particular emphasis on inclusivity and support for underserved groups.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant will work towards a better understanding of large-scale invertibility phenomena in chromatic homotopy theory, namely the exotic K(n)-local Picard groups, by attempting to organize a variety of ad-hoc computational methods into a systematic investigation using equivariant and representation-theoretic methods. At least two different avenues will be pursued: one is a shift of focus from subgroups to quotients of the Morava stabilizer group, already subtly present in the PIs previous work (with Barthel, Beaudry, Bobkova, Goerss, Henn, and Pham) on determinant spheres, and on the K(2)-local exotic Picard group at the prime 2. The other idea, pursued in a collaboration with Dicks, is a completely new use of Mazurs classical deformation theory of modular representations, which is much less explored but is promising new connections and deeper understanding of invertible objects in chromatic homotopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, this research aims to understand how perceptions of race influence how teachers, future teachers, and researchers assess how bilingual children use their languages and movement to participate in mathematical activity. Second, it will explore ways to counter deficit views that influence teachers?, preservice teachers?, and researchers? perceptions of these multiple ways of participating as inferior to what is traditionally considered as meaningful participation. The project has the potential to improve bilingual children?s wellbeing by helping teachers to develop mathematics classrooms where children can participate on their own terms. This project will also equip teachers and preservice teachers with the research capacity to potentially transform their own classrooms beyond the duration of the project. These transformations may encourage more bilingual children to pursue careers in mathematics-related fields in the future.<br/><br/>This project seeks to answer the overarching research question: How can teachers and researchers affirm bilingual children?s non-normative participation in mathematics classrooms? Using a participatory design research methodology, the project will bring together a raciolinguistic perspective and embodied cognition to: (1) elicit children?s perspectives on participation, (2) co-design lessons with pre- and in-service teachers, and (3) co-analyze children?s linguistic and embodied ways of participating in these lessons. The PI will collaborate with children and teachers in second, third, and fourth grade, including one classroom per grade level in two schools (six teachers and approximately 250 children). The contrasting racial and linguistic backgrounds of children in the two participating schools offer a unique opportunity to learn about the how children?s linguistic and embodied participation is legitimized and delegitimized given their racialized and linguistic differences. Discourse analysis with a focus on translanguaging and qualitative social network analysis will highlight how students use linguistic and embodied participation to make mathematical meaning. Findings will support educators in affirming racially and linguistically diverse students? unique ways of participating. <br/><br/>This CAREER proposal is funded by The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Many natural phenomena (e.g., heat transfer, turbulence, wave propagation, etc.) are governed by differential equations, which result in an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem when discretized. This new algorithm will not only reduce the cost of obtaining accurate results in existing applications but also enable applications which may currently be computationally cost prohibitive.

The computed eigenvectors will not only have the traditional accuracy properties such as small residuals and accuracy with respect to the usual relative gap error bound, but will also possess the mathematical properties of their true counterparts of being orthogonal to working precision and having the correct number of sign changes in each eigenvector. The latter two properties are well determined by the data and stem from the connection of the symmetric tridiagonal matrices with the totally nonnegative matrices (matrices with all minors nonnegative).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been used to answer many questions, including detecting the presence or absence of animal species in an environment, evaluating animal behavior, and identifying ecological stressors and illegal activities. However, current uses are limited to the coverage of relatively small geographic areas with a fixed number of sensors. Animal-borne GPS-based location trackers paired with other sensors are another widely used tool in aiding wildlife conservation and ecosystem monitoring. Since capturing and collaring wild animals is a traumatic event for them, as well as being expensive and resource-intensive, multiyear deployments are required. There are severely limited opportunities to recharge batteries making relatively power-hungry sensing, such as acoustic monitoring, out of reach for existing tracking collars. The aim of the A3EM project is to devise an animal-borne adaptive acoustic monitoring system to enable long-term, real-time observation of the environment and behavior of wildlife. Animal-borne acoustic monitoring will be a novel tool that may provide new insights into biodiversity loss, a severe but underappreciated problem of our time. Combining acoustic monitoring with location tracking collars will enable entirely new applications that will facilitate census gathering and monitoring of threatened and endangered species, detecting poachers of elephants in Africa or caribou in Alaska, and evaluating the effects of mining and logging on wildlife, among many others. All data, hardware designs, and software source code will be released to the public domain, enabling tracking collar manufacturers to include the technology within their products.<br/><br/>A3EM constitutes a complex cyber-physical architecture involving humans, animals, distributed sensing devices, intelligent environmental monitoring agents, and limited power and network connectivity. This intermittently connected CPS, with a power budget an order of magnitude lower than typical, calls for novel approaches with a high level of autonomy and adaptation to the physical environment. A3EM will employ a unique combination of supervised and semi-supervised embedded machine learning to identify new and unexplored event classes in a given environment, dynamically control and adjust parameters related to data acquisition and storage, opportunistically share knowledge and data between distributed sensing devices, and optimize the management of storage and communication to minimize resource needs. These methods will be evaluated through the creation of a wearable acoustic monitoring system used to support ecological applications such as enhanced wildlife protection, rare species identification, and human impact studies on animal behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plastics have untold environmental impacts, and mismanaged plastic waste represents a loss of valuable resources. The Caribbean has three times the mismanaged waste compared to other regions. Most research on waste management has focused on large, wealthy European and US systems.  Those approaches are not applicable for the many small island nations of the Caribbean as the small island nations of the Caribbean import copious amounts of goods, including plastics, but have limited means or space for recycling and recovery.  A circular economy for plastics could reduce global GHG emissions and fuel a more sustainable economy in the Caribbean. This project establishes an international network of Caribbean and US collaborators that will connect the various components of the plastic ecosystem to design sustainable solutions to the plastic economy of the Caribbean. We will collaborate with BioGals, a nonprofit empowering women of color to create sustainable solutions for communities, to support broadening participation in our project. The team will improve understanding of the impacts of microplastics, recover the resources lost when plastics are mismanaged, develop solutions based on local needs with local researchers, and improve understanding of the scale of plastic wastes in conjunction with their environmental impacts.<br/><br/>The team will use a strategic planning process to develop a plastics network strategic plan and research roadmap that at its core ensures sustainability and supports a circular economy. The activities include a workshop and a network event that is part symposium and part design charrette. These events will  develop operational links among networks; design collaborative approaches that would engage students, early-career researchers, and leaders in the identification of knowledge gaps and development of professional skills; and identify knowledge gaps and research needs. This project will prepare U.S. science and engineering students, postdoctoral scholars, and early-career researchers for success in conducting and leading multi-team international collaborations to address the pressing problem of plastic sustainability around the globe, particularly for the Caribbean.

However, one key barrier of bio-AM is that the print quality is substantially below the required industrial standards, partially because of the lack of effective in-situ monitoring and control methods for defect removal. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) grant will support basic research that aims to establish non-contact vibration-based monitoring to identify structural defects of bio-constructs as they are being fabricated. The research outcome is expected to create broad socioeconomic impacts on public health and biomedical fields by realizing the potential of bio-AM and strengthening US competitiveness in bioeconomy. The integrated research and educational program, aligned with the national priorities of biomanufacturing and biotechnology, will stimulate student interest in biomanufacturing, expose undergraduate and graduate students to the research frontiers of bio-AM, and develop the next-generation workforce ready for bioeconomy. <br/><br/>Understanding the formation mechanism of defects is critical for manufacturing high-quality biomaterials. Most existing sensing methods for biomaterials require that sensors be attached on the surface of additively manufactured parts. Due to the soft and light-weight nature of bio-constructs, contact-type sensors may not be suitable. The research objective is to understand how the non-contact, video-based vibration measurements are correlated with various types of defects. Three research tasks are planned: (1) identifying novel feature-based composite damage metrics that incorporate vibration features reflecting both dimensional and embedded defects; (2) establishing a reliable numerical model to understand how the modal properties of bio-constructs are affected by process conditions such as infill patterns and common defects; and (3) identifying the dynamic properties of bioprinting materials such as hydrogels via video-based vibrometry. The data generated from the project will provide a benchmark for the research community to advance research in biomanufacturing and biotechnology. If successful, this research will tremendously improve the structural integrity of bio-AM organs and increase the availability, ultimately saving lives.

Strongest cooling occurs with clear skies and low wind speeds.  This situation is poorly understood compared to other boundary layers with more significant winds or daytime heating. The strong cooling leads to practical issues including freezing street surfaces and frost damage to sensitive crops.  The strong surface cooling also reduces vertical mixing and thus increases the probability of high concentrations of pollutants. The weak winds correspond to large variability of wind direction that spreads the pollutants over a variety of wind directions. This process is currently hard to predict. Formation of dense fog is another outcome of the strong cooling and weak vertical mixing.  Local spatial variation of the surface cooling is an important feature requiring more attention.  This project will increase understanding through analysis of intense measurements from different sites.   Each site contains a network of clustered stations.  The above analyses will improve the boundary-layer part of forecast computer models. <br/><br/>The general analysis of different subclasses of very stable nocturnal boundary layers, and the relation of submeso motions to these subclasses, will be investigated.  Very stable nocturnal boundary layers most often occur with strong stability associated with low wind speeds and clear skies.  Submeso motions occur on scales just larger than the largest turbulent eddies but smaller than the mesoscale motions.  Submeso motions include microfronts, wave motions, meandering motions, and more complex structures.  These motions densely populate the very stable boundary layer.  The analyses will be based on time series, spatial information across networks, and combined time-space domains from different datasets.  The analysis will first concentrate on microfronts. The first stage focusses on increasing horizontal gradients of temperature.  The second stage includes horizontal convergence that concentrates horizontal gradients into microfronts.  Analysis of other submeso motions will follow with both individual analyses of each type of submeso motion and collective analysis of all submeso motions.

In doing so, researchers can understand the resilience of these ecosystems, prepare coastal management for future scenarios, and aid in prioritizing restoration efforts. With at least 52% of the US population living in areas that drain into coastal watersheds, it is imperative for researchers to study the effects of nutrient pollution in coastal systems. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is defined as any and all flow of water from the seabed to the coastal ocean. In areas where the nutrient concentration of coastal groundwater has been substantially increased by changing land use, nutrient loading to coastal waters via SGD has been associated with algae blooms and shifts in the community composition. This research will characterize land-based sources of nutrient pollution and its effects on coral reef productivity and community composition. The results from this research will be shared with state entities. Additionally, the results will aid a non-profit organization focused on restoring the study site in identifying and prioritizing restoration sites. This program will engage up to 10 undergraduates and one post baccalaureate. Peer-reviewed strategies for recruitment and retainment of underrepresented minority students, such as financial incentives and summer-long field-based research, will be used. <br/><br/>Maunalua Bay (O?ahu, HI) has experienced dramatic development and increase in population over the last 100 years. This has affected the water quality in near shore coral reefs. Due to the range of onsite sewage disposal systems density, discrete SGD, and its coral reef habitats, Maunalua Bay is a model system to study land-based effects on water quality and primary production on coral reef communities. The main source of land-based inorganic nutrients in Maunalua Bay is SGD, which delivers both freshwater and inorganic nutrients. This research will use novel methods to characterize SGD delivery to both the water column (drone thermal imagery) and benthos (sensors moored to the reef) of two reefs. The work will also quantify carbon uptake of the main primary producers on algal-dominated reefs. Finally, the productivity of the algae on a reef with SGD and without SGD will be modeled. This work will clarify the magnitude of the effect of SGD on both benthic and water column algal productivity of reefs. More than just understanding the abundance, distribution, and productivity of coastal organisms, the proposed research will get to the physical and chemical mechanisms driving these patterns on a local and regional scale in coral reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Building Research Capacity of New Faculty in Biology Program in the Division of Environmental Biology and the Division of Biological Infrastructure and Biological Oceanography Program in the Division of Ocean Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By beating rhythmically, flagella and cilia move fluid in the local environment of cells. This biological function enables pulmonary mucus clearance in airways and the transport of ovums from the ovary to the uterus for example. Malfunction of flagella and cilia can lead to a group of serious human disorders, ciliopathies, which cause a heavy economic and disease burden on society. However, despite the ubiquity and importance of flagella and cilia, fundamental biomechanics underlying the fluid transport of beating flagella and cilia are still poorly understood. Particularly, the detailed flow field induced by beating flagella and cilia remains unresolved. Combining state-of-the-art microscopy techniques with data-driven machine learning, the research team aims to address this difficult biomechanical problem. This research will investigate the flow field of healthy flagella as well as those of mutant flagella associated with ciliopathies using synergistic experimental and numerical modeling efforts. A potential solution to remedy the flow deficiency of malfunction flagella will be researched. In addition to the training and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, the project will produce appealing scientific videos and demonstrations to enhance the undergraduate curriculum and enrich outreach activities at the local communities of the two principal investigators.  <br/><br/>As a generic model for the morphology and dynamics of flagella and cilia, green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, will be studied in this research program.

Both wild-type and mutant algae of different swimming modes will be investigated. The mechanical efficiency of flagellar dynamics will be analyzed based on the 3D flow field. Moreover, using the experimental flow field as a basis of reference and taking advantage of modern machine-learning algorithms, the team plans to develop a numerical model of maximal simplicity that can quantitatively capture the algal flow.

Innovation in the project will help to understand the convergence rate and computational complexities of active set methods which have not been fully addressed in the literature.  The algorithms and software developed in the project will not only benefit the research in computational optimization but also the investigations of new methods in broader areas of computational science. All the graduate and undergraduate students supported by this project will have opportunities to perform interdisciplinary research in both computational mathematics and data science.<br/><br/>Although interior point methods successfully solve optimization problems with excellent computational complexity, there are rarely global computational complexity results of active set methods for constrained optimization. This project develops practical, efficient and robust active set algorithms and software to solve the large-scale sparse optimization problems to high accuracy with both local fast convergence and global computational complexity guaranteed. In particular, by exploring the affine-scaling techniques and the second-order information the developed methods will have accelerated  asymptotic convergence speed, guaranteed global iteration complexity and converge to a (weak) second-order stationary point. In addition, by combining the approach with a generalized minimum eigenvalue procedure and a conjugate gradient method with negative curvature line search, the developed algorithm is expected to have excellent practical performance.

New species originated to replace those that went extinct, and the mollusk population remains quite diverse today. The cause of this great turnover in species has not been established. The primary hypothesis is that declining water temperatures pushed out warm-water-loving species and replaced them with those that could inhabit cooler waters. The researcher will produce robust, quantitative temperature estimates from sites up and down the East Coast over the past 3-5 million years and compare those to extinction patterns of marine mollusks to test this hypothesis. In addition to addressing the root cause of the extinction, these data will reveal information about the thermal tolerances of studied mollusk species and determine whether those are fixed or flexible (meaning a species could adapt to live in different water temperatures than it currently inhabits). This will have implications for the survival of mollusks living in American waters (including those farmed for aquaculture like clams and scallops) in the coming decades and centuries as ocean temperatures warm.

Still, they had never been directly observed before the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of black hole and neutron star binary systems by the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors in 2015. This detection heralded a major scientific transformation in the gravitational wave astrophysics field, which led to an urgent need for advanced computational models that will play a critical role in the future success of LIGO and upcoming space-borne missions like  Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. High-accuracy gravitational wave simulations are needed to produce the expected gravitational wave signal emitted from these systems over hundreds of thousands of orbital cycles, which are required to filter noisy data. The main objective of this project is to develop new computational techniques to accurately and efficiently simulate gravitational waves that will allow scientists to maximize the scientific output of current and future detectors. These efforts open a window into the universe and capture the interest of the general public as well as a younger generation of scientists. Previous research projects by the investigators have been discussed in the general media, and this work will continue to be successful in outreach to the general public. The computational skills that the students develop are broadly applicable and, therefore, would allow them access to various career options, including in areas of urgent national need.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop advanced mathematical and computational models to accurately simulate large-mass-ratio binary black hole systems, which are crucial for detecting gravitational waves. In particular, it will develop efficient and stable high-order methods that can handle the highly singular source terms of the s = ±2 Teukolsky model, including the development of a novel algorithm using a discontinuous Galerkin scheme and a mixed precision 2D weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme. Work will also focus on developing high-order, positivity-preserving time-stepping methods with minimized phase and dispersion errors to enhance the accuracy of the simulations. The research outcomes will significantly impact the field of gravitational wave discoveries by enabling the modeling of highly realistic astrophysical scenarios that were previously infeasible, such as systems in which both black holes are rapidly spinning in the extreme mass ratio limit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The models developed in this project and their use for predictive simulations of realistic scenarios will contribute to the knowledge supporting the plans to mitigate the effects, e.g., of permafrost thaw. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved and trained in computational mathematics as well as in an ability to contribute meaningfully and critically to the interdisciplinary efforts within and outside the project, with efforts towards an effective mentoring support structure for underrepresented groups.

This organization also plays a crucial role in the distribution of sound categories in the utterance, such as the location of stress and pitch movements, but speakers generally lack conscious access to this organization. The structure of syllables differs from language to language, and is one of the key ways in which languages differ from each other in speech sound patterns. Descriptions of pronunciation in the language of interest in this study have not agreed on how sounds are organized into syllables. Clarifying this matter via experimental methods provides insight into the sound patterns of this language, and how syllables vary across languages. The work also contributes to the development of educational resources in the language and to research capacity in higher education institutions in the region.<br/><br/>The study includes a series of five experiments with native speakers. In the first four experiments, the timing of speech production movements are tracked through acoustic and airflow measurements. Movements for sounds belonging to the same syllable are more tightly coordinated with each other than sounds belonging to different syllables. This variation in the temporal interdependence of sound events is used to determine which sounds belong to the same syllable. In the fifth experiment, speakers will produce tongue twisters under time pressure. Speakers under these conditions are expected to make many slips of the tongue, in particular errors in the location of consonants. It is known that consonants misplaced by mistake tend strongly to get misplaced to a comparable position in another syllable. The pattern of consonant ordering errors therefore provides evidence as to which consonants belong to the same syllable position.

With many computational tasks in biomedical or Earth sciences involving billions of degrees of freedom, model order reduction is necessary to scale the problem of interest down to a tractable size that fits onto the available computing platforms. Model order reduction techniques allow to construct a reduced order model (ROM) that retains the key features of a high-fidelity computational model while being much cheaper to simulate. Conventionally, a ROM represents a specific instance of the system and needs to be recomputed from scratch should the system experience significant changes to its properties. Thus, the question of constructing a ROM that captures the dependence of the system on its parameters arises. This is the main objective of the so-called parametric model reduction. Its main challenge is to develop efficient ROMs that can accurately predict solutions of parametrized high-fidelity models for parameter values that lie outside of the ""training"" set. The project will include training of graduate students.<br/><br/>This project aims at addressing the above-mentioned challenges by developing a ROM that extends the ideas of conventional projection-based model order reduction to parametric systems using the concepts and tools of modern numerical multi-linear algebra. The main techniques utilized are tensor decompositions, low-rank tensor approximation and completion. In particular, low-rank tensor approximations such as canonical polyadic, Tucker (a.k.a. high order SVD, HOSVD) and tensor train are employed in place of truncated SVD, a key conventional dimension-reduction technique. The resulting reduced model is referred to as tensorial ROM (TROM). The three main objectives of the project are: (1) developing a two-stage (training/evaluation) TROM for non-linear dynamical systems, including a tensor version of the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method; (2) developing novel low-rank tensor completion methods for use with TROM to ease the burden of the training stage by working with a sparse sampling of the parameter space; (3) integrating TROM into inverse modeling workflows, in particular, parameter estimation of the phase-field model for a multi-component lipid membrane modeled by surface Cahn-Hilliard equations, and quantitative imaging with waves for medical imaging and geophysical monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to establish rigorous mathematical results regarding the stability of boundary layers, building upon recent mathematical advances made by the principal investigator and collaborators in recent years. These mathematical results will inform a diverse range of scientific applications, e.g., by providing simpler reduced models which capture the qualitative behavior of boundary layer flows that can then be used to generate accurate fluid dynamics simulations. <br/><br/>This project is devoted to the rigorous mathematical analysis of boundary layers and the inviscid limit for two dimensional, stationary, incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Three regimes are identified for study which correspond to three different qualitative behaviors of the flow. The first regime will study the stability of globally laminar, self-similar boundary layers. These boundary layers have been confirmed to remarkable accuracy in experiments. The second regime is that of  reversed flows. These flows are observed after boundary layer separation. Mathematically, this regime will require the introduction of new techniques from mixed-type problems, free boundary problems, and many other PDE disciplines. The third regime consists of projects studying boundary layer separation, which is a singularity phenomenon observed in nature.

The research focuses on cleavage of chemical bonds that are ubiquitous in types of materials commonly used in medicine, agriculture, engineering, and commerce. During the course of these transformations, the key boron reagents are themselves degraded into innocuous boric acid ? a low toxicity chemical found in household products such as laundry detergent.

In addition to offering anticipated technological advancements in the areas of plastics recycling and PFAS remediation, the broader impacts of the funded project extend to the benefits accrued to society as Dr. Williams and her coworkers engage in a variety of activities to improve access to chemical education and to enhance the diversity, equity, and inclusion landscape at the University of Iowa. For example, continued development of a widely available smart phone-based app to facilitate undergraduate student learning in introductory organic chemistry courses is in progress and Dr. Williams is spearheading the creation of an American Chemical Society Women Chemist's Committee (ACS WCC) chapter at her institution.

New research is designed to expand understanding of the key parameters driving chemoselectivity in both C?F and C?O cleavage contexts, to explore novel (radical-based) mechanisms of reactivity that expand into C?H functionalization, and to evaluate the potential of these reactions for the aforementioned degradation of PFAS and epoxy resin plastics. A design of experiments (DoE) approach will be employed to reveal mechanistic and operational nuances not previously appreciated for the chemo- and regio-selective cleavage of ethereal bonds.

In the past, most of the equations are derived from basic physical laws and assumptions. With the advancement of technologies, abundant data are available from measurements and observations in many complex situations where the underlying model is not yet available or not accurate enough.

Integration with education at different levels will be designed to provide training for young computational mathematicians. <br/><br/>A data driven approach to PDE learning can provide a useful tool to discover new or more accurate quantitative models for complex systems and dynamics not only in traditional physical sciences but also in biological, social and other disciplines where basic principles and laws are not available but data are abundant.

Examples of shock waves abound in nature and technology: sonic booms generated by commercial and military airplanes, bow shocks generated by space vehicles upon re-entry through the atmosphere, and bow shocks created when the solar wind hits the planets, to name a few. Although a good theoretical understanding of the formation and subsequent propagation of shock waves exists for one-dimensional (i.e., planar) flows, the corresponding state of affairs in multiple space dimensions is much less satisfactory. The purpose of this project is to develop a  new geometric framework and a new mathematical description of the wave motion that allows for a detailed description of shock formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves in multiple space dimensions. This project will also offer research opportunities and collaborative experiences for graduate students and postdocs at the University of California, Davis, and New York University.<br/><br/>This project will develop the analytical and geometric framework for resolving one of the foremost unanswered questions in the fields of hyperbolic PDE and mathematical fluid dynamics: the formation and unique propagation of hydrodynamical shocks from smooth initial data, in multiple space dimensions. The first step is called ""shock formation"". Here the smooth initial data is evolved up to a cusp-like Eulerian spacetime hypersurface of first singularities, where the gradient of the velocity, pressure, density, and energy becomes infinite, but these fields retain Holder 1/3 regularity. The PIs approach to determining the location and the geometry of this cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities relies upon the construction of a smooth spacetime geometry, together and a new set of hydrodynamic variables in the Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) description of acoustic wave propagation. The second step is called ""shock development"" wherein one uses the analytical description of the solution on the cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities as Cauchy data, from which the shock surface of discontinuity instantaneously develops. In conjunction with the shock surface, we shall establish the emergence of so-called weak characteristic discontinuities; these are characteristic surfaces that emerge simultaneously (with the shock) from the pre-shock, and along which, gradients of velocity, density, and entropy exhibit one-sided Holder cusps. This framework enables the study of even more complicated physical models such as the magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD) of plasma flow. Here, unlike the lone classical compressive shock of gas dynamics, six different types of MHD shocks can be analyzed with our approach: a fast shock, a slow shock, and four different intermediate shocks. The latter were observed by the Voyager spacecraft in Earth?s heliosphere, but their mathematical existence, to date, remains in question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here the focus is on the study of symmetries of<br/>surfaces. Surprisingly, its geometry is to a large degree governed by<br/>hyperbolic geometry that goes back to Gauss, Lobacevski, Poincare and<br/>others. The goal is to better understand this phenomenon. The<br/>proposer's PhD students and postdoctoral researchers are also<br/>involved in parts of this investigation.<br/><br/>The most important result about the dynamics of classical mapping<br/>classes is the Nielsen-Thurston classification, which explains the<br/>behavior of iterates of simple closed curves. The same goal in the<br/>case of surfaces of infinite type looks to be much harder, but<br/>certainly worthy of a systematic study. The family of groups of proper<br/>homotopy equivalences of a locally finite graph is a sister family to<br/>the family of big mapping class groups, with many similarities and<br/>intriguing differences that the investigator wants to explore. More<br/>classically, the investigator wants to build ``towers'' of successive<br/>approximations to the classical mapping class group complexes, as well<br/>as complexes associated to automorphism groups of free groups, much<br/>like the Taylor series. The process of building these towers is called<br/>``disintegration'' and preliminary work shows that it succeeds for the<br/>arc and curve complexes and sheds new light on their large-scale<br/>geometry. This is yet another attempt to establish that the complexes<br/>associated with automorphism groups of free groups have finite<br/>asymptotic dimension, perhaps the main outstanding open question about<br/>the large-scale geometry of this group. The questions about ergodic<br/>measures could have been asked many years ago, but new methods are<br/>needed to answer them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aspects investigated in this project are the spatial structure of the motions, their dynamics, and how their associated vertical velocities connect the surface and bottom layers with the ocean?s interior. The exploration will be done combining multiple computer simulations focused in the Alboran Sea, the westernmost region of the Mediterranean basin.

This project intends to expand on the previous results by scrutinizing the evolution of submesoscale motions. The study is based on the hypothesis, based on previous results, that the largest vertical velocities in the study area are associated to surface fronts and to interactions of the currents with bottom topography. Results from this study should contribute to better understanding of the vertical transport of materials in the ocean.

Furthermore, the extreme internal conditions predicted for these next-generation nuclear reactors have led to considerable interest in the development of novel metal alloys capable of withstanding high temperatures, mechanical stresses, and radiation damage. This proposal is exploring the behavior of a new class of metal alloys, called complexion-containing alloys, that promise exceptional stability under high temperatures and radiation due to their unique structure. Cutting-edge microscopy techniques are being utilized to examine the structural changes caused by radiation and determine the feasibility of using complexion-containing alloys within the extreme environment of next-generation nuclear reactors. In addition, this project incorporates opportunities for community engagement, such as participation in Research Experiences for Undergraduates Programs, collaborations with existing programs at the University of California, Santa Barbara that cater to students from underrepresented communities in STEM, and the development of a website for disseminating education resources for immigrant student/researchers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project explores the fundamental mechanisms that govern thermal stability and radiation tolerance in novel nanocrystalline complexion-containing alloys. Targeted ion irradiation studies coupled with in-situ testing tools in high-resolution transmission electron microscopes are being utilized to investigate the influence of ion irradiation induced damage on complexions and the subsequent implications for material properties exhibited during, and post-, irradiation. The objectives of the proposed research are: (a) design and create a model nanocrystalline alloy containing complexions, (b) probe microstructural changes pre- and post-irradiation as a function of temperature and dose to explore the influence of radiation defects on complexion behavior, and (c) utilize a suite of in-situ irradiation, heating, and mechanical testing techniques to develop an understanding of the underlying mechanisms through real-time visualization. In addition to its research endeavors, this proposal is expanding opportunities for underrepresented communities in STEM fields through mentoring opportunities at the undergraduate level, education programs for K-12 schools, and providing educational resources for immigrant student/researchers, with a particular focus on expanding educational and research pathways between the U.S. and Brazil.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop private algorithms for several fundamental problems in graph mining and network science, that can scale to networks of the size that arise in real-world applications and provide good accuracy bounds.

Currently, predictions are hampered by incomplete knowledge about the role of soils in climate change. Soils harbor more carbon than the atmosphere and all global vegetation combined. As microbes decompose soil carbon, they release CO2?a greenhouse gas?to the atmosphere. Globally, this process produces 10 times as much CO2 each year than fossil fuel burning. How microbes adapt to increasing temperatures is not well-understood and thus, their contribution to the greenhouse effect as temperatures rise is not clear. Also, microbes reproduce quickly, and it is not clear if they will evolve to produce more or less CO2 as climate change progresses. Few studies have conducted evolution experiments to address this question, and none have evolved microbes in outdoor ecosystems within an intact microbial community. In this research project, certain species of fungi and bacteria will be exposed to extreme warming, either in isolation, or with the natural microbial community, to determine whether microbes evolve better tools, such as biofilms, in a natural microbial community, and whether adaptation results in maintenance or increase in soil carbon decomposition rates under extreme warming, which would potentially accelerate climate change. Broader impacts include training of undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral scholars. The PIs will also develop a middle school educational module that includes hands-on activities to learn about microbes and climate change. Middle-school students and teachers from low-income and underrepresented populations will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>In the real world, soil fungi and bacteria will not adapt to climate change in isolation. In fact, fungi and bacteria often interact to form multi-species biofilms. In this project, eco-evolutionary mechanisms of biofilm formation in response to extreme warming will be examined and how this will impact large-scale organic C decomposition will be studied. This research will thus provide a deeper understanding of how soil microbes adapt to climate change, and, thus, improve predictions under future climate scenarios. The PIs hypothesize that fungi and bacteria will adapt to extreme warming more effectively if they interact with one another. Specifically, extreme warming will select for biofilm formation because extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of biofilms can buffer microbes from heat damage. In addition, adaptation to extreme warming within multi-species biofilms will result in faster organic C decomposition since EPS can improve the longevity and efficiency of organic C-degrading enzymes in the environment. Thousands of generations of bacterial and fungal strains will be exposed to extreme warming in the field while manipulating their interactions with the whole microbial community and controlling their ability to form multi-species biofilms. To focus on mechanisms underlying adaptation, computer-based ecosystem modeling and lab studies with the same experimental design as the field will be performed. In each case, growth rate, survivorship, biofilm formation, and organic C decomposition under extreme warming will be monitored. This project will also assess EPS production in soil samples from NEON sites which represent many different terrestrial habitats with a wide range of environmental conditions, thus broadening the generalizability of the research.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by Integrative Organismal Systems and the Division of Environmental Biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rowan of the University of Chicago is developing synthetic methodologies for the preparation of poly[n]catenanes and poly[n]rotaxanes.  Catenanes and rotaxanes consist of two or more components that are interlocked together and held in place by the mechanical bond.  Catenanes are comprised of interlocked rings while rotaxanes consist of a ring that is interlocked with a dumbbell (a thread-like molecule with stoppers on either end large enough to prevent dethreading of the ring) component.  Macromolecular or polymeric versions of these species are particularly intriguing as they offer new polymeric architectures in which the relative motions of the different components allow access to new and unique properties.  While architectures such as poly[2]catenanes and main-chain poly[n]rotaxanes have been prepared, synthetic methodologies to poly[n]catenanes and doubly threaded slide ring gels have received much less attention.  In such architectures, the mechanical bond is part of the polymer backbone and allows the macromolecules to expand/contract without significant activation energy. As a result, such polymers can exhibit unusual viscoelastic properties.  This research will explore new synthetic protocols that will allow access to these intriguing macromolecules.  The proposed research will mix different disciplines within the chemistry arena, from synthetic organic and metal coordination chemistry to polymer science and characterization. This integrated research approach will provide students at all levels with broad educational experiences covering these topics. Additionally, the integrated high school and undergraduate research and outreach activities will be designed to increase the fraction of underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. Specifically, the planned activities will involve high school students from Chicago?s south side.  <br/><br/>This research will focus on developing synthetic routes to new interlocked polymers based on catenanes and rotaxanes.  A strong emphasis will be placed on synthetic methodologies that utilize metal-ligand coordination as the thermodynamic driving force to preorganize the organic components, followed by a covalent fixing either through ring-closing metathesis to access the poly[n]catenanes, or high-yielding, catalyst-free click chemistries to access the doubly-threaded slide ring gels.  This project will also provide systematic investigation on how the structure of the building components can be used to impact product distribution, molecular weight, as well as the resulting properties of these unique polymers.  Results associated with this work have the potential to advance polymer chemistry by addressing fundamental questions about mechanical linkages in polymeric systems.  Moreover, doubly-threaded slide ring gels are expected to be of broad scientific interest as they serve both as models of networks with trapped entanglements as well as potential sources of materials with unusual mechanical and functional properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, integration is used to mathematically express the total quantity of a substance, such as a hazardous chemical, over a given spatial region (or domain). However, the integration problems in these models can rarely be solved by pen and paper techniques, so researchers must employ numerical integration, or quadrature, methods. This project introduces an entirely new framework, Fredholm Alternative Quadrature (FAQ), for performing the essential task of quadrature. It thus gives researchers new effective options for tackling integration problems, especially those involving geometrically complicated domains and irregularly sampled data. The framework also offers a new approach to a classical subject that has been around for millennia, providing fresh insights and pedagogical opportunities. The project will support one Ph.D. student in the recently created computational math, science, & engineering (CMSE) program, which will also help bolster the research portfolio of this program. Building from a successful track record of recruiting graduate students in computational mathematics from underrepresented groups, the investigator will continue working with the Institute for Inclusive and Transformative Scholarship to help identify potential candidates for the project. New educational opportunities for undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D. students will also be created through the development of a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) that incorporates topics from the project.<br/><br/>The FAQ framework is based on a relationship between the continuous Fredholm Alternative (FA) theorem for Poisson's equation and the discrete FA for linear systems that arise from discretizing this equation. It does not employ integration but instead requires discretizing certain Laplace operators at a given set of points over the integration domain and solving an eigenvalue problem. To maximize the flexibility and practicality of FAQ, the mesh-free radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) method for discretizing the Laplace operators will be used. This results in a method that 1) does not require explicitly or implicitly integrating basis functions, 2) can be used on geometrically complicated domains (even surfaces), 3) can be implemented for scattered samples of the integrand without meshing, 4) can yield high orders of accuracy for smooth functions, and 5) can be computed efficiently. Several numerical and theoretical advancements will also be made, including techniques for producing high-order accurate RBF-FD discretizations, efficient meshfree multilevel methods for computing the FAQ formulas, least squares techniques for enhancing the stability of FAQ formulas, tools for analyzing FAQ approximation properties, and new insights on classical quadrature formulas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of shock waves abound in nature and technology: sonic booms generated by commercial and military airplanes, bow shocks generated by space vehicles upon re-entry through the atmosphere, and bow shocks created when the solar wind hits the planets, to name a few. Although a good theoretical understanding of the formation and subsequent propagation of shock waves exists for one-dimensional (i.e., planar) flows, the corresponding state of affairs in multiple space dimensions is much less satisfactory. The purpose of this project is to develop a  new geometric framework and a new mathematical description of the wave motion that allows for a detailed description of shock formation and the subsequent dynamics of shock waves. This project will also offer research opportunities and collaborative experiences for graduate students and postdocs at the University of California, Davis, and New York University.<br/><br/>This project will develop the analytical and geometric framework for resolving one of the foremost unanswered questions in the fields of hyperbolic PDE and mathematical fluid dynamics: the formation and unique propagation of hydrodynamical shocks from smooth initial data, in multiple space dimensions. The first step is called ""shock formation"". Here the smooth initial data is evolved up to a cusp-like Eulerian spacetime hypersurface of first singularities, where the gradient of the velocity, pressure, density, and energy becomes infinite, but these fields retain Holder 1/3 regularity. The PIs approach to determining the location and the geometry of this cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities relies upon the construction of a smooth spacetime geometry, together and a new set of hydrodynamic variables in the Arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) description of acoustic wave propagation. The second step is called ""shock development"" wherein one uses the analytical description of the solution on the cusp-like spacetime hypersurface of first singularities as Cauchy data, from which the shock surface of discontinuity instantaneously develops. In conjunction with the shock surface, we shall establish the emergence of so-called weak characteristic discontinuities; these are characteristic surfaces that emerge simultaneously (with the shock) from the pre-shock, and along which, gradients of velocity, density, and entropy exhibit one-sided Holder cusps. This framework enables the study of even more complicated physical models such as the magnetohydrodynamic equations (MHD) of plasma flow. Here, unlike the lone classical compressive shock of gas dynamics, six different types of MHD shocks can be analyzed with our approach: a fast shock, a slow shock, and four different intermediate shocks. The latter were observed by the Voyager spacecraft in Earth?s heliosphere, but their mathematical existence, to date, remains in question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large fraction is for single-use applications. Consequently, more than 25 million metric tons of plastic are annually discarded into terrestrial environments. Bio-based plastics produced from readily renewable carbon sources (i.e., corn) are increasingly being used as substitutes for legacy plastics sourced from fossil fuels. Bio-based plastics are advantageous because their carbon is converted from atmospheric CO2 instead of petroleum. Furthermore, some of these plastics are designed to biodegrade in bioactive environments. All plastics are broken down in the environment by chemical and physical processes into smaller microplastics (less than 5 mm in size) that may become accessible to microorganisms and utilized for their life function or survival. The fate of microplastic residues depends on their degradation in the environment. This research tracks the degradation of microplastic particles of polylactic acid (PLA, a bio-based plastic) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, a petroleum-based plastic) in soils, where their slow decomposition can lead to plastic accumulation. The research exploits unique carbon isotopic ?tags? naturally inherent or artificially introduced to plastics to quantify decomposition with imaging and microbial community analysis to identify how degradation is occurring. The main goal of the work is to monitor the transferal of the isotopic tags to microbial biomass, and eventually, the carbon dioxide and/or methane gas microbes produce or ?exhale?. The research is important because it will expand society?s limited understanding of how plastics impact soil health and function, and natural earth processes (i.e., carbon cycling) given plastics? potential to alter the natural emission of climate warming gases like carbon dioxide and methane in soil systems. Bringing the science of microplastics to a diverse community is a priority of the research team. The project involves and supports secondary, undergraduate, and graduate level students that will be co-mentored by a multidisciplinary faculty team. Students will be involved in research objectives and trained in communicating science to the public. Importantly, students will gain experience across three increasingly related fields for solving the plastic pollution crisis: geochemistry, analytical chemistry, and polymer/green chemistry.<br/><br/>Microplastic decomposition occurs through synergistic abiotic weathering of the plastic and key enzymatic and/or microbial interactions. Due to their acclimation to anthropogenic waste, it is hypothesized that the soil microbiome will assimilate and mineralize microplastics, and that natural soil processes like physical mixing and chemical hydrolysis will promote the integration of soil plastics within aggregates and affect the overall assimilation and mineralization of soil organic carbon and plastics by the soil microbiome. The hypotheses will be tested in controlled soil microcosms by utilizing naturally abundant and isotopically labeled (synthesized) polymers that are experimentally degraded and exposed to soils and their native microbiome. Isotopic labels offer an approach to identify assimilation and/or mineralization since they will separate these and other competing processes and/or those that may be impractical to measure in a short period. The incorporation of the plastics? isotope label will be monitored via phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers and final mineralization gases (i.e., carbon dioxide and methane) using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Spectroscopy based approaches (i.e., synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy) will account for the plastics? reactivity and association with soil aggregates. The combination of stable isotopic, spectral, and isotopic mass balance approaches will establish a fundamental understanding of plastic decomposition, and include a modeling of their assimilation and mineralization, transformation to lower weight products, and final conversion to carbon dioxide and methane in soils. This research will further basic science understanding of physical, chemical, and biological processes in soils and address a topic of great current practical interest in environmental geochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports a combined experimental and computational project that will reveal the biomechanical principles that govern the assembly and organization of cells in epithelial tissue by studying spherical cell monolayers (called acini), which spontaneously collapse and evert polarity (i.e., where the acinus turns itself inside out) when induced to become more contractile. The final everted state is relevant to organoid applications where outer exposure of the apical surface is desired, and it also resembles acinar gland abnormalities in cancer. The knowledge gained from this study will be valuable to fundamental understanding of tissue development as well as control of the structure of cultured organoids. Thus, this project has broad potential impact on advancing human health, as the findings will be directly relevant to establishing the mechanical principles of tissue organization and development.

A three-dimensional vertex-based mathematical model will be used to model the interacting cell population in the monolayer, accounting for the surface tensions and curvatures of the apical and basal cell surfaces and the cell-cell interfacial tension. The model will also account for the roles of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in the surface forces and interfacial energies. These parameters will be perturbed experimentally while tracking the 3D morphology of the acinus surfaces via high resolution confocal microscopy. The second objective is to understand how the acinus is perturbed from the equilibrium state and driven to contract and evert to a state of everted polarity, testing the hypothesis that the difference between and apical and basal surface tensions is the mechanical driving force for eversion. The eversion process will be simulated using a dynamic vertex/finite element model accounting for cell contractile and viscous forces, and it will be experimentally tested by triggering eversion via chemical perturbations (e.g. actomyosin activation, inhibition of ECM adhesion) and by laser ablation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the primary proposed research efforts in this project include three main components: (i) to develop a systematic understanding of the stability property of different components of inverse operators and design corresponding weighted optimization schemes to focus on such components in the learning process; (ii) to develop a general computational framework to couple the complementary benefits of learning and classical iterative reconstruction methods; and (iii) to characterize the impact of learning uncertainty on the reconstruction results from new data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The northernmost of these wind gaps is the ?Tehuantepec Gap? (along the southwest coast of Mexico). These locally known winds (here simply Tehuantepec Gap Winds) drive intense upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich water in the Gulf primarily in the winter when high atmospheric pressures over North America establish a pressure gradient across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Despite the potential importance of the Tehuantepec Gap Winds as an Atlantic-Pacific teleconnection, there has been no attempt to predict the response of these winds to changes in regional climate dynamics in the context of rapid and global climate change. The researchers suggest to combine past climate records of upwelling (from sedimentary radiocarbon over the last 30.000 years) and model simulations to characterize atmospheric dynamical processes over the North Atlantic, and to examine both the sensitivity of these winds to ?upstream? factors as well as the ?downstream? implications of this inter-basin coupling. A novel Atlantic-Pacific Ocean-atmosphere feedback mechanism is suggesting in the methodological framework and hypothesis testing of this project in which the Tehuantepec Gap Winds and atmospheric Rossby waves play a central role. This collaborative project will support two early career scientists, and the education and scientific training of undergraduate students at UC Irvine (both a Hispanic Serving Institution and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution). The researchers will continue engagement in their institution? broadening participation efforts, including ATOC REU in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Cryospheric Sciences (NSF 2150262), a program that primarily recruits from Hispanic Serving Institutions to introduce students to data science and geoscience research. Additionally, a lesson plan focused on long-term variations in Earth?s climate will be developed as part of this project and piloted through Environmental Climate Change and Literacy Projects in California?s outreach programs and posted in an openly available national online repository for climate pedagogy (called ?Subject to Climate?).<br/><br/>The Gulf of Tehuantepec is an ideal location to characterize ?upstream? atmospheric processes linking the Pacific and Atlantic sectors because a prominent gap in the Sierra Madre mountains forces low-level winds to flow through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec toward the Pacific, driving local upwelling of deeper, lower radiocarbon waters to the surface. A preliminary model results and sediment core measurements leverage this wind-to-radiocarbon relationship to provide a precious constraint on Northern Hemisphere atmospheric dynamics over the past 23,000-years. Previous studies of contemporary climate variability and preliminary examinations of models and observational products indicate that higher atmospheric pressure over North America is associated with high near-surface pressure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to stronger Tehuantepec winds. The project suggested here?including new sediment proxy measurements, model (Paleoclimate GCM) and data product examinations, and forward modeling?aims to discover the driving mechanisms behind the variability in Tehuantepec gap wind strength over paleoclimate timescales, which will provide a crucial new constraint on glacial-interglacial atmospheric dynamics in addition to controls on tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperature and inter-basin moisture fluxes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Bryan Ramirez-Corona is ?Duckweed as a multiplexable model to study signal integration with advanced genomic tools.? The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Washington and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Josh Cuperus.<br/><br/>Plants form the basis of the food webs that sustain animal life. Climate change and the loss of arable land threaten to drastically reduce agricultural output and negatively affect food security. Understanding plant molecular responses to environmental stressors will be important for building resilient crops capable of sustaining future generations. Existing plant models limit our ability to understand how plants respond to stressors because they cannot test large numbers of conditions efficiently. This work aims to solve existing limitations by measuring plant environmental responses in the smallest and fastest-growing plant family, duckweed. This work will generate tools and information on duckweed that will enable other research groups to study plant biology at a larger scale, speeding up the rate of discovery. Technical and non-technical expertise gained over the course of this research will prepare Bryan for establishing and maintaining an independent research program focused on plant biology. This research will also serve as a background for individual and lab-level equity and inclusion efforts. These efforts include the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general public by leveraging existing social media outlets and the directed mentorship of diverse students through summer research programs.<br/><br/>In nature, plants must be content with complex combinations of environmental inputs, such as temperature, light, acidity, and nutrient availability. However, traditional plant models are relatively large and slow growing, making it difficult to study their transcriptional responses to these inputs. To study how plants modulate cell-type-specific transcriptional responses to combinations of inputs, duckweed will be used as a scalable experimental model. Duckweed species are both the smallest and fastest-growing flowering plants and contain homologous structures to terrestrial plants. Their small size enables them to be grown in a 96-well format, allowing for the testing of many combinations of environmental inputs. This work will establish a dataset of control and condition-specific single-cell gene expression (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq and FIBER-seq). Three duckweed species will be tested under single and combinatorial treatments of temperature, pH, NO3-, NH4+, and H2PO4-. This work will also establish CRISPR/CAS9 expressing lines for facile targeted mutagenesis. All sequencing data, transgenic lines, and plasmids will be made publicly available through NCBI Sequencing Read Archive, Rutgers Duckweed Stock Cooperative, and Addgene, respectively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Perovskite solar cells are emerging photovoltaic devices and have recently achieved power conversion efficiencies exceeding 25 percent. A critical component of perovskite solar cells is a transparent conductive oxide thin film of about 100 nanometer thickness, which acts as the top electrode to collect the photocurrent while allowing light to pass through. The perovskite layer underneath the top electrode is heat-sensitive and demands room-temperature deposition of the transparent conductive film. However, oxide thin films grown at room temperature by conventional magnetron sputtering ? the standard industrial technology used for manufacturing thin films ? have amorphous structures that result in poor electrical conductivity and low optical transmittance. This challenge has become a critical barrier limiting the energy conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells. This project advances the knowledge of plasma discharges to enable ion-beam-enhanced soft sputtering, which permits room-temperature growth of highly transparent and conductive oxide thin films that significantly enhance solar cell efficiency and performance. The broad use of renewable energy supports a sustainable economy and addresses global environmental concerns. This project integrates multidisciplinary research and training activities for graduate and undergraduate students and prepares them for a highly skilled future workforce. Besides advanced manufacturing, the project advances the field of plasma physics. This award also supports NSF's ECosystem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE) program.<br/><br/>Highly transparent and conductive oxide thin films, such as indium-tin-oxide (ITO), have polycrystalline structures that could not be formed under off-phase-equilibrium conditions at low temperatures in classical physical vapor deposition. This research aims to validate the hypothesis that the interactions of an ion beam with the surface atoms are equivalent to localized heating at the atomic scale. Realizing effective ion-atom interactions requires overcoming the scientific barriers to creating a high-density soft low energy ion beam that is effectively coupled with magnetron sputtering. This research fills the knowledge gap on the energy distributions of the ion beam and the sputtered atoms under the coupled plasma discharges. The research team performs self-consistent particle-in-cell Monte Carlo simulations of the beam plasma source and magnetron sputtering, develops a model to elucidate the mutually enhanced ion-film and ion-target interactions, establishes the relationships between the plasma parameters and the resulting film microstructures and properties, and demonstrates high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, prescribed burning can be impeded by a lack of funding, preparation, and technical guidance. Furthermore, management of prescribed burning operations involves interdependent decision-makers and stakeholders (e.g., governments, fire departments, environmental agencies, insurance companies, and private land/property owners) often with conflicting values and objectives. Motivated by the gaps in current knowledge in this domain, and the need for insights that can improve and support field operations, this project will quantify the impact of the prescribed burning usage in mitigating wildland fires. It aims at generating new datasets and models for better planning prescribed burns, which would in turn save lives and reduce the economic losses in hazard-prone regions. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to create novel analytical models to quantify the impact of prescribed burning programs for mitigating the losses and damages caused by wildland fires.

However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the rate and extent of contributing factors like sea level rise and the resulting changes in the hazards themselves, such as increases in the average intensity of tropical cyclones. This uncertainty leaves policymakers unsure of what conditions to plan for, leading to the possibility of catastrophes if the future turns out to be more extreme than expected. On the other hand, preparing for a worst-case scenario that never comes to pass may require overinvestment of scarce resources that could have been allocated to other societal and economic concerns. Research also shows that socially vulnerable and marginalized communities bear a disproportionate share of risks associated with natural hazards. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant is to improve decision-makers' ability to manage risk from extreme events by (i) better quantifying natural hazards risks and (ii) identifying risk-informed, adaptive, and equitable management strategies.<br/><br/>While the tools and methods developed during this project will be applicable to multiple natural hazards, the scope and motivation of the project are to develop, validate, and apply them in the context of storm surge, riverine, and pluvial (i.e., rainfall) flooding in coastal Louisiana. Unique datasets and state-of-the-art modeling capabilities will be leveraged to better characterize the joint risk of flooding from these sources and predict how the hazard will evolve over time under shifting landscapes (e.g., land subsidence, erosion, changes to vegetation associated with saltwater intrusion) and climate change-related environmental forcings (e.g., sea level rise, changes to tropical cyclone characteristics). A multi-resolution, multi-model framework and artificial intelligence will permit estimation of compound flood hazard in a large ensemble of future scenarios, which will then be applied to an existing structure-level risk model used in Louisiana?s Coastal Master Plan. Adaptive risk management strategies that balance economic efficiency and equity, and which are robust to uncertainties and varied operational definitions of equity, will be identified using methods for decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU). Educational components of the project will focus on increasing the adoption of DMDU methods and risk analysis, and helping STEM students and practitioners to translate natural hazards research into real-world policy impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current exoskeletons often do not account for the interaction between the wearer and the robot, relying on pre-planned walking motions. This Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project aims to spur research into the development of real-time, personalized locomotion strategies for lower limb exoskeletons. The outcomes of this research could lead to safer and more compliant rehabilitation robotic systems.<br/><br/>In this project, autonomous locomotion planning and impedance control strategies will be designed and implemented with two challenging purposes: 1) online shaping of personalized walking trajectory to enhance human comfort and 2) real-time adjustment of the exoskeleton impedance during human-robot interaction. Accordingly, intelligent control strategies will be developed for lower-limb exoskeletons to facilitate a balance between exoskeleton autonomy and human safety, which is technically challenging due to the non-passive and unpredictable behaviors of humans that make the detection of their intention and ensuring the flexibility of the exoskeleton's response harder. The control strategies that will be pursued in this research project will advance the trending interdisciplinary research on various lower-limb human robot interaction tasks such as movement therapies, assistive locomotion, and human behavior assessment augmented by an exoskeleton. Accordingly, this research will advance the field of assistive robotics to have a widespread impact on the quality of life for a variety of people with disabilities and neurological conditions caused by spinal cord injury, stroke, and other injuries/diseases.

Wind tunnel testing remains the most common approach for assessing wind loads on structures and informing wind resistant design to reduce the cost of damage. However, wind tunnel experiments have limitations, such as the measurement resolution and the challenge of obtaining simultaneous records of wind velocity and pressure fields. Numerical simulations, such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), offer an opportunity to fill in these gaps, but such simulation capabilities are currently not optimally leveraged by the research community. An important barrier is that current numerical modeling capabilities are mostly tailored to stationary, standard neutral wind profiles; in contrast, wind tunnels such as the BLWT at UF are increasingly implementing advanced capabilities to reproduce more complex turbulent wind fields that cause structural damage. This research project will establish numerical simulation capabilities for these complex wind fields. To maximize the potential impact of the project, validation test cases and a corresponding digital twin tool set and tutorial for the simulation capabilities will be defined through structured interviews with the current UF BLWT user base. The resulting digital twin capability will make it possible to jointly leverage numerical and experimental models to improve understanding of the turbulent wind loads that drive damage to buildings and civil infrastructure and to advance wind resilient design. Simulation data and documented source codes will be archived and made publicly available in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). This EAGER will contribute to the NSF role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. <br/><br/>The specific goal of the research is to establish and disseminate a numerical modeling strategy for reproducing complex turbulent wind fields generated in the UF BLWT. For standard neutral log-law wind fields, inflow boundary conditions commonly employ artificial turbulence generation methods. Since the velocity statistics of artificial turbulence evolve within the computational domain, some form of calibration is required to ensure that the target wind field is correctly reproduced. This calibration challenge is exacerbated when the objective is to model more complex turbulent wind fields, such as the boundary layer with a pronounced roughness sublayer that can be produced in the UF BLWT, which is important for low-rise buildings, where the building is immersed in the roughness sublayer (the roughness height of the boundary layer is on the order of the building height). The first objective of this project is to explore computationally efficient and accurate methods for numerically reproducing these roughness sublayers. Different combinations of artificial turbulence inflow generators, upstream roughness resolving simulations, source term forcing methods, and machine learning approaches will be investigated and validated against experimental data. The second objective of this project is to support broad dissemination of the resulting turbulence generation method by co-designing a digital twin tool set and a tutorial with the BLWT user base. The digital wind tunnel can also help identify optimal measurement locations for physical testing and potentially support data infilling where there are limits on the spatial resolution of physical measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, the formation of solid-like gels at water-oil interfaces during oil recovery processes can be unfavorable because gel build-up can clog wells and pipelines. On the other hand, gel formation can actually be beneficial in flow diversion processes by diverting the flow away from porous rocks and enhancing oil recovery. The interface dynamics and morphologies of this open system cannot be predicted solely by an equilibrium phase diagram, and mathematical models and numerical simulations are needed to fully characterize the nonlinear, out-of-equilibrium dynamics.  This project aims to establish a computational framework for models of non-equilibrium phenomena, and design algorithms and experiments to investigate the interface dynamics of complex, reactive fluids. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training for students, and research activities will help develop the next generation of mathematicians, scientists and engineers. The team of PIs consists of the three researchers from three different institutions, where training of graduate students on the topics of the project is expected. <br/><br/>Studies of two or more fluids that are reactive, and flow through a porous medium, are fundamental to many fields. At equilibrium, the mixture may behave like a liquid or a gel (viscoelastic solid) depending on the concentrations of the components according to an equilibrium phase diagram.

This project builds upon breakthroughs in modeling, computation, and experimental techniques to develop a unified mathematical framework that resolves the interface dynamics of reactive fluids driven out of equilibrium. Thermodynamically consistent equations governing the non-equilibrium dynamics of ternary reacting systems of immiscible fluids will be derived, focusing on the radial Hele-Shaw geometry as a prototype.

Advancement in thermoelectric technology depends on identifying new materials with high efficiency by using novel approaches to design new materials to minimize strong interdependency between different features, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient. These include large dataset screening and advanced thermodynamic, electronic, and structural property investigations. Using high-throughput density functional theory calculations and cluster expansion methods, the PI and her team will investigate whether self-assembled nanostructures based on topological materials can be found that would allow electron and phonon transport decoupling to improve thermoelectric efficiency. The main idea is to find appropriate matching materials with a small energy barrier and lattice continuity between the nanostructure and the parent material, which would help in retaining high carrier mobility while scattering phonons to enhance thermoelectric performance.

Joint decomposition of these datasets, arranged as matrices or tensors, provides an attractive solution to data fusion by letting them fully interact and inform each other and yields factor matrices that are directly interpretable, where the resulting factors (components) are directly associated with quantities of interest. This research will provide a powerful solution for inference from large-scale data by effectively summarizing the heterogeneity in large datasets through the definition of homogeneous subspaces such that components within a subspace are highly dependent. The success of the methods will be demonstrated through identification of homogeneous subgroups of subjects from neuroimaging data, thus enabling personalized medicine whose goal is to tailor intervention strategies for a given individual. Effectively summarizing information in large-scale datasets is at the heart of many of today's challenging problems, hence the new set of tools will impact numerous areas in science and technology, including those in medical imaging, remote sensing, image/video processing, communications, and social networks.<br/><br/>Independent vector analysis (IVA) and coupled tensor factorizations are two powerful ways for working with spatio-temporal data, each exploiting the structural/dependence information through different mechanisms. They also provide strong uniqueness guarantees, which is key for interpretability. This project leverages the complementary strengths of IVA and coupled tensor decompositions to develop a powerful framework for joint analysis/fusion of a large number of datasets through automated identification of homogeneous subspaces along with the components within these subspaces. This is accomplished by initially developing effective solutions to the problem with IVA and with coupled tensor decompositions, working in parallel. Then, in a second stage, the connections between these two approaches are established, both in terms of methods and uniqueness conditions, to develop a methodology that leverages the strengths of both approaches. The emphasis on uniqueness and interpretability of the solutions together with an application to a challenging dataset will ensure that the methods, as well as the developed theoretical foundations, are not only complete but also practically useful. Another important aspect of the work is the establishing of bridges across two communities that do not necessarily communicate. The work will demonstrate that statistically and algebraically motivated approaches to data fusion are not in competition with each other but have important complementary aspects that can be effectively leveraged.

The resulting shapes can be smooth like the undulating edge of a flower, or sharp like the creases and points in a crumpled ball of foil. The goal of this research is to understand when these features turn out to be smooth versus when they are sharp. This deceptively simple question is surprisingly difficult to answer, and it impacts a variety of technologies that rely on thin sheets. This project consists of a suite of model experiments where polymer films are forced into different geometries, forcing them to buckle. Because the project focuses on physical behaviors that should be scale-free, our discoveries should be applicable to material systems ranging from the very small to the very large, from graphene films to food packaging to deployable satellites. The research is coupled to a set of education and outreach projects that target a wide range of audiences. The project will train two PhD students who will work with undergraduates and high school students in the lab. The work will also engage high school teachers from Central New York, who will conduct 6-week summer research internships. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Despite the ubiquity of sheets in our everyday lives and their importance to a range of technologies, we nevertheless lack a general predictive framework for when a buckled sheet will have a smooth or sharp character. The overarching goal of the project is to measure, quantify, and predict when an elastic film will form sharp, singular features where stresses and strains spontaneously condense to a small set. The project focuses on situations where there are no applied tensile loads to organize the buckling patterns. One set of experiments will use a stamping setup where a thin sheet is confined in the gap between two curved walls. A second set of experiments will investigate the buckling of an ultrathin spherical cap confined to a liquid bath. The buckling patterns range from smooth concentric circular wrinkles, to smectic domains of parallel wrinkles separated by sharp grain boundaries. The project will characterize the transitions between these morphologies while pursuing a tantalizing link to a polygonalization transition in indented shells. This research lies at the intersections of physics, applied mathematics, and engineering, and the project engages with general themes in condensed matter including singularities, symmetry breaking, and order-disorder transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plume pulsing contributes to changes in the height of oceanic gateways that link Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland. These gateways control the amount of cold, deep water that has flowed from the Norwegian Sea to the Atlantic ocean over the past few million years. This project will examine the history of plume activity and ocean circulation in the North Atlantic region using data from rock cores collected deep beneath the seabed. The outcomes of this project will have immediate impact upon our knowledge of past ocean circulation and climate, which is key to addressing the environmental challenges that society is confronting today. Broader impacts include participation in workshops for local teachers, delivery of K-12 activities, development of a first year Earth systems class, and support for a post-doctoral scholar and graduate students.<br/><br/>The flanks of Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland lie above one of Earth?s largest plume-ridge systems, and are covered by rapidly accumulating contourite drift sediments that are sensitive to the oceanographic conditions influenced by adjacent deep-water gateways.

This project will investigate the extent to which the Iceland mantle plume has controlled oceanic gateways and deep-water circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean during Cenozoic times. Samples and data collected at sites on Björn and Gardar contourite drifts during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 395 provide an opportunity to significantly advance our understanding of the history of sedimentation patterns and ocean circulation across the North Atlantic region. Kinematic and paleobathymetric models for ocean basin evolution will be integrated with sediment accumulation rate and current speed estimates from recently drilled cores, as tools to decipher past ocean circulation patterns.

Each of these might sound completely unrelated, but the main idea behind the project is that similar methods from harmonic analysis and optimization can be applied to each of these problems when viewed through the right lens. A substantial part of the project will be performed in collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, towards developing theoretical and computational tools, while at the same time maintaining and creating new collaborations with physicists, especially in terms of applications. Special attention will be paid to working with numerical analysts at the forefront of simulating problems in each application domain.<br/><br/><br/>Algorithms for solving complicated problems in physics, fluid mechanics and data analysis will be considered, with a special focus on quantifiable error estimates and rigorous constructions of various fundamental modes or resonances for physically important examples. For instance, the principal investigator will extend work that was performed with collaborators on solving the Helmholtz problem using domain decompositions to give further quantitative bounds on numerical schemes for obstacle scattering, in similar way to the cases of scattering by inhomogeneous media.  This will give enhanced error estimates for numerical solutions to the Helmholtz equation, which play a major role in various applications for inverse problems in medical imaging, sonar detection, and more.  In particular, although numerical simulations are by nature constrained to certain bounded domains, one can understand how to provide damping of a fluid at certain points to allow for a numerical simulation of the way a wave propagates in the open ocean without getting effects from the boundary.  This is done by adding a ?damping term? that could perturb the system in a significant way.  However, upon performing a certain transformation, the essence of this damping lies in computing properties of operators that arise in quantum mechanics with complex potentials. The complex and rich tools that have been recently developed in microlocal analysis, optimization and elliptic theory of partial differential equations allow us to give strong insights and new means of establishing quantitative bounds.  These apply to the efficacy of damped fluid models, as well as to questions related to the behavior of a light wave in a crystalline structure with defects.

The black hole is 4 million times the mass of the Sun. It was first identified by radio emission from hot gas orbiting near it. The brightness of the black hole regions changes on hourly time scales. Radio astronomers have observed this variability for the last ten years.  The goal of this project is to use available data to look at the properties of the black hole.  The investigator will study the flow of material near the black hole where its brightness changes. An important goal is measuring the direction the black hole rotates and comparing it with the rotation direction of the entire Milky Way. The analysis will measure the rotation axis by modeling the changes in the black hole over the past 10 years.  The investigator has initiated two public exhibits on radio astronomy at Northwestern's main library. This exhibit will focus on the impact of radio astronomy in our daily lives, the diversity of radio telescopes throughout the globe, and artistic aspects of detailed radio images.<br/><br/>The investigator focuses on three topics related to the variability of Sgr A*. One is to address the magnetic field orientation of optically thick variable emission from Sgr A*. How does this angle relate to the spin axis of the accretion flow and the large-scale jet-like feature. To address this issue, full-Stokes analyses of adiabatically-expanding synchrotron hotspot will be carried out. Second is to model simultaneous observations from NSF?s Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), to characterize the intrinsic variability of Sgr A* by applying the adiabatic expansion model. Using optical, infrared and radio light curves of Sgr A* the investigator will determine the submm/radio spectrum and emission variability across multiple flares. Third, archival VLA data taken with the VLA over the last ten years will be used to address the nature of variability on longer-than-hourly time scales. This study will determine the dynamics of the underlying variability statistics on timescales up to a decade, in order to determine  if the physical parameters of hotspots have changed with time, informing the history of the accretion flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field of computer vision explores the use of cameras and computers to automate tasks such as object recognition and activity recognition. Traditionally, researchers have developed computer vision systems by extracting the constituent features in an image or video and matching those features to models of more complex objects. More recently, machine learning methods have been applied that train a computer to perform such a recognition task from data rather than a physical model. This project explores a learning-based object recognition approach based on learning semantic relationships between objects and people observed in video. Specifically, the project attempts to design computing methods that will automatically derive relationships between people and objects in digital video and then exploit those correlative relationships in classifying a human action (e.g., kicking a ball or shaking hands). Unlike machine learning methods developed for understanding language, the proposed solution will use elements of the video specific to understanding human action such as detection of imaged objects, the motion of objects, and the spatial and temporal position in the video. Successful implementation of the computer vision solution will allow human activities in video to be automatically analyzed. The analysis will benefit critical tasks such as learning to perform a surgery or understanding the actions taken in an effective classroom.<br/><br/>Transformers are a type of neural network that use attention to compute relationships between words in a sentence or series of sentences. The advantages of the transformer model include the ability to assess these relationships over long sequences of words and the ability to automatically process all words simultaneously via a positional encoding. Instead of taking the transformer developed for natural language and fitting it to a video problem, this project seeks to develop a video transformer from first principles. The realization of this system involves three distinct advances in the machine learning design. First, the proposed approach brings the concept of motion as a feature to the transformer by way of optical flow information encoded with time. Second, the proposed method allows interactions between geometric and motion features of action semantics to exploited in a transformer framework. Last, the distribution-based attention model goes beyond the traditional correlative notion of attention. The proposed attention model captures significant correlations in action sequences. Together, the three theoretical contributions have the potential to significantly advance video understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In normal healing, body?s immune system helps to fight infection and remove damaged tissue. Inflammation should be temporary, and should wane as new healthy tissue is formed, but prolonged inflammation can delay or prevent healing. Prolonged inflammation can damage not only the surrounding tissue but also the implant material through a chemical process called oxidation. In severe cases of unresolved inflammation or infection implants must be removed or replaced. While much is known about how foreign materials lead to inflammation, very little is known about how they can promote the resolution of inflammation and subsequent tissue healing. These problems could be addressed by development of new materials that promote the resolution of inflammation. This work proposes a solution inspired by biology. Plants produce materials called ?condensed tannins? that protect plant tissues from bacterial and fungal pathogens and from the harmful effects of oxidation. This work will develop new materials for implants based on these condensed tannins. Condensed tannins will be modified so that they can guide inflammatory responses, and thereby promote healing, while also imparting antioxidant and antibacterial activity to implant surfaces. This work will also discover how these new materials modulate other outcomes related particularly to bone healing, such as stem cell growth and mineralization, so that the work can be translated to orthopedic implants. These new biomaterials based on condensed tannins will be developed from an abundant renewable resource, and they will provide new strategies for improving healing around implants. This work will yield new insights into the design of functional biomaterials that promote healing, reduce oxidation related damage, and fight infections. An international collaborator will contribute to a graduate course in global engineering and entrepreneurship. Outreach to the public will communicate how sustainable materials from abundant renewable resources can solve important challenges in medicine.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The ideal of a ?bioinert? biomaterial has not been realized. Materials in contact with biological environments adsorb proteins, which can induce inflammatory responses.

Condensed tannins are a class of plant-derived polyphenols, with excellent processing characteristics and valuable biological properties. Cellular responses to materials containing a commercially available, amphoteric aminated condensed tannin called tanfloc have been reported. This work hypothesizes that the chemistry of condensed tannins can be modified to modulate important biological responses to condensed tannin-based materials. This work aims to (i) chemically modify tanfloc to alter its acidity, basicity, and antioxidant activity; (ii) use the chemical modification to modulate protein binding, thereby modulating the polarization of macrophages, cellular inflammation, and antibacterial activity; and (iii) use the chemical modification to modulate mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and mineralization that are related to bone healing. Outcomes on surfaces containing the new condensed tannin derivatives will be compared to surfaces modified with polydopamine (a biopolymer with similar catecholamine chemistry to tanfloc), to oligoethylene glycol surfaces (presenting hydrogen bond acceptors but no acidic or basic groups), and to other materials commonly used in bone tissue engineering. This proposed work will produce three new condensed tannin derivatives, containing either increased (phenolic) acidity, increased (quaternary amine) basicity, or increased ether (o-methyl ether) functional groups, with well-characterized polyelectrolyte behavior, antioxidant activity, and degradation kinetics. This work will elucidate structure-property relationships that demonstrate how condensed tannin chemistry can be altered to modulate protein binding, macrophage polarization, phagocytosis, foreign body giant cell formation, and antibacterial activity. This work will also demonstrate that the chemistry of condensed tannins can modulate stem cell differentiation and mineralization on surfaces. The work will broaden participation of undergraduate and masters students in the research program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To fill in this gap, this project develops an online workshop that comprises of a set of interdisciplinary cutting-edge training sessions offered by six faculty members from five disciplines. With a focus on the latest innovations in GPU-based deep learning systems and applications, this workshop fosters a community of the next-generation cyberinfrastructure users and contributors, who can use, develop, and improve advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure for their deep learning research. Such training efforts enhance the knowledge of the deep learning and GPU cyberinfrastructure workforce, and subsequently contribute to the solutions of important scientific and societal problems, including hydrographic mapping in geography, space environment nowcasting in aerospace, and autonomous driving and traffic monitoring in transportation. The workshop will also attract trainees from underrepresented groups, including minority students and researchers from rural areas.<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary workshop developed in this project aims at enabling participants, including undergraduate seniors, graduate students, and researchers, to improve their multidisciplinary skillsets, extend their academic research portfolios, develop their remote collaboration capacities, and significantly strengthen their career competitiveness. To achieve this goal, the intensive workshop includes 1) a set of hands-on lecture modules that provide trainees with comprehensive knowledge and skills on the full stack of deep learning systems in advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure, 2) a series of talks on the cutting-edge research in advanced GPU cyberinfrastructure and deep learning systems and application given by renowned scientists invited from academic and industrial research institutes, and 3) a remote open-ended interdisciplinary collaborative project of applying techniques introduced in lectures into practice. In addition, a prototype of an interactive online training system is developed to provide computing resources for the trainees and to track their learning progress, for more effective and efficient training activities.

This project seeks to address these problems through developing ?digital twins? of image-guided surgery. The high level idea is to develop virtual reality simulations and computational models that closely mimic real patients, surgical tools, and operating environments. These simulations will help designers correct possible problems with robot and procedure designs early on; this in turn will allow faster, cheaper design cycles that will make robot-assisted surgery design more practical and widely available. The simulations can also be used to support real operations; room-scale models of the operating environment will support algorithms to monitor the robotic systems for safer surgeries, as well as provide new opportunities for educating both surgeons and the general public about ways technology is used to advance surgery.<br/><br/>The technical aims of this project are divided into two thrusts: In the first thrust, the team will develop innovative methods that enable the creation of virtual immersive and interactive simulation environments that precisely recreate scenarios of the real world. To build these so-called digital twins, the team will create computer vision and machine learning techniques to create, update, and leverage digital twins of the surgical environment from multi-modal measurements. The second thrust will use digital twin models of unstructured, human-in-the-loop environments to explore how these immersive simulation models may be used to accelerate the design of intelligent surgical systems and provide complementary situational awareness to enhance decision making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to address two fundamental aspects in this area.  The first regards the vibration-induced motion of a rigid body in a viscous liquid, when the vibration is produced by a time-periodically displaced mass inside the body. The wide area of applications of this phenomenon includes biomedical engineering and design of micro- and nano-technological equipment. The second aspect concerns the effect of flow-induced oscillations on a spring-mounted structure. These type of questions are of the utmost relevance in the study of the equilibrium and stability of suspension bridges and, in some cases, of their collapse, like in the notorious Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster. This award will also provide opportunities for the involvement of graduate students in the project's research.<br/><br/>Both projects fall into the realm of non-linear analysis and their study requires the use of fresh mathematical ideas that, possibly,  will be employed also in other areas of applied nonlinear PDE's. First and foremost is the investigation of (local and global) Hopf bifurcation in a liquid-solid interaction problem in presence of a continuum spectrum of the relevant linearized operator. To date, this question represents an entirely uncharted territory.  Another and not less important mathematical feature of the proposed research consists in the detailed study of the range of nonlinear elliptic operators (related to Navier-Stokes-like boundary-value problems) that are Fredholm of negative index.

This grant supports fundamental research that aims to create a new inkjet printing method to encapsulate ink in a liquid crystal substrate and eventually expands to a larger range of materials. If successful, the research outcomes will enable printing of advanced materials, including organic electronics for sensors and wearable devices, and benefit healthcare and energy sectors. The outreach and education activities involve students ranging from K-12 to undergraduate levels to stimulate interests in STEM fields, which will train the next generation of manufacturing workforce and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>Traditional inkjet printing requires ink materials with low viscosity and high ejection speed for the dispensing of ink droplets.

Instead of dispensing the ink droplet onto conventional solid surfaces, this grant supports basic research that aims to understand the impact-induced ink release mechanism for ink chemicals embedded in a liquid crystal film. In this process, the ink is released onto the liquid crystal surface using droplet impacts to enable the inkjet printing of viscous materials. Theoretical analysis will be carried out to identify critical conditions required for the controlled release of the embedded ink in the liquid crystal film. Critical parameters that allow the design of the liquid crystal film and the control of the ink release will be identified using experiments to understand the effects of Weber number on ink release.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Insects are the most abundant and diverse animal group, and like all living organisms, they evolved around viral infections. Understanding the impact viruses have on the lifecycles of insects is critical to maintaining healthy ecosystems throughout wildlands, agriculture, and urban environments. This project uses aphids, which are small insects that feed on plants, as a model organism. Aphids are found throughout ecosystems on many types of host plants and contain many different viruses. These viruses can impact the health and activity of both the insect and the host plants in ways that are still unknown. For this reason, this research aims to learn how inherited aphid viruses are passed on through generations while influencing the development of physical characteristics such as wings. This research also improves our ability to lessen the negative impacts of insects on agriculture while also promoting positive impacts on society. In addition, this project will engage students and agricultural communities on how interactions between viruses and insects contribute to healthy food webs and food security. This fellowship further addresses the impacts that virus-host interactions have on society by exploring the understudied role that viruses have in insect evolution.<br/> <br/>Specifically, this project uses single-stranded DNA viruses (Densovirinae) and viruses integrated into the aphid genomes (endogenous viral elements) as a tractable model system to study heritable virus-host interactions. RNA sequencing of field-collected aphids will be used to measure virus heritability, viral diversity, and the extent to which viral infection correlated with aphid wing production. CRISPR-targeted mutagenesis will be used to better understand the role of viruses integrated into host genomes. This research develops a comprehensive picture of the factors shaping heritable virus-host dynamics and the potential links to wing development while potentially uncovering previously unrecognized insect-specific viruses circulating in natural populations.

The spatiotemporal mechanisms of hot-spots and hot-moment carbon dynamics will be characterized using a combination of low and high-precision ground and airborne flux observations to determine the location and assess the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) hot-spots. Ground and remote sensing observations will determine the controls on the observed spatial distribution of hot-spots and fluxes, space-for-time analyses of plants, microbes, and landforms, coupled with the timing of permafrost degradation will infer the existence of hot-moments, while incubation experiments will illuminate the mechanisms driving hot-moments across sites across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska.

Preliminary work led by this team has confirmed such oscillation using in-situ observations in the California Current Region. This research involves the synergistic analysis of existing in-situ observations and modeling output to better understand the nature of the co-oscillation between winds and sea surface temperature at timescales of days in the global oceans. The exchange of heat, momentum, moisture, and gases across the air-sea transition zone plays critical roles in the Earth system predictability. Thus, an improved understanding of processes relevant to air-sea coupling has the potential to advance our understanding of many high-impact, societal-relevant phenomena, such as extreme weather events. This project will further our understanding of fundamental processes that control air-sea exchanges, essential to properly parametrizing them in numerical models and improving weather forecasting and climate projections. In particular, the research will deepen our understanding of interactions between two essential climate variables, i.e., wind and sea surface temperature. This study will investigate how the co-oscillation of these two variables impacts and responds to processes in the ocean mixed layer. The dynamics in this layer are fundamentally important for the Earth?s climate, as 95% of the anthropogenically created heat in the atmosphere is communicated to the ocean through the mixed layer. This project will support PI Bia Villas Bôas?a female, underrepresented minority, early career Assistant Professor?in her efforts to build her research program, and it will also support a Ph.D student who will be trained in physical oceanography at Colorado School of Mines. Villas Bôas is the only oceanographer at Mines, an institution that has historically focused on Earth resources, such as oil and gas. Establishing a strong presence in physical oceanography at Mines benefits the State of Colorado and the country because it will expose students that had little contact with environmental sciences to the role of the oceans in climate. Additionally, the PI and her group are committed to Open Science principles and are actively engaged in efforts to broaden participation and increase accessibility to oceanography and oceanographic data. The results from this project will be published in open access journals, and the data code will be made publicly available along with pedagogical Jupyter Notebooks examples for seamless reproducibility of the results.<br/><br/>This covariability between wind and SST manifests itself in correlations as an oscillation between negative and positive correlation with a cyclic nature with a 3-6 day period. What physical processes drive this oscillation and what sets its time scale remains unknown. In particular, the study will test the hypothesis that this co-oscillation results from a combined response to surface heat fluxes, wind-driven mixing, Ekman pumping, and other processes at the air-sea transition zone; thus, the characteristic duration and strength of these wind-SST feedbacks will vary based on season and geographic location.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon dioxide can be mineralized by spreading mineral and rock powders onto croplands, forests, and oceans, injecting carbon dioxide into basalt and sedimentary aquifers, and mine tailings. Scaling-up these options globally can potentially capture and store billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year. However, as a 2021 US long-term strategy report [1] stated, techniques of ?? enhanced mineralization, are still in nascent stages of research and development, so the potential magnitude of reductions and the timeframes over which these technologies might deliver reductions is unknown.? Currently, there are knowledge gaps in the basic science of carbon mineralization rates, the resolution of which is critical to discovering cost-effective carbon-dioxide-water-mineral interaction-based climate mitigation options. This research project meets this urgent societal need by both filling the knowledge gaps in geochemical reaction rates and mechanisms in multi-mineral systems and disseminating geochemical kinetics and modeling knowledge. <br/><br/>To acheive these science objectives, this project will carry out multiple isotope tracer (Si, K, Sr, Ca, Mg, Fe, K C isotopes) experiments for crushed basalts to determine the coupling of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions. Additionally, the researchers will perform innovative geochemical simulations to interpret the experimental results using an ensemble of models and evaluate model uncertainties. To meet the broader impact objective, researchers will leverage the national computational infrastructure and internet-based delivery technologies for training a diverse workforce for a carbon-neutral economy. A geochemical modeling web portal will be built to deliver modeling tools and databases as well as virtual short courses and online lessons for thermodynamics, geochemical modeling, and kinetics.

New proof-of-concept stalagmites from JX Cave, Mexico, cover a time period from approximately 53,000 to 105,000 years before present (BP), and a new sample from Sistema Huatla, Mexico spans 115,000 to 340,000 years BP. <br/><br/>The preliminary data from these samples departs from a smooth sinusoidal orbital insolation hypothesis, and instead shows abrupt threshold-like behavior including monsoon collapses apparently coincident with Heinrich events in the North Atlantic, notably during the relatively warm interval of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5b.  The research will focus on weak monsoon intervals during non-glacial warm periods such as MIS 5, 7, and 9, because these times may represent paleo-analogs of future aridity associated with the projected weakening of ocean circulation due to anthropogenic climate change.<br/><br/>Why this research and why now? The prevailing orbital monsoon hypothesis describes a strong and positively coupled relationship between summer incoming solar radiation (insolation) on orbital precession (21,000 year) timescales and regional monsoon strength. Long monsoon paleoclimate records are revealed in the inverse correlation between regional scale monsoon strength and speleothem oxygen isotope values. The orbital control on monsoons is strongly expressed in the East Asian and South American monsoon systems where speleothem oxygen isotope time series show smooth sinusoidal variations that are paced by orbital insolation.  However, in other tropical areas the orbital insolation hypothesis fails to explain hydroclimate variations, notably in Central America, where speleothem oxygen isotope does not correlate to summer insolation.  This disconnect suggests that paleoclimate variations in southern Mexico and Central America (Mesoamerica) may be explained by the orbital monsoon hypothesis.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include supporting a graduate student training and engaging students from historical underrepresented groups students in Nevada and also at Fort Valley State University, an Historical Black College and University (HBCU) in Georgia.

Due to the speed in which Arctic landscapes are changing, and the massive carbon pools locked in permafrost, improving knowledge of the key interactions between plants and micro-organisms and their impacts on greenhouse gas release is essential for predicting how thawing Arctic soils will contribute to global climate change.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this project is to determine the micro-scale mechanisms driving hot-spot and hot-moment carbon dynamics, for improving predictions of macro-scale carbon balance. We hypothesize that the altered spatiotemporal distribution of degrading nutrient-rich permafrost has and will fundamentally alter the structure and function of northern tundra ecosystems, from microbes to landscapes. This multi-scale interdisciplinary project will transform our knowledge of fundamental plant-soil-microbial interactions that govern past and projected carbon cycle dynamics in permafrost ecosystems, while advancing knowledge of the key biogeochemical consequences of permafrost thaw over space (i.e., plot to landscape) and time (i.e., seasonal to decadal). The spatiotemporal mechanisms of hot-spots and hot-moment carbon dynamics will be characterized using a combination of low and high-precision ground and airborne flux observations to determine the location and assess the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) hot-spots. Ground and remote sensing observations will determine the controls on the observed spatial distribution of hot-spots and fluxes, space-for-time analyses of plants, microbes, and landforms, coupled with the timing of permafrost degradation will infer the existence of hot-moments, while incubation experiments will illuminate the mechanisms driving hot-moments across sites across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska. The proposed research will therefore provide the foundation for next-generation mechanistic and process-based models to represent novel disturbance regimes in the new Arctic.

However, it is also a challenging subject for many students to learn. A key determinant of students' success in modern CS classrooms is whether and how they use self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, such as planning, goal setting, and adapting their learning strategies to meet new challenges. The aim of this project is to help develop theory to explain how students engage in self-regulation, specifically in CS classrooms, and how this impacts their learning outcomes. This CS-specific model of SRL is critical to help scientists develop effective interventions for improving student learning (e.g., teaching students how to set effective goals) because it will help computer science educators and researchers predict how students might respond to those interventions. To advance theory, this project will develop new methods for studying SRL in CS classrooms. Currently, one of the best ways to study SRL in detail is to have students think out loud as they work and learn, so scientists can understand what SRL skills and strategies students are using and why they are using them. However, this is a time-consuming process, and it is impractical to use in real classrooms. To address this challenge, this project will pair think-aloud data with the log data students produce when learning with technology, to verify how to use this log data as a measure of students? SRL. Being able to rely on these automatically logged data will allow scientists to study SRL in authentic CS classrooms, at scale, with large, diverse groups of learners. These studies may also help determine how SRL processes in CS courses are similar or distinct from those in other STEM courses. The results of this project will help CS education researchers to develop more effective learning interventions, especially for students who are underrepresented in CS.<br/><br/>This project will apply, test, and elaborate a model of self-regulated learning (SRL) in computer science (CS) education (i.e., SRCSL) by validating and analyzing fine-grained trace data from students' interactions with programming tools in authentic undergraduate classroom settings. SRL encompasses students' thoughtful pursuit of academic goals by planning, monitoring, controlling, and reflecting upon what and how they learn. These behaviors are a key determinant of students' success in many domains, including CS. Discipline-based models of SRL in CS are still nascent and largely untested in rigorous ways that reflect cutting-edge practices for data collection and validation that can scale to larger populations. The development of a SRCSL model requires large-scale collection of validated SRL traces from authentic CS classrooms. To do so, first the project will use laboratory studies to collect both digital trace data from programming tools and think-aloud protocol (TAP) data from students as they complete authentic learning activities, coding TAPs to identify SRL events. Researchers will align these two data sources, mapping digitally logged events to the verbal SRL events that they reflect, and then use the coded TAP data to validate inferences about what SRL processes the digital trace data indicate. Second, researchers will collect a large sample (N ? 2,000) of trace data from two CS courses and apply the validated mapping to identify SRL events, from digital trace data, as they occur in the classroom. This will afford analyses regarding the sequential, contingent, and dynamic nature of SRL, informing an empirically-supported initial model of SRCSL. The proposed model will also posit how SRL behaviors predict students' cognitive and non-cognitive course outcomes, how these relationships vary across course contexts, and how they are moderated by students' personal characteristics. This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Joel F. Swift is ""Genomic and metagenomic mechanisms of flood tolerance in maize and Tripsacum dactyloides"" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Kansas and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Maggie R. Wagner.<br/><br/>As the global climate changes, flood events are becoming more frequent and severe. While water is a basic requirement for plants, too much can have dramatic consequences. When flooded, fundamental root functions like gas diffusion decline dramatically. This leads to oxygen starvation, the buildup of ethylene (a key stress hormone), and eventually plant death. Many plant species cope by producing root aerenchyma, a spongy tissue that assists in gas diffusion. Some species continuously form aerenchyma, while other species only form aerenchyma under stress. Ethylene acts as the stimulus for both modes, but the mechanisms of formation differ. Root-associated microorganisms can break down ethylene precursors, which modifies ethylene levels, and potentially contributes to plant flood stress adaptation. This research will explore the links between plant genetics, root physiology, and the microbiome to understand their effects on plant flood responses. This will provide key information to assist in breeding flood-resilient crops. The researcher will develop expertise in quantitative genetics, plant physiology, and anatomical analysis. As a community college graduate, Joel will engage and mentor students from the host institution and local community colleges; seeking to further promote diversity in STEM and instill an interest in plant science careers, from the basic to applied biological perspectives. <br/><br/>Zea mays (corn or maize) is a globally important crop that is cultivated widely across temperate North America. Corn?s closest temperate relative is Tripsacum dactyloides (gamagrass). Corn (stress-induced) and gamagrass (constitutive) represent the spectrum of aerenchyma production strategies. This project will utilize these species as a comparative system for examining the effects of intra- and inter-specific root trait variation on the microbiome under flood stress. Several corn genotypes will be used to establish a temporal baseline for flood responses. Corn gene expression, elemental composition, and root microbiome composition will be measured before, during, and after recovery from waterlogging and submergence. Root phenotypic variation will be quantified across a gamagrass diversity panel. Root gene expression of accessions with contrasting performance under waterlogging will be compared, with a focus on the differential transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. Conditioned soils from waterlogging experiments will be collected and reinoculated onto new seedlings to test whether root-driven changes in the soil microbiota affect corn and gamagrass phenotypes and fitness in a contemporary flood. Results will be disseminated via conference presentations, publication in open-access journals, and by depositing sequence data and code into public repositories including the NCBI Short Read Archive, GitHub, and Zenodo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although there have been extensive studies on the modeling of fiber coating dynamics, the inherent nonlinearity and degeneracy of these models often present analytical and computational challenges in broader applications. This research project aims to develop a hybrid numerical and machine learning framework that accelerates the computation and facilitates the control of large-scale stiff problems associated with fiber coating systems.

The objectives of the project are organized around three interconnected aspects: 1) Analysis of the regularity and structure of traveling droplets described by coupled PDE systems. The derived structures will be utilized to develop simplified dynamical systems from full-order models for individual droplets. A prototype control problem will be studied to establish the foundation for control design of general fiber coating systems; 2) Development of robust and structural-preserving algorithms for simulating and learning fiber coating dynamics.

The research is organized around two overarching objectives: developing single molecule-based electrokinetic and spectro-electrochemical probes of transport in one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures; and applying these tools to explore the interaction between electrically-modulated wetting phenomena and nanoconfined flows. The first objective will be addressed by fabricating structures to access transport in the ultralow Peclét number regime; developing correlative and frequency-domain measurements to characterize fluid transport and fluid-wall interactions; and implementing these measurement strategies to study electrokinetic flows in confined 1D nanocylinder and nanochannel flow formats. The second objective will be pursued by developing nanoconfined architectures that support electrowetting phenomena; and applying electrowetting principles to control nanoconfined flow in both model systems and in hierarchically-organized, multi-lamellar structures with depth-varying porosity.

Studies will be implemented in a well-defined water-organic solvent interface that can support quantitative electrochemical and spectroscopic experiments capable of reporting on the state of the aqueous-organic interfaces as a function of applied potential. These studies are directed at establishing the design rules, structural motifs, and operating principles needed to achieve a high level of control over molecular transport in nano-confined volumes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, cloud services have access to the digital data of millions of users and become a lucrative target for criminals and cyberattacks. Sensitive data are stolen from cloud servers, incurring significant financial losses to those impacted. To address the shortcomings of current protection technologies in cloud computing, this project employs advanced cryptography and introduces new privacy protections that allow data to remain secure even when the cloud service is compromised. The project's novelties are in the judicious design of computers that can understand and process encrypted information such that, even if data are stolen or under attack, they will be incomprehensible to the attacker. The project's broader significance and importance is in addressing the urgent need of the cloud computing industry to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks and to protect the privacy of users, which is aligned with the mission of the National Science Foundation.<br/> <br/>The key observation in this project is that data are immune to leakage threats as long as they remain encrypted at all times, including during processing. Towards that end, the investigator employs a special form of encryption, called Fully Homomorphic Encryption, to protect general-purpose computation using diverse hardware platforms such as graphics processing units. Specifically, this project defines imperative models of computation that improve the programmability of encrypted data processing, without sacrificing execution performance. These models are complemented with real-life applications such as privacy-preserving machine learning and data mining that harness the power of encrypted computation. The results of this project are integrated with educational activities, including web-based learning environments and cybersecurity competitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large fraction is for single-use applications. Consequently, more than 25 million metric tons of plastic are annually discarded into terrestrial environments. Bio-based plastics produced from readily renewable carbon sources (i.e., corn) are increasingly being used as substitutes for legacy plastics sourced from fossil fuels. Bio-based plastics are advantageous because their carbon is converted from atmospheric CO2 instead of petroleum. Furthermore, some of these plastics are designed to biodegrade in bioactive environments. All plastics are broken down in the environment by chemical and physical processes into smaller microplastics (less than 5 mm in size) that may become accessible to microorganisms and utilized for their life function or survival. The fate of microplastic residues depends on their degradation in the environment. This research tracks the degradation of microplastic particles of polylactic acid (PLA, a bio-based plastic) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, a petroleum-based plastic) in soils, where their slow decomposition can lead to plastic accumulation. The research exploits unique carbon isotopic ?tags? naturally inherent or artificially introduced to plastics to quantify decomposition with imaging and microbial community analysis to identify how degradation is occurring. The main goal of the work is to monitor the transferal of the isotopic tags to microbial biomass, and eventually, the carbon dioxide and/or methane gas microbes produce or ?exhale?. The research is important because it will expand society?s limited understanding of how plastics impact soil health and function, and natural earth processes (i.e., carbon cycling) given plastics? potential to alter the natural emission of climate warming gases like carbon dioxide and methane in soil systems. Bringing the science of microplastics to a diverse community is a priority of the research team. The project involves and supports secondary, undergraduate, and graduate level students that will be co-mentored by a multidisciplinary faculty team. Students will be involved in research objectives and trained in communicating science to the public. Importantly, students will gain experience across three increasingly related fields for solving the plastic pollution crisis: geochemistry, analytical chemistry, and polymer/green chemistry.<br/><br/>Microplastic decomposition occurs through synergistic abiotic weathering of the plastic and key enzymatic and/or microbial interactions. Due to their acclimation to anthropogenic waste, it is hypothesized that the soil microbiome will assimilate and mineralize microplastics, and that natural soil processes like physical mixing and chemical hydrolysis will promote the integration of soil plastics within aggregates and affect the overall assimilation and mineralization of soil organic carbon and plastics by the soil microbiome. The hypotheses will be tested in controlled soil microcosms by utilizing naturally abundant and isotopically labeled (synthesized) polymers that are experimentally degraded and exposed to soils and their native microbiome. Isotopic labels offer an approach to identify assimilation and/or mineralization since they will separate these and other competing processes and/or those that may be impractical to measure in a short period. The incorporation of the plastics? isotope label will be monitored via phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers and final mineralization gases (i.e., carbon dioxide and methane) using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Spectroscopy based approaches (i.e., synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy) will account for the plastics? reactivity and association with soil aggregates. The combination of stable isotopic, spectral, and isotopic mass balance approaches will establish a fundamental understanding of plastic decomposition, and include a modeling of their assimilation and mineralization, transformation to lower weight products, and final conversion to carbon dioxide and methane in soils. This research will further basic science understanding of physical, chemical, and biological processes in soils and address a topic of great current practical interest in environmental geochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While genome sequencing, assembly and gene annotation are less of a bottleneck for researchers today, predicting and validating gene functions is still a major challenge. This is especially the case for genes in large families, such as those encoding metabolic enzymes. Such enzymes are associated with critical primary and specialized metabolic pathways, and the current lack of their meaningful annotation is a major barrier to pathway discovery. Chemistry is the language of the plant world: metabolites mediate defenses against pests, pathogens and abiotic stresses, attract mutualists and play a role in defining growth patterns and crop yield. Societally, plant metabolites are important for foods, drugs, cosmetics and numerous other products. Improving metabolic gene annotation is therefore crucial not just for understanding fundamental plant biology, but also for societal impacts by aiding crop breeding/engineering and synthetic biology. This project, focusing on ten of the largest plant enzyme families, will (1) facilitate deposition of hundreds of published enzyme activities into public repositories such as the UniProt and Gene Ontology databases; (2) develop computational pipelines for predicting enzyme function from high-quality sequenced genomes; (3) develop and apply synthetic biology-based tools for rapid validation of predicted enzyme function; and (4) derive novel evolutionary and functional insights from the accumulated datasets. Research efforts will be coupled with activities that improve inclusive undergraduate participation in research and an art exhibition to demonstrate the power of synthetic biology in creating dynamic, living art pieces. <br/><br/>In most plant genomes, genes involved in metabolism belong to large gene families with dozens of members and are poorly annotated. This creates a barrier for dissecting the genetic basis of metabolic traits such as yield, fruit ripening, stress response, and mutualistic interactions. Three critical bottlenecks stymie these efforts: (1) although thousands of enzyme activities have been published, only a miniscule fraction of these are logged into protein function databases and available for use by powerful function prediction programs and machine learning approaches; (2) existing vocabularies and tools for function transfer are not based on substrate chemistry and do not take into account enzyme promiscuity; and, (3) synthetic biology (SynBio) tools for rapid functional validation of computational predictions are insufficiently developed. To address these challenges, this project will (1) develop a Cas9-based SynBio tool using RNA vectors and synthetic transcription factors, enabling high-throughput gene function validation in three angiosperm species; (2) facilitate one of the largest depositions of published plant enzyme activities of 10 targeted enzyme families into the UniProt and GO databases, as well as develop a computational workflow to predict substrate classes of the targeted enzyme family members from 150 high-quality plant genomes; and, (3) apply these workflows to investigate in vivo roles and evolution of these enzyme families. With respect to training and outreach, the project will engage undergraduate students in pathway discovery studies where students will sample biochemical diversity in flora and probe underlying metabolic pathways of non-reference/medicinal plants. In addition, the project will work with faculty in the Colorado State University?s Department of Art and Art History to develop novel SynBio-generated dynamic living art pieces where plants will be used as ?canvases? painted with natural colors/pigments synthesized in planta using RNA vectors. All project outcomes that include new computational tools, biological resources and datasets will be shared broadly through public access repositories and through training workshops at national plant science conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding these gas-surface reactions is challenging, since the likelihood of reaction depends on the speed and angle that molecules strike the surface, and these are difficult to control. Further complicating matters, when surfaces are viewed up close, they exhibit many atomic-scale structures, including steps, missing atoms, and islands, each of which can exhibit different reactivity. Professor Sibener and his students will use molecular beams to control the collision with the surface and then visualize how molecules attach to, react, and depart from the interface. Their discoveries could reveal the underlying mechanisms that govern chemical reactivity in a host of emerging technologies, including the design  and development of new functional materials for sustainable chemistry and quantum information science applications.

Reactants will be pre-aligned using either oriented surface adsorption or pre-ordered reactive end-groups on self-assembled monolayers, thus presenting sterically controlled reaction partners to incident gas phase reagents. This will allow systematic exploration of molecular reactivity and reaction pathways using defined entrance channel reaction conditions including well-defined energy and polar/azimuthal angles of attack with respect to the molecular framework. Comparisons with dissociative chemisorption and reactive scattering calculations, done in conjunction with quantum theory and molecular dynamics simulations, will lead to precision tests of calculated reaction potential energy surfaces and mechanistic reaction pathways. Control of reagent energy, incident angle, intensity, and quantum state will enable the examination of interfacial chemistry under non-equilibrium energetic conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their popularity is due to their excellent performance in practice and their computational efficiency. But knowledge of the reasons behind their outstanding performance remains quite limited.

Optimal control problems are often encountered in engineering and in physical, economic, and social sciences. Examples of optimal control problems include how to control the firing of rocket thrusters to reach a selected target with minimum fuel expenditure, or how to implement monetary policy to minimize unemployment. The underlying mathematical difficulties of the theory are compounded when the time interval for the problem under consideration becomes infinite, and uncertainties, i.e., stochastic effects, need to be accounted for. This project will study stochastic optimal control problems with infinite horizon and extend the knowledge in the field through the introduction of significant extensions of current models to incorporate new effects, and also new models, both of which necessitate new ideas and approaches for their analysis. The project will also provide opportunities for the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in this research. <br/><br/>This project will investigate several important aspects of stochastic optimal control problems with infinite horizon, including: (i) Optimal control of linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) having mean-field and involving average quadratic costs, via invariant measures; (ii) Turnpike properties of stochastic optimal controls for SDEs; (iii) maximum principle of stochastic optimal controls in infinite horizon for SDEs and for stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs); (iv) Time-inconsistent optimal controls over infinite time horizon for SDEs.

This project addresses key questions in the region, including the location of the active plate margin, the composition of the rocks, the role do fluids sourced from great depth and high crustal temperatures in shaping earthquake and volcanic hazards in the area. The researchers will employ a geophysical tool, both on-land and within the Salton Sea, that is capable of recording tiny fluctuations in the Earth?s natural electromagnetic field and extract from these data estimates of subsurface electrical conductivities, i.e., how well the rocks and materials conduct electric currents. This information will then be translated to rock composition to depths greater than 100 km, fluid pathways and concentrations from these depths to mapped surface faults and volcanic targets, temperature variations, and fault dimensions and geometries, all with the aim of better defining the Salton Trough?s unique tectonic architecture. In addition to informing local seismic and volcanic hazards, broader impacts will include the education of two graduate students, a postdoctoral scholar, and local high schoolers during field campaigns as well as building connections between tectonic activity and the potential and prevalence of critical minerals (e.g., lithium) being explored in this area at present.<br/><br/>The Salton Trough is an exemplary case of the confluence of all three plate tectonic margin types, combining the southern San Andreas fault system (SSAF, transform) interrupted by localized incipient rifting (divergent) and abutted to the west by the Peninsular Ranges, a remnant of Farallon slab subduction (convergent). All these systems contribute to a region of complex structure and strain, rich in aqueous fluids and melts, and play key roles in the potential for destructive earthquakes along the critically strained SSAF and volcanic activity in the area. The research team will image and inform this tectonically complex region by deploying multi-scale (sites 100s m to 10s km apart) and amphibious (including the Salton Sea) magnetotelluric arrays and extracting electrical conductivity information from the surface into the uppermost asthenosphere. At the largest scale (>10 km) this information will address questions on variations in lithospheric-scale fabric, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and dehydration of the subducted Farallon slab. The focus of the mid-scale deployments will be crustal and uppermost mantle composition, the partitioning of fluids, partial melt, and by inference strain, and the evolution of these properties from transform to incipient rifting areas. At the finest scales (stations <1 km apart), the imaged conductivities will help highlight fault zone porosity, fluid content and attitudes and how these differ between creeping (e.g., SSAF) and locked fault strands. These multi-scale estimates, combined with existing geoscientific knowledge, will provide a more holistic understanding of local tectonics and its related geohazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address these challenges, this project will (1) develop a Cas9-based SynBio tool using RNA vectors and synthetic transcription factors, enabling high-throughput gene function validation in three angiosperm species; (2) facilitate one of the largest depositions of published plant enzyme activities of 10 targeted enzyme families into the UniProt and GO databases, as well as develop a computational workflow to predict substrate classes of the targeted enzyme family members from 150 high-quality plant genomes; and, (3) apply these workflows to investigate in vivo roles and evolution of these enzyme families. With respect to training and outreach, the project will engage undergraduate students in pathway discovery studies where students will sample biochemical diversity in flora and probe underlying metabolic pathways of non-reference/medicinal plants. In addition, the project will work with faculty in the Colorado State University?s Department of Art and Art History to develop novel SynBio-generated dynamic living art pieces where plants will be used as ?canvases? painted with natural colors/pigments synthesized in planta using RNA vectors. All project outcomes that include new computational tools, biological resources and datasets will be shared broadly through public access repositories and through training workshops at national plant science conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses key questions in the region, including the location of the active plate margin, the composition of the rocks, the role do fluids sourced from great depth and high crustal temperatures in shaping earthquake and volcanic hazards in the area. The researchers will employ a geophysical tool, both on-land and within the Salton Sea, that is capable of recording tiny fluctuations in the Earth?s natural electromagnetic field and extract from these data estimates of subsurface electrical conductivities, i.e., how well the rocks and materials conduct electric currents. This information will then be translated to rock composition to depths greater than 100 km, fluid pathways and concentrations from these depths to mapped surface faults and volcanic targets, temperature variations, and fault dimensions and geometries, all with the aim of better defining the Salton Trough?s unique tectonic architecture. In addition to informing local seismic and volcanic hazards, broader impacts will include the education of two graduate students, a postdoctoral scholar, and local high schoolers during field campaigns as well as building connections between tectonic activity and the potential and prevalence of critical minerals (e.g., lithium) being explored in this area at present.<br/><br/>The Salton Trough is an exemplary case of the confluence of all three plate tectonic margin types, combining the southern San Andreas fault system (SSAF, transform) interrupted by localized incipient rifting (divergent) and abutted to the west by the Peninsular Ranges, a remnant of Farallon slab subduction (convergent). All these systems contribute to a region of complex structure and strain, rich in aqueous fluids and melts, and play key roles in the potential for destructive earthquakes along the critically strained SSAF and volcanic activity in the area. The research team will image and inform this tectonically complex region by deploying multi-scale (sites 100s m to 10s km apart) and amphibious (including the Salton Sea) magnetotelluric arrays and extracting electrical conductivity information from the surface into the uppermost asthenosphere. At the largest scale (>10 km) this information will address questions on variations in lithospheric-scale fabric, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and dehydration of the subducted Farallon slab. The focus of the mid-scale deployments will be crustal and uppermost mantle composition, the partitioning of fluids, partial melt, and by inference strain, and the evolution of these properties from transform to incipient rifting areas. At the finest scales (stations <1 km apart), the imaged conductivities will help highlight fault zone porosity, fluid content and attitudes and how these differ between creeping (e.g., SSAF) and locked fault strands. These multi-scale estimates, combined with existing geoscientific knowledge, will provide a more holistic understanding of local tectonics and its related geohazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This oxidation state of a magma is important because it plays a large role in regulating the style of the eruption and how explosive it is. The project will apply a new analytical technique to volcanic products from Mounts Shasta and St. Helens to gain a more thorough understanding of how their magmas have changed as they ascend to the surface before eruption. This work could lead to better indices of hazard assessment in active volcanic systems. This project supports a postdoctoral researcher who will build their expertise in spectroscopic measurements and gain experience in project leadership. It will also provide undergraduates valuable experience with laboratory research in the geosciences. Both PIs have dedicated much of their careers to encouraging and working with students from underrepresented groups in the STEM fields to grow diversity of scientific thoughts and backgrounds and opportunities for all.<br/><br/>The project will enable in situ measurements of feldspar chemistry and fO2, using a large diverse calibration suite of >180 samples.

It will result in new geochemical calibrations available to the geologic community and new insights into the role played by feldspar in partitioning cations with coexisting melts. Specifically, this project includes tasks that will enable Fe valence state and fO2 to be evaluated directly from feldspar single crystals using XAS, and will be complemented by other types of spectroscopic measurements: 1) Grow liquidus feldspars over a range of bulk compositions, fO2, and temperature to be used as standards for an XAS fO2 calibration; 2) Create a feldspar calibration for microanalysis of Fe3+ in feldspar using polarized, high-resolution XAS measurements of independently constrained standards using the pre-edge and main-edge regions of oriented single crystals; 3) Use the equilibrated feldspars with known fO2 to create a feldspar calibration for fO2 using polarized, high-resolution XAS; 4) Test and apply our feldspar calibration for fO2 on Bushveld, Shasta, and Mount St. Helens samples; 5) With undergraduate researchers leading the work, characterize the same suite of samples assembled for the oxybarometers using Raman, Mössbauer, ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and reflectance FTIR spectroscopies, looking for linkages between composition and spectral response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, the formation of solid-like gels at water-oil interfaces during oil recovery processes can be unfavorable because gel build-up can clog wells and pipelines. On the other hand, gel formation can actually be beneficial in flow diversion processes by diverting the flow away from porous rocks and enhancing oil recovery. The interface dynamics and morphologies of this open system cannot be predicted solely by an equilibrium phase diagram, and mathematical models and numerical simulations are needed to fully characterize the nonlinear, out-of-equilibrium dynamics.  This project aims to establish a computational framework for models of non-equilibrium phenomena, and design algorithms and experiments to investigate the interface dynamics of complex, reactive fluids. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training for students, and research activities will help develop the next generation of mathematicians, scientists and engineers. The team of PIs consists of the three researchers from three different institutions, where training of graduate students on the topics of the project is expected. <br/><br/>Studies of two or more fluids that are reactive, and flow through a porous medium, are fundamental to many fields. At equilibrium, the mixture may behave like a liquid or a gel (viscoelastic solid) depending on the concentrations of the components according to an equilibrium phase diagram. When driven out of equilibrium by, for instance, injection of one fluid into another, the morphology of the expanding interface between them can be very complex and strongly depends on an interplay between thermodynamic phase behavior and hydrodynamic forces. This project builds upon breakthroughs in modeling, computation, and experimental techniques to develop a unified mathematical framework that resolves the interface dynamics of reactive fluids driven out of equilibrium. Thermodynamically consistent equations governing the non-equilibrium dynamics of ternary reacting systems of immiscible fluids will be derived, focusing on the radial Hele-Shaw geometry as a prototype. Both sharp interface and diffuse interface numerical schemes (energy-stable, adaptive finite-difference methods using scalar auxiliary variables) will be developed and validated against asymptotic reductions to sharp interface models and new experimental data generated from this project. The integrated mathematical, computational and experimental approach will provide a framework for understanding the nonequilibrium dynamics, predicting the emergence of complex patterns and developing strategies for controlling the pattern formation process in fundamental multiphysics interface problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address these challenges, this project focuses on the potential of place-based learning, field science, and digital storytelling to nurture diverse middle school youths? environmental agency, STEM career knowledge, and STEM identities. The project includes a series of summer camps and school-year Saturday Academies to investigate the history, ecology, and restoration of a local watershed where youths? schools are located. The watershed has unique biodiversity and is increasingly impacted by negative climate events in a city experiencing rapid population growth. Youth will work alongside STEM professionals, college student mentors, and community leaders to engage in environmental science fieldwork and restoration of the watershed. Youth will create stories about the land, water, people, and history of the watershed using podcasts, augmented reality (AR), and digital zines, with mentorship from professional experts in each of these media. Digital storytelling is a way for youth to recapture a sense of agency amidst considerable climate anxiety as the stories? digital and mobile nature have the potential to reach diverse audiences and encourage scientific, affective, sociocultural, and historical knowledge of the watershed. The project team includes an array of community stakeholders who live near, study, restore, and advocate for the watershed. This project aims to develop and involve the next generation of STEM-knowledgeable community stakeholders. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. <br/><br/>In this project, youth are positioned as creators rather than consumers of media. The project will result in design principles for the pairing of digital technologies and place-based learning for settings that nurture youths? STEM knowledge, agency, identities, and well-being. A primary contribution to the advancement of knowledge will be a grounded theory of identity play, which includes: 1) key indicators of identity play; 2) relationships among place-based learning, digital storytelling, and identity play; and 3) unique affordances of digital storytelling in encouraging identity play. These contributions will be achieved through constant comparative analysis of multiple sources of data including pre/post nature walk recordings, post interviews, observations of key activities. 60 middle school youth will be direct participants of this study. Identity play is a construct that highlights the agency within identity development and provides a new way of conceptualizing growth. Rather than viewing growth solely as becoming more scientific or movement towards STEM, identity play is expansive so that growth may be non-linear and networked. Identity play may involve things like trying out, finding a better alternative, stretching, and combining previously disconnected interests. The practical implications of a grounded theory of identity play include designing for multiple STEM entry points and pathways, recognizing that youths? decisions not to pursue certain pathways may be productive, and explaining the impacts of out-of-school STEM experiences on diverse youths? career choices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To broaden participation and help build the next generation of highly qualified and diverse nanochemistry scientists, the Vela group will offer internships to first generation or under-represented undergraduates, contribute to the career development of postdoctoral fellows, and prepare first year graduate students to apply for research fellowships.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Javier Vela and his team will utilize their expertise in the synthesis and spectroscopic study of optically active nanomaterials to: (1) study the evolution of perovskite chalcogenide nanocrystals for photovoltaics, (2) develop tin-based quaternary chalcohalide nanocrystals for optoelectronics, and (3) test ternary tetrahedral nanocrystals for carbon dioxide reduction. Compared to the high temperature synthesis of single crystal or bulk semiconductors, the synthesis of nanoscale multinary semiconductors from solution can be particularly challenging.  Unlike unary or binary nanocrystals, the nucleation and growth of multinary nanocrystals from multiple precursors in a single, simultaneous step can be entropically demanding.  In fact, metallic or binary seeds often precede the formation, through interfacial chemistry, of the final multinary nanophase. Further, multinary semiconductors often adopt more than one polymorph, each of which may contain mixed-occupancy sites or ?coloring? patterns.  This project will focus on multinary semiconductors that, in addition to being defect-tolerant, show increased stability to conditions of heat and high humidity or under continuous illumination. Colloidal synthesis from readily available precursors is expected to serve as a sustainable route  into a wide range of functional multinary nanocrystals.

At its heart, algebraic geometry studies the geometry of the solution of polynomial equations. These are the simplest possible equations and so, not surprisingly, they play an important role in almost any scientific discipline. In particular algebraic geometry has close ties with differential and analytic geometry, commutative algebra, topology, number theory, physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, and many areas of applied mathematics. The most fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is to classify all geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. The minimal model program is the most successful approach to this classification program and has recently had extraordinary success in classifying complex varieties, i.e. solution sets consisting of complex numbers. It is hoped that these techniques will extend to other contexts such as varieties defined over fields of positive characteristics and to complex analytic varieties. The PI will involve graduate students and post-docs in various aspects of this project.<br/><br/>This project will generalize the results of the minimal model program over the complex numbers to the case of varieties over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic (and to the case of mixed characteristics) as well as the case of Kahler varieties. In particular, the PI will show that the minimal model program holds for compact Kahler klt threefolds and fourfolds and will develop the theory of generalized klt Kahler varieties. The PI will investigate the minimal model program for threefolds in characteristic 3 and the pluricanonical maps of projective 3-folds over algebraically closed fields of large characteristics. The minimal model program in mixed characteristic will also be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core of the infrastructure is a highly scalable syntactic differencing algorithm that models a programmer?s viewpoint of software change.  The infrastructure also supports querying and exploration of changes and is used to determine which programming language syntactic structures change between two source code versions.  Current differencing approaches have no understanding of the syntax of the programming language being used.  Thus, srcDiff produces a more accurate and human-understandable difference of changes.  The approach is very scalable and can be applied to large software systems.<br/><br/>Accurately analyzing changes to software is vital for studying how large critical software systems evolve.  srcDiff provides a means to produce accurate differences in an efficient and scalable manner.  The proposed infrastructure will greatly reduce the burden researchers and practitioners incur in obtaining, analyzing, and processing software changes.  Changes to software are used directly or indirectly for a wide variety of tasks including software merging, clone detection, author attribution, bug localization, feature location, recommender systems, commit classification, and much more.  Several tools for differencing exist, but there is no other syntactic differencing approach for source code that is accurate, scalable, lossless, and supports analysis of the results.  Currently, no usable syntactic differencing infrastructure is widely available to researchers or practitioners.<br/><br/>Change is an integral part of software development.  Knowledge about changes is required for the day-to-day activities of software developers.  srcDiff will reduce the cost to perform various types of research and enable a platform for the development of various types of tools to directly aid software developers.  As part of their daily development tasks, developers need to inspect recent and past changes, perform code reviews, merge branches, and debug software.  Software project managers need to make informed decisions that require knowledge of changes to their systems, such as change impact analysis.  The proposed infrastructure has the potential to positively impact and improve the quality of all types of software.  The srcDiff infrastructure appeals to a variety of stakeholders, including researchers, students, and software practitioners.<br/><br/>The srcDiff project website is at www.srcDiff.org.

We hypothesize that the altered spatiotemporal distribution of degrading nutrient-rich permafrost has and will fundamentally alter the structure and function of northern tundra ecosystems, from microbes to landscapes. This multi-scale interdisciplinary project will transform our knowledge of fundamental plant-soil-microbial interactions that govern past and projected carbon cycle dynamics in permafrost ecosystems, while advancing knowledge of the key biogeochemical consequences of permafrost thaw over space (i.e., plot to landscape) and time (i.e., seasonal to decadal). The spatiotemporal mechanisms of hot-spots and hot-moment carbon dynamics will be characterized using a combination of low and high-precision ground and airborne flux observations to determine the location and assess the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) hot-spots. Ground and remote sensing observations will determine the controls on the observed spatial distribution of hot-spots and fluxes, space-for-time analyses of plants, microbes, and landforms, coupled with the timing of permafrost degradation will infer the existence of hot-moments, while incubation experiments will illuminate the mechanisms driving hot-moments across sites across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska. The proposed research will therefore provide the foundation for next-generation mechanistic and process-based models to represent novel disturbance regimes in the new Arctic.

This is most glaring in AI, where our capacity to engineer powerful AI systems has vastly outpaced our capacity to understand them. By building dialogue between the major disciplines studying natural and artificial intelligences, our project will produce a roadmap for Accelerating Research Collaboration on Artificial and Natural Intelligences (ARCANI). To create this roadmap, ARCANI will link several international research networks, drawing on insights and conversations that cross disciplines, career stages, and countries. The integration of these research networks will also help diversify participation in the study of natural and artificial intelligences. It will train a cohort of early career researchers in new ways of doing science and international collaboration. Through the existing Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute, the ARCANI team has an excellent record of fostering collaboration and leadership amongst researchers from underrepresented groups and developing nations. ARCANI allows us to scale up our efforts, improving training, collaboration opportunities, and skill development for young scholars across many disciplines. The ARCANI roadmap will lead to the development of theoretical foundations spanning from animal behavior to AI. It will establish a vibrant trading zone for sharing novel methods, data, and computational frameworks. And it will translate foundational concepts and empirical insights into practical technologies.

We will link networks in ethology, complexity science, comparative cognition, neuroscience, robotics, and AI, with nodes in every habitable continent. We have identified three promising areas for accelerated advance through network-to-network collaboration: (1) theoretical foundations of intelligence (DEFINE); (2) leveraging the data revolution to redesign the study of cognition (DESIGN); and (3) naturalistic approaches to AI and robotics (DEPLOY). Each area will be explored by a cross-network working group, holding several virtual meetings and one in-person meeting. Early career researchers (ECRs, including grad students and postdocs) will play a prominent role; the Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute (DISI) will help recruit diverse and exceptionally gifted ECRs. Working groups will address three questions: WHAT are the gaps in existing knowledge? WHO in their networks is best positioned to come together to address them? HOW can AccelNet support sustainable international collaboration to close those gaps? These questions will drive surveys of existing research, definition of key concepts, and frank assessment of barriers. Working groups will summarize their findings in white papers, which we will publish as agenda-setting documents.

Most of this literature focuses on cyberattack prevention and less on dealing with attacks aimed at bypassing the detection stage. Hence, this research will study reaction mechanisms to remediate incidents on power systems that are caused by cyberattacks bypassing the detection stage. The developed remedial action frameworks in this project will yield new insights that will be valuable to researchers/engineers working on resilience improvement for smart distribution systems against non-detectable cyberattacks. The outcomes of this research will be shared with professional engineers (PEs) via industry seminars, providing professional development hours and updating their knowledge on vulnerability of power systems to cyberattacks. In addition, the project will broaden participation in engineering through summer workshops to involve K-12 students from underrepresented groups for the purpose of diversifying the STEM leaders for modern operation of the U.S power grid.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to address the following research issue: ?How to react to cyberattacks on the load tap changing (LTC) mechanism of autotransformers within power distribution systems to tackle an intended voltage collapse.? Within this scope, the first objective of the research is to investigate vulnerability of LTCs to cyberattacks targeting voltage collapse in distribution systems. Reaching this objective for a distribution system operator will result in a sophisticated attack model that bypasses state estimation-based bad data detection, based on which realistic remedial actions can be developed. The second objective is to design primary/backup reaction mechanisms to mitigate the voltage collapse resulting from the attacked LTCs. To attain this objective, several algorithms will be created to design a primary remediation technique based on distribution network reconfiguration customized by a deep learning framework. The primary reaction scheme will be supported by a backup electricity market-based mechanism, where distributed synchronous generators will optimally contribute to mitigation of cyberattacks in the regions of the system not fully alleviated by network reconfiguration. Finally, the third objective of this research is to perform hardware-in-the-loop experimental validation of the proposed remedial actions on a lab-scale smart microgrid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to investigate non-scattering features of inhomogeneous media in a homogeneous free space and explore their potential applications to inverse scattering as well as invisibility, or cloaking, which can be used to make objects undetectable or unimpacted by certain waves. In addition, graduate and undergraduate student will be mentored as part of this project, which will add both depth and breadth to their mathematical education.<br/> <br/>Despite recent progress concerning some special geometries, the existence or nonexistence of nonscattering wavenumbers for general inhomogeneities largely remains an open question. This project aims to explore the non-scattering behavior of inhomogeneous media by addressing several challenges. The specific goals of this work are to (1) characterize necessary conditions for inhomogeneities and waves to be nonscattering, or the opposite, to be nontrivially scattering, (2) mathematically construct nonscattering media and waves, (3) establish quantitative results on nonscattering wavenumbers for a general class of inhomogeneities, and (4) apply results of nonscattering and/or nontrivial scattering to inverse problems for uniquely determining the shape of an unknown medium by one single measurement.

In the seminal model by Holmström and Milgrom (1987), a principal (she) is imperfectly informed about the actions of an agent (he) on a random process representing the value of a project over time. To incentivize the agent to act in her best interest, she can offer him a contract, namely a terminal payment indexed on the value of the project. These problems are fundamentally related to the design of optimal incentives and are therefore present in a wide variety of situations, including not only economics but also politics, finance, etc. Although this theory has been extended to allow the principal to contract with many agents, the possibility that agents may be impacted by common hazards and risks is currently mostly neglected. This research focuses on the development of principal-agent problems to incorporate the fact that the agents may live in a common uncertain environment and may interact with each other but also with this environment. This research theme is motivated by several concrete applications, where this common uncertain environment cannot be neglected when looking for the optimal actions or incentives to implement, e.g., optimization of electricity production and consumption, regulation of financial and systemic risks, or design of optimal and sustainable insurance policies. The themes are at the heart of current economical and societal challenges, both nationally and internationally. Studying them in a quantitative way can therefore help inform public policy, and thus contribute to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes. This research will also have an essential mentoring orientation, involving graduate students from the Operations Research & Financial Engineering Graduate Program, who will be partially supported by the funds awarded.<br/><br/>Considering a common random environment induces a wide range of additional mathematical difficulties, which have only been recently addressed, albeit only for pure mean-field games. To address this type of general problem, technical results will be further developed, notably on second order backward stochastic differential equations (2BSDEs), which are typically used to determine the optimal form of contracts in principal-agent problems. To consider general multi-agent problems with Nash or mean-field interactions, it is necessary to develop generalized notions of 2BSDEs, namely multidimensional or mean-field 2BSDEs. Moreover, even in a classical framework, the idea of considering common jumps in a multi-agent or mean-field setting has never been investigated, despite its relevance to model collective accidents such as climatic hazards and will involve the study of (multidimensional or mean-field) 2BSDEs with jumps. Finally, with the idea of ensuring the implementation of realistic contracts, a principal?s problem with constraints on the contract can be reformulated as a stochastic target problem. These theoretical developments will considerably advance knowledge in the field of 2BSDE and more broadly of stochastic control and will allow the study of the various applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The northernmost of these wind gaps is the ?Tehuantepec Gap? (along the southwest coast of Mexico). These locally known winds (here simply Tehuantepec Gap Winds) drive intense upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich water in the Gulf primarily in the winter when high atmospheric pressures over North America establish a pressure gradient across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Despite the potential importance of the Tehuantepec Gap Winds as an Atlantic-Pacific teleconnection, there has been no attempt to predict the response of these winds to changes in regional climate dynamics in the context of rapid and global climate change. The researchers suggest to combine past climate records of upwelling (from sedimentary radiocarbon over the last 30.000 years) and model simulations to characterize atmospheric dynamical processes over the North Atlantic, and to examine both the sensitivity of these winds to ?upstream? factors as well as the ?downstream? implications of this inter-basin coupling. A novel Atlantic-Pacific Ocean-atmosphere feedback mechanism is suggesting in the methodological framework and hypothesis testing of this project in which the Tehuantepec Gap Winds and atmospheric Rossby waves play a central role. This collaborative project will support two early career scientists, and the education and scientific training of undergraduate students at UC Irvine (both a Hispanic Serving Institution and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution). The researchers will continue engagement in their institution? broadening participation efforts, including ATOC REU in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Cryospheric Sciences (NSF 2150262), a program that primarily recruits from Hispanic Serving Institutions to introduce students to data science and geoscience research. Additionally, a lesson plan focused on long-term variations in Earth?s climate will be developed as part of this project and piloted through Environmental Climate Change and Literacy Projects in California?s outreach programs and posted in an openly available national online repository for climate pedagogy (called ?Subject to Climate?).<br/><br/>The Gulf of Tehuantepec is an ideal location to characterize ?upstream? atmospheric processes linking the Pacific and Atlantic sectors because a prominent gap in the Sierra Madre mountains forces low-level winds to flow through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec toward the Pacific, driving local upwelling of deeper, lower radiocarbon waters to the surface. A preliminary model results and sediment core measurements leverage this wind-to-radiocarbon relationship to provide a precious constraint on Northern Hemisphere atmospheric dynamics over the past 23,000-years. Previous studies of contemporary climate variability and preliminary examinations of models and observational products indicate that higher atmospheric pressure over North America is associated with high near-surface pressure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to stronger Tehuantepec winds. The project suggested here?including new sediment proxy measurements, model (Paleoclimate GCM) and data product examinations, and forward modeling?aims to discover the driving mechanisms behind the variability in Tehuantepec gap wind strength over paleoclimate timescales, which will provide a crucial new constraint on glacial-interglacial atmospheric dynamics in addition to controls on tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperature and inter-basin moisture fluxes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project will investigate the evolution of selfish begging behavior in birds through muscle physiology and genomics. For many animals, survival is most challenging immediately after hatching/birth and natural selection strongly favors the evolution of extreme (and sometimes bizarre) behavioral traits at this stage to enhance offspring survival. One example of this is begging to receive care in nestling birds. The Fellow will study how begging evolved and characterize how selfish traits promote competition among offspring by applying behavioral, genomic, and physiological techniques to nestling birds raised with chicks they are related to or unrelated to. The Fellow, as a former teacher, will also conduct outreach on the relationship between muscle physiology and behavior at local schools and mentor undergraduate students both at the host institution and from minority-serving institutions.<br/><br/>The process by which traits evolve iteratively over time and support the diversification of behavioral phenotypes is of critical importance to generating a mechanistic understanding of behavior. This is particularly interesting in the case of early life traits, which are theorized to be under a stronger selective force than those traits that manifest after first reproduction. Begging in nestling birds is a model system for addressing questions of iterative evolution because it is well-studied from a behavioral perspective. However, little is known about the molecular and physiological mechanisms that facilitate/constrain begging as a behavior or how iterative trait evolution guides the transition from specialized begging directed at parents to a generalized parasitic begging phenotype that may be successful at coercing care in a variety of host species nests. The goal of this research combines an emerging model of layered evolution, where the innovation of behavioral traits can be modeled by looking at molecular shifts in the expression of individual genes and how it builds on ancestral evolutionary scaffold, with physiological methods like in situ muscle recording to explore the basis of mechanistic constraints on begging evolution.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. In many reptiles, whether an individual develops as a male or a female depends upon the temperatures that they experienced while developing inside the egg. There is increased urgency to understand the biological mechanisms of this process, as a warming climate will likely influence these processes at both individual and population levels. Even though this developmental system has been studied since the 1960s, we still know very little about how exactly temperature influences this development and the survival of these species. It remains unknown 1) how the same temperature produces opposite outcomes across different species and 2) how temperatures experienced while developing in the egg affect the probability of survival. This research will directly advance our understanding of mechanisms regulating the development of male and female reptiles and will inform conservation efforts aimed at vulnerable populations and species. The fellow will be trained in genomic techniques and modeling and will also broaden participation in science by presenting the research to local schools in an economically disadvantaged area. <br/><br/>The temperature-dependence of female or male phenotype represents a straightforward case of developmental plasticity, in which the temperature experienced during discrete developmental windows dictates this development. Whereas the molecular and genetic responses to similar thermal cues appear to be conserved, the resultant developmental outcomes vary across species. For example, cool temperatures lead to the upregulation of conserved chromatin modifiers in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) and the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), but these temperatures produce males in T. scripta and females in A. mississippiensis. The first objective of this research will use ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq approaches to test the hypothesis that chromatin modifiers interact with different genetic loci across the turtle and crocodilian genome to produce species-specific reaction norms. Second, recent theoretical and empirical data support the idea that incubation temperature-mediated effects on male vs female survival to maturity underlie the adaptive value of developmental plasticity. Using recapture efforts after incubating A. mississippiensis eggs in the lab at different fluctuating temperatures representing future warming scenarios, the second objective of this research is aimed at addressing how increasingly warm climates will affect crocodilian male: female ratios, attendant population structures, and, ultimately the adaptive value of this temperature-dependent developmental plasticity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New proof-of-concept stalagmites from JX Cave, Mexico, cover a time period from approximately 53,000 to 105,000 years before present (BP), and a new sample from Sistema Huatla, Mexico spans 115,000 to 340,000 years BP. <br/><br/>The preliminary data from these samples departs from a smooth sinusoidal orbital insolation hypothesis, and instead shows abrupt threshold-like behavior including monsoon collapses apparently coincident with Heinrich events in the North Atlantic, notably during the relatively warm interval of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5b.  The research will focus on weak monsoon intervals during non-glacial warm periods such as MIS 5, 7, and 9, because these times may represent paleo-analogs of future aridity associated with the projected weakening of ocean circulation due to anthropogenic climate change.<br/><br/>Why this research and why now? The prevailing orbital monsoon hypothesis describes a strong and positively coupled relationship between summer incoming solar radiation (insolation) on orbital precession (21,000 year) timescales and regional monsoon strength. Long monsoon paleoclimate records are revealed in the inverse correlation between regional scale monsoon strength and speleothem oxygen isotope values. The orbital control on monsoons is strongly expressed in the East Asian and South American monsoon systems where speleothem oxygen isotope time series show smooth sinusoidal variations that are paced by orbital insolation.  However, in other tropical areas the orbital insolation hypothesis fails to explain hydroclimate variations, notably in Central America, where speleothem oxygen isotope does not correlate to summer insolation.  This disconnect suggests that paleoclimate variations in southern Mexico and Central America (Mesoamerica) may be explained by the orbital monsoon hypothesis.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include supporting a graduate student training and engaging students from historical underrepresented groups students in Nevada and also at Fort Valley State University, an Historical Black College and University (HBCU) in Georgia.

Clots are essential to stopping bleeding from a wound, but also can be dangerous if they improperly block a blood vessel causing, for example, a heart attack or stroke. Decades of research have led to an understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology of clot formation, but how clots are affected by the mechanical forces of blood flow is not well understood. Clots that cause heart attack and stroke often form in flowing blood, thus understanding how the flow forces  affect clot formation may be important to preventing or treating these conditions.

Graphene oxide membranes are identified with auxetic behavior, which make them excellent candidate for a wide range of promising separation and filtration applications in the biomedical, automobile, and defense industries, and for clean energy. However, there is still a limited understanding of the underlying mechanism in their auxetic behavior.

This project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students at Union College, especially those from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. These research experiences will prepare students for scientific and technical careers, and/or graduate studies in nanotechnology-based industries. In addition, the research will be integrated into Union?s mechanical engineering curriculum to improve engineering education. <br/><br/>The objectives of this project are two-fold: 1) to achieve a fundamental understanding of the auxetic behavior of graphene oxide membranes by conducting experiments based on two hypotheses - the ?wrinkle? and/or the ?auxetic framework? are responsible for the behavior, and 2) to investigate how negative Poisson ratio customization affects the mechanical properties, stability, permeability, and potential applications of the membranes. Specifically, this experimental research will explore the relationship between the negative Poisson ratio and the size, orientation, and deformation of wrinkles, as per the ""wrinkle"" hypothesis. It will also investigate the correlation between the negative Poisson ratio and the oxygen/carbon atomic ratio of the ""auxetic framework"" hypothesis. By combining experimental studies and dynamic analyses, this project aims to not only identify the structural basis of graphene oxide membrane's auxetic behavior but also devise techniques for customizing this behavior to address a range of engineering challenges.

These elements replace toxic elements that are commonly used in semiconducting nanoparticles, such as cadmium, with more benign ones, such as copper, indium and zinc. However, much less is known about how to control the optical and electronic properties of nanoparticles incorporating these elements. Heyes, Coridan and their students are addressing this lack of knowledge by systematically varying the chemical synthesis of the nanoparticles and analyzing how this affects the resulting atomic structure and, in turn, the optical and electronic properties. These discoveries could lead to new materials for use in light emitting diodes, lasers, solar energy conversion, catalysis, chemical/biochemical sensors, and biomedical imaging. This support will also be used to help recruit and train underrepresented and first generation undergraduate students through summer workshops to be held at the University of Arkansas.<br/><br/>Under this award, Drs.

Zinc is known to ion exchange with copper and indium in the CuInE2 lattice to form alloyed Cu(Zn)InE2 QDs or with silver and indium in the AgInE2 lattice to form alloyed Ag(Zn)InE2 QDs.

Upon activation these catalysts are capable of promoting a number of chemical reactions. In contrast to this work, most visible light-activated reactions require catalysts that contain precious metals or halogen atoms and therefore are not considered to be environmentally sustainable. With a focus on overcoming this limitation, the collaborative Mani/Esipova team is employing computational modeling to design and optimize their catalysts and will subsequently test them in light-driven transformations. In addition to all of this, this research program is providing valuable opportunities for students. Undergraduate and graduate students that are involved in this work, including students who have been historically underrepresented in the sciences, are developing intellectually while building skill sets that lie at the intersection of synthetic organic chemistry and physical chemistry. Such training is valuable for their future careers, be it in academia or industry.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop a new family of organic heavy atom?free photoredox catalysts that contain a general motif that consists of orthogonal electron donor-acceptor aromatic chromophores. Generally speaking, photocatalysts absorb light and create electronically excited states that facilitate electron transfer reactions in a mild and controlled manner; as a result, they can produce highly reactive intermediates that lead to value-added bond-forming events. Most currently utilized photoredox catalysts employ halogens or precious metals to enhance the production of these excited states. The photoredox catalysts that are developed in this study not only take advantage of an underexplored photophysical phenomenon to produce excited states in pi-conjugated organic molecules, but they avoid the use of heavy atoms including metals and halogens. The research is demonstrating the unique properties and versatility of this new class of organic photoredox catalysts. This research is expected to establish structure-function correlations of donor-acceptor molecules in terms of the efficiency of the generation of the excited state and the associated catalytic activity.

One factor that is critical to building psychological safety is leader behavior. Most of the research has failed to consider that psychological safety may be cultivated in unique ways for employees who are members of socially disadvantaged groups, particularly for those in intersecting demographic categories who often experience unique challenges based on their intersecting social identities. Given the workforce has become increasingly diverse, building understanding of how leaders can best cultivate psychological safety among these groups of employees is a critical step to fully realizing the advantages of a workforce in which employees feel psychologically safe. As such, the project team is collecting data to support the development of actionable, evidence-based interventions that will help managers develop communication and leadership skills that effectively cultivate psychological safety of employees.

Over the past decade, the region has experienced repeated and extreme heatwaves that profoundly impacted marine ecosystems and adjacent terrestrial systems.  Yet, considerable uncertainty exists as to northeastern Pacific climate variability prior to the 1900s and the extent to which current climate is atypical.<br/><br/>Foremost, this research aims to reconstruct northeast Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperatures as a significant forcing mechanism of climate and climate variability in Earth?s climate system but which is relatively poorly constrained by instrumental observations, paleoclimate data, and general climate circulation models.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to address lingering questions regarding poor agreement among earlier tree-ring reconstructions and the possibility of time variant linkages across marine and terrestrial systems.  Moreover, long-term relationships between the extratropical and tropical Pacific region will be assessed by integrating coral records and existing reconstructions of the El Niño Southern Oscillation.

A critical gap is the lack of consistent year-round observational measurements of the subpolar Southern Ocean. This workshop will facilitate community discussion concerning (1) key scientific and logistic needs to sustain the US?s leadership in Antarctic oceanography; (2) promising new observational approaches that extend measurements into traditionally limited winter periods; (3) ways to strengthen the research community, both by enhancing participation from traditionally underrepresented groups (including early career researchers) and improving the level coordination with international partners. The workshop, while primarily focused on physical oceanography, will convene researchers from various Southern Ocean subdisciplines and ensure participation that reflects the diversity of the broader scientific community.

This project will support the development and analysis of new techniques for biomedical imaging, integrating the work of specialists in applied mathematics, physics and biomedical engineering, as well as practitioners in biomedical imaging companies. Models for shear wave elasticity imaging will be developed and analyzed, which provides novel, pertinent, non-invasive biomarkers for early disease characterization and therapy follow-up. This technique also enables one to decipher which structural component contributes to the global mechanical tissue behavior, and this fundamental new understanding opens the gateway to quantify the vascular organization of tissue at the 10-100?m-scale via clinically available imaging methods. Abnormal vascular fabric is a key prognostic factor in cancer therapy, and its quantification for patient stratification and response to therapy has significant potential. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>A main objective of the project is to further the theory that describes the statistical structure of wave fields propagating through complex media, as well as use the theory in the context of classical and new applications for waves in random media. There is a focus on understanding waves in short- and long-range random media as well as with fractional governing equations, which is in part motivated by its relevance in tissue modeling. This media has a statistical structure with only power law decay of correlations, with such structure referred to as heavy tailed medium fabric.  The analysis also exploits scale separations and involves scaling limits for stochastic differential equations. Novel techniques will be developed for differentiating between scattering effects and attenuation, which is a classical challenge for wave propagation while also having direct applications. In the context of biomedical imaging, such differentiation is important for proper tissue classification. New theory will also be developed for modeling waves with complex nonlinear contrast. A better understanding of propagation and mode coupling along boundaries as well as the transmission through and reflection from rough boundaries will be established for waves in random media.

Despite the significance of ROMP in producing a plethora of functional polymers, existing techniques still cannot completely prevent chain transfer and termination, in particular when low-strain monomers are involved.  As a result, mixtures of linear and cyclic macromolecules of different sizes are formed that are difficult to separate.  This research endeavors to directly address this unmet challenge and introduce a distinct strategy for processive ROMP.  In this strategy, polymerization catalysts will be encapsulated in molecularly defined cage structures, such that, ideally only monomers, but not nascent polymers, can access the catalyst.  This will thereby inhibit the chain transfer and termination caused by the interaction between the catalyst and the nascent polymer, resulting in linear macromolecules with controlled molecular weights.  The developed methodology will also be applied to ROMP of sustainability-oriented monomers that are considered challenging for ROMP due to their low strain. These monomers include cyclic alkenes with low ceiling temperatures and those consisting of degradable functionalities.  This research will provide interdisciplinary training for students in polymer synthesis and sustainability.  The collaborative team will additionally develop a hybrid three-week summer workshop aimed to introduce polymer chemistry principles and practices into 3D-printing. The workshop will be integrated with existing outreach programs to stimulate interest in polymer science and catalysis among college and high school students in the communities served by Boston College and Iowa State University.<br/><br/>Synthetic polymers ranging from commodity products to specialty goods are at the center of modern society. Among many properties, molecular weight, sequence, and dispersity are essential in determining the material performance of polymers. Therefore, the precise control over these properties is the central goal in modern synthetic polymer chemistry.  This research will focus on developing processive ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of low-strain cyclic alkenes through confining organometallic ruthenium catalysts into molecularly defined cages.  Such an approach is expected to allow access to monomer molecules but prevent the nascent polymer chains from accessing these confined catalysts.  As a result, well-defined, high, and ultra-high molecular weight, low dispersity polymers from ROMP could be realized.  The first objective will focus on design of homogeneous and heterogeneous Zr-based cages using the reversable aperture opening/closing approach.  These cages will then be utilized to encapsulate ruthenium-based Grubbs and Hoveyda-Grubbs ROMP catalysts.  The second objective will leverage molecularly confined catalysts to enable polymerization of sustainability-oriented monomers containing degradable functionalities.  Lastly, kinetic behaviors of ROMP mediated by molecularly confined catalysts will be systematically investigated. The basic guiding principles associated with this project are general and have the potential to be applied to various other catalyst-mediated chain-growth polymerization techniques in which the control of termination and/or chain-transfer events is desirable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The observed increases in air temperatures and atmospheric moisture content over Greenland have significant implications for the region?s climate. These changes have altered the frequency, type, and total amount of precipitation falling on the Greenland Ice Sheet and increased the likelihood of extreme heatwaves and melt events that directly affect sea and land ice growth and loss rates in and around the region. Despite the notable warming and moistening atop Greenland, the driving mechanisms behind these recent trends are poorly understood. Research to date has been inconclusive on whether local oceanic and atmospheric processes, broader-scale mechanisms in the climate system, or a combination of these multiscale factors are attributable to sustaining the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with Greenland?s warming and moistening. A more complete understanding of these complex climate system interactions is essential to improving climate model physics and more accurately capturing Greenland?s ice sheet changes and resulting global impacts, like sea-level rise.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis for this project is that low frequency, high-latitude circulation variability is sensitive to multiple processes, including anthropogenic, remote, and local climate forcings. Through statistical and diagnostic analyses of historical, atmospheric data, and climate model experiments from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1 and 2 and model output from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the project will rigorously test this hypothesis while addressing several knowledge gaps in Greenland hydroclimate research guided by three main questions: 1) what natural climate and anthropogenic forcings associated with local ocean-atmosphere processes are the strongest controls of the Greenland region?s summer circulation variability and air temperature and moisture on interannual-to-interdecadal time scales?; 2) how do large-scale circulation variability and associated processes regulate weather-to-seasonal mean time scale moisture over the Greenland region?; and 3) how reliable are CESM2 and CMIP6 models in replicating observed circulation changes over Greenland and associated impacts on temperature and moisture?

Cyclic peptides and their surrogates are valuable in research in that they serve as leads in drug discovery, as probe compounds in chemical biology and as building blocks for materials science. Harran and co-workers are developing new synthetic tools to create a previously unknown class of fluorinated cyclic peptide composites. They are both studying the three-dimensional structure of these constructs and their physical properties. Their methods platform is able to generate new molecules systematically, and it has the potential to drive many collaborative studies in the future. This project spans a broad range of chemical disciplines from synthesis to chemical biology to medicine and the outcomes will affect the chemical, pharmaceutical, and materials industries. Consequently, this work is well suited for training and educating young scientists who will go on to careers in these STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>The Harran research team at UCLA has discovered that peptides containing combinations of cysteine, tyrosine, histidine, and serine residues react with octafluorocyclopentene (OFCP) in relative rate controlled polysubstitution cascades. These multi-stage reactions convert linear, unprotected substrates into polycyclic products in a single flask at 0-25 ?C without the use of catalysts or heavy metals. The chemistry is generating a wealth of previously unknown heterocyclic ring systems. Under this award, functional group compatibilities, ring size tolerances and the manner in which relative rate differentials govern efficiency will be examined. The stability, solubility and conformational behavior of macrobicyclic products will also be studied. Initiating reaction cascades from branching positions will be tested as will variants designed to generate a new class of fluorinated ?pseudo?-biaryls. Lastly, methods to augment the scaffolding abilities of OFCP with molecular inserts to facilitate additional macrocyclizations via transient reactive intermediates will be explored. The overarching goal of this work is to develop technology that will enable the synthesis of new membrane permeant structural mimics of the major protein surface loop types observed in the Protein Data Bank.  If successful, the OFCP-stapling chemistry being developed herein will provide an enabling tool of potentially wide utility in chemical biology. particularly for the burgeoning cyclic peptide field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, most elementary teachers have little preparation in teaching engineering. Additionally, elementary teachers increasingly provide instruction for students who are still learning English as an additional language. However, teachers receive uneven preparation related to instruction for multilingual learners. This project addresses these critical needs through development of a standards-aligned professional learning model for elementary teachers of multilingual learners. This interdisciplinary approach is innovative in its effort to provide teachers with sustained time to reflect on what they believe about language, their teaching of linguistically and racially minoritized students, and their interactions with multilingual students around engineering content. Using a participatory and collaborative approach, experts in literacy, language, and engineering will work with elementary teachers to develop strategies for how teachers can view students? multilingualism as an asset to engineering. This asset-based approach has wider implications as teachers? shifting language beliefs may result in the creation of learning environments that provide linguistically minoritized students with expanded opportunities for identifying with engineering as a discipline or tool for understanding other STEM subjects. <br/><br/>This three-year Exploratory Project will engage elementary teachers (n = 18) in a sustained professional learning community to learn about engineering content and pedagogy and explore the intersections of race and language surrounding engineering education. By noticing how languages are positioned in their classroom, teachers will be able to develop strategies for re-positioning the linguistic, cultural, and representational contributions of multilingual students as core intellectual resources within their classrooms. Using design-based research with an emphasis on qualitative data generation and analysis through positioning and language ideologies, this study will explore: 1) whether and how teachers? language ideologies shifted in relation to specific elements of the professional learning experience, 2) how teachers? language ideologies mapped onto their engineering pedagogies, and 3) how these pedagogies offered (or failed to offer) multilingual students with discursive resources for identifying with engineering. Triangulated analyses of results from validated instruments, as well as observational, interview, and reflective video data, will result in robust research regarding elements of professional learning experiences that contribute to linguistically inclusive engineering pedagogies. This project will result in a standards-aligned professional learning model for teachers of multilingual learners, as well as multimedia curricular materials for educators and guides for providers of teacher professional development. The project has potential to contribute to increased quality of teaching and increased time on teaching of engineering. It will also contribute to positive stances toward students? linguistic and racial backgrounds since the professional learning model, curricular materials, and strategies that it will create will be shared with other elementary teachers who are striving to teach science and engineering to students who are linguistically and racially diverse. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important class of multi-physics problems are those of fluid-structure interactions (FSI) which involve an object governed by solid mechanics interacting with a fluid (e.g. a turbine interacting with the wind). Having reliable and efficient computer models for these problems are vital to understanding different natural physical systems and essential engineering problems. FSI problems are modeled mathematically by coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). Sophisticated numerical methods have been developed to approximate solutions of individual PDEs. However, the development of the state-of-the-art numerical methods for coupled PDEs remains a challenging task and continues to be a highly active and dynamic area of research. Training of at least one graduate student on the topics of the project is expected.<br/><br/>As part of this effort, the development of provably stable higher-order splitting methods for FSI problems will be pursued. Splitting methods take advantage of fine-tuned numerical methods for fluid problems and  solid problems. One solves each problem separately and they communicate via boundary conditions. The challenge is to make the methods both stable and higher-order accurate. Indeed, most of the numerical methods that are provably stable are low order accurate in time.

This project aims to develop private algorithms for several fundamental problems in graph mining and network science, that can scale to networks of the size that arise in real-world applications and provide good accuracy bounds.

The project will investigate multiple forms of energy, including lasers, radiofrequency, and ultrasonic waves. The project will create energy-based sensing modes that probe anatomical structures with a low-energy beam to determine their shape and thermal properties. These measurements, which can be updated in real-time even during a procedure, will allow safer and more precise removal of diseased tissue. Initially, all functions will be performed by command of a surgeon but because a robot is capable of reacting much faster than a human, the eventual goal of the project is to enable autonomous implementation of certain procedures. Energy-based surgical robots have the potential to improve public health by reducing surgical invasiveness, recovery times, and treatment costs, and by enabling entirely new procedures for life-threatening conditions that are currently considered inoperable. Participation of undergraduate and graduate students in this project will contribute to the training of the nation?s next generation of surgical robotics engineers.<br/> <br/>This research project will support the creation of a new framework of perception and control techniques to enable surgical robots that monitor and regulate the thermal effects created by their energy-based end effectors.

Expected scientific contributions include (1) new perception techniques that efficiently integrate thermal sensing, imaging, and physics-based simulations to infer critical patient information; (2) new control algorithms that leverage this enhanced perception to automatically regulate energy delivery and so achieve prescribed outcomes in the presence of uncertainty; and (3), strategies to appropriately integrate human operators into the control of robotic energy-based instruments. The expected long-term impact of this work will be to extend understanding of the interactions of robots with their environments beyond the analysis and control of contact forces, to incorporate non-contact functionality enabled by energy-based heat exchange and the control of structural temperatures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current theories and models used to predict fracture are based on an incomplete picture of the fracture process, which lead to inaccurate predictions of crack growth, making it difficult to design engineering structures and next-generation structural metals. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports research to develop better material models used in the design of fracture-resistant engineering structures relevant to energy, defense, aerospace, and transportation applications, thereby supporting the U.S. economy and defense. The machine learning methods developed under this project will be broadly applicable to many fields of science and engineering. Through a collaboration with local and national science teaching organizations, the research findings from this project will be used to develop a multi-day lesson-plan for the high school science classroom wherein students learn about fracture of metals using computer simulations. This lesson-plan will be made available to science teachers nationwide.  <br/><br/>Prevailing theories of metal fracture focus on either the crack tip where dislocation nucleation governs the propensity for brittle fracture, or the plastic zone surrounding the crack tip where plastic dissipation governs the fracture toughness. Recent work has shown, however, that there are important interplays between the crack tip and plastic zone which affect various fracture behaviors such as dislocation multiplication and growth of fatigue cracks. This project is to develop a three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics model which simultaneously accounts for the crack tip and the plastic zone by capturing all relevant dislocation and bond-breaking processes in one unified model. To achieve this goal, a physics-informed machine learning-based image solver will be developed which utilizes a new convolutional architecture that couples to the finite element method. Atomistic simulations will be used to quantify the dislocation nucleation rate near the crack tip, grain boundary weakening due to dislocation adsorption and/or emission, and grain boundary decohesion. Predictions from the fracture model will be compared with state-of-the-art fracture experiments.

Although error-controlled lossy compressors have been employed to mitigate these data issues, many scientists still feel reluctant to adopt them because these compressors provide no guarantee on the accuracy of downstream analysis results derived from raw data. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a trust-driven lossy data compression infrastructure capable of strictly controlling the errors in downstream analysis theoretically and practically to facilitate the use of data reduction in scientific applications. Success of this project will promote the progress of science in multiple disciplines via effective data reduction, and contribute to resolving important societal problems including electric generation, weather forecasting, material design, and transportation. Moreover, this project will contribute to the growth and development of future generations of scientists and engineers through educational and engagement activities, including development of new curriculum and recruitment of K-12 students.<br/><br/>Existing lossy compression techniques either overlook error quantification or provide error control only for raw data, leaving uncertainties in the outcome of downstream quantities of interest (QoIs) computed from the raw data. This greatly concerns many computational scientists who wish to reduce their data while preserving necessary information, preventing them from adopting lossy compression in their applications. This research will address these problems through an integration of theory and implementation via three tasks. First, a novel theory enabling error control on downstream QoIs will be developed. This will fundamentally address the trustability issues of existing error controlled lossy compressors that provide error control only on raw data. Second, an optimization method ensuring tight error control will be applied based on rigorous analysis, to achieve higher compression ratios under the same requirements. Third, a scalable infrastructure will be built through a careful integration with advanced compression frameworks and tailored parallelization based on target QoIs, in order to take full advantage of existing compression algorithms and computational patterns in the target QoIs. The project will enable application scientists to store the most valuable information in their data based on their unique needs, creating opportunities for novel findings in multiple scientific disciplines including climatology, cosmology, and seismology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A proposed reconciliation is that during late stages of Snowball Earth with high CO2, ice-sheets could respond to orbital forcing leading to a more active hydrological cycle.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Urbanization and climate change are rapidly altering habitats, forcing wildlife to either undergo local adaptation, leave, or risk extinction. Amphibians are one of the most threatened groups by both urbanization and climate change; however, amphibians are understudied in evolutionary biology and genomics. Therefore, the northern two-lined salamander, Eurycea bislineata, will be used to better understand the genomic and phenotypic (trait) consequences of urbanization and environmental change. By simultaneously measuring traits and analyzing the genome, the fellow will link genes and traits responsible for local adaptation to provide critical insight into how genomes give rise to complex traits. Through this research, the fellow will develop a long-term species monitoring program that provides essential data on the impact of urbanization on wild populations and offers a unique field biology experience to undergraduate students. Furthermore, the fellow will use the research to mentor undergraduate and graduate students while developing accessible and relevant educational materials for children, adolescents, and adults.<br/><br/>Using a hierarchical design, E. bislineata will be sampled from urban, suburban, and rural areas that differ in the local climate. After assembling and annotating the genome with long-read sequencing technology, physiological traits, and 3-D morphology will be collected from each salamander prior to whole genome sequencing. Using that data, the fellow will quantify phenotypic and genomic differentiation between populations before identifying genes potentially under selection and attempting to link the candidate genomic variants with ecologically relevant phenotypic traits. By first identifying genomic and phenotypic variation associated with urbanization and climate, the fellow increases their power to link candidate genes to traits.

This moduli space has many connections to other areas of mathematics and to physics (where the algebraic curves are the strings appearing in string theory). One way to study the moduli space of curves is via its intersection theory, the study of how certain loci in the moduli space (those corresponding to curves with specific properties) intersect each other. In this project, the PI will investigate various problems relating to a fundamental intersection-theoretic class on the moduli space of curves: the double ramification cycle. This project will also provide research opportunities for graduate students, who will be trained in the methods of the field.<br/><br/>The PI will study two main groups of problems dealing with the intersection theory of the moduli space of curves. First, the PI will develop improved formulas for the logarithmic double ramification cycle, a refinement of the double ramification cycle constructed and studied in the last several years by Holmes, Ranganathan, Schwarz, and others. The PI and his coauthors recently developed an approach to computing this cycle, and the primary goal of this project is to make this approach more effective so that it can be applied to localization computations in logarithmic geometry. Second, the PI will investigate assorted connections that have surfaced in recent years between the double ramification cycle and other tautological classes. This includes developing a theory of log tautological relations, defining and computing an orbifold version of the double ramification cycle, and attempting to prove a one-dimensional socle result for the tautological ring of the moduli space of bridgeless curves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant supports fundamental research that aims to create a new inkjet printing method to encapsulate ink in a liquid crystal substrate and eventually expands to a larger range of materials. If successful, the research outcomes will enable printing of advanced materials, including organic electronics for sensors and wearable devices, and benefit healthcare and energy sectors. The outreach and education activities involve students ranging from K-12 to undergraduate levels to stimulate interests in STEM fields, which will train the next generation of manufacturing workforce and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>Traditional inkjet printing requires ink materials with low viscosity and high ejection speed for the dispensing of ink droplets. On the other hand, low viscosity leads to droplets splashing on the receiving substrate and compromising the print resolution. As a result, there are limited combinations of ink properties and operating conditions that are ?printable.? Instead of dispensing the ink droplet onto conventional solid surfaces, this grant supports basic research that aims to understand the impact-induced ink release mechanism for ink chemicals embedded in a liquid crystal film. In this process, the ink is released onto the liquid crystal surface using droplet impacts to enable the inkjet printing of viscous materials. Theoretical analysis will be carried out to identify critical conditions required for the controlled release of the embedded ink in the liquid crystal film. Critical parameters that allow the design of the liquid crystal film and the control of the ink release will be identified using experiments to understand the effects of Weber number on ink release. If successful, this research will enable the printing of materials with controlled thickness and dimensions that were previously difficult or impossible to print, such as thermosetting and (semi)conducting polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developers engineer CI scripts, commonly called workflows or pipelines, to automate most software maintenance tasks, such as testing and deployment. Developers frequently misconfigure workflows resulting in severe security issues, which can have devastating effects resulting in supply-chain attacks. The extreme diversity of CI platforms and the supported features further exacerbate the problem and make it challenging to specify and verify security properties across different CI platforms uniformly. This project addresses the problem by defining the desired security properties of a workflow and developing platform-independent techniques to verify and enforce the security properties. Furthermore, this research will support the cross-disciplinary development of a diverse cohort of Ph.D. and undergraduate students, graduate-level courses, and a gamified training environment for workflow security analysis.<br/><br/>This project defines the required security properties of CI workflows and develops methods to verify and specify these properties. This requires techniques that can work in a platform-independent manner to handle the diversity of CI platforms. The project handles this through indirection by designing Workflow Intermediate Representation (WIR) and Workflow Specification Language (WSL). WIR and WSL enable platform-agnostic verification and specification of workflow security properties, respectively. The verification of security properties will be performed through Workflow Analysis Framework (WAF) that supports both static and dynamic analysis passes over workflows encoded in a platform-agnostic WIR. WSL, a domain-specific language, allows developers to specify workflows and their security properties in a platform-independent manner. Designing an effective WSL requires understanding developers' perspectives and challenges in engineering workflows and specifying security properties. In this context, this project performs necessary developer studies to gain insights about the above aspects. The project also develops a bidirectional compilation infrastructure for translating workflows from WSL to platform-specific versions, enabling compatibility with existing platforms.

For instance, the formation of solid-like gels at water-oil interfaces during oil recovery processes can be unfavorable because gel build-up can clog wells and pipelines. On the other hand, gel formation can actually be beneficial in flow diversion processes by diverting the flow away from porous rocks and enhancing oil recovery. The interface dynamics and morphologies of this open system cannot be predicted solely by an equilibrium phase diagram, and mathematical models and numerical simulations are needed to fully characterize the nonlinear, out-of-equilibrium dynamics.  This project aims to establish a computational framework for models of non-equilibrium phenomena, and design algorithms and experiments to investigate the interface dynamics of complex, reactive fluids. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training for students, and research activities will help develop the next generation of mathematicians, scientists and engineers. The team of PIs consists of the three researchers from three different institutions, where training of graduate students on the topics of the project is expected. <br/><br/>Studies of two or more fluids that are reactive, and flow through a porous medium, are fundamental to many fields. At equilibrium, the mixture may behave like a liquid or a gel (viscoelastic solid) depending on the concentrations of the components according to an equilibrium phase diagram. When driven out of equilibrium by, for instance, injection of one fluid into another, the morphology of the expanding interface between them can be very complex and strongly depends on an interplay between thermodynamic phase behavior and hydrodynamic forces. This project builds upon breakthroughs in modeling, computation, and experimental techniques to develop a unified mathematical framework that resolves the interface dynamics of reactive fluids driven out of equilibrium. Thermodynamically consistent equations governing the non-equilibrium dynamics of ternary reacting systems of immiscible fluids will be derived, focusing on the radial Hele-Shaw geometry as a prototype. Both sharp interface and diffuse interface numerical schemes (energy-stable, adaptive finite-difference methods using scalar auxiliary variables) will be developed and validated against asymptotic reductions to sharp interface models and new experimental data generated from this project. The integrated mathematical, computational and experimental approach will provide a framework for understanding the nonequilibrium dynamics, predicting the emergence of complex patterns and developing strategies for controlling the pattern formation process in fundamental multiphysics interface problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conjugated materials are ones where electrons are delocalized easily over extended distances. They play major roles as in organic electronic devices and displays, photocatalysis, bioimaging, and therapeutics. By introducing boron into a conjugated material its electronic structure can be altered, which can result in desirable properties, for example, the absorption and emission of near-infrared light and are important characteristics for bio-imaging and biotherapeutic applications. This research addresses the need to develop new methods to prepare such compounds in order, in the longer term, to fully leverage their favorable properties in applications such as electronic materials development and catalysis, and for deployment in biomedical applications. In addition to the training of undergraduate and graduate students, high school outreach programs are planned that allow students and their teachers, including those from underrepresented groups, to experience University research first-hand, learn about modern research tools, while also being introduced to career opportunities in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>The research project explores the functionalization of organic conjugated materials with boron-nitrogen (B-N) Lewis pairs as a means of tuning their electronic structure, photophysical properties, and chemical reactivity. In one direction, the research will target B-N Lewis pair-functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that feature reduced gaps between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. Such systems are expected to absorb or emit in the near-infrared region and/or exhibit electrochromic properties. In another direction, heteroaromatic systems will be explored as potential chromophores for photoredox catalysis. Finally, macrocycles are being developed that combine luminescent, oxygen-responsive, and host-guest properties. The results are expected to offer new fundamental insights into the properties of organic materials that are functionalized with B-N Lewis pairs while also contributing to the development of  luminescent, electrochromic, photocatalytic, host-guest, diagnostic and therapeutic materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Irregular or uncontrolled growth and assembly of cells leads to pathologies such as tumor formation and cancer. Additionally, model tissues grown in culture into functional cell clusters called organoids have been widely used in drug development and regenerative medicine, as well as in vitro studies of morphogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, and tissue repair. This award supports a combined experimental and computational project that will reveal the biomechanical principles that govern the assembly and organization of cells in epithelial tissue by studying spherical cell monolayers (called acini), which spontaneously collapse and evert polarity (i.e., where the acinus turns itself inside out) when induced to become more contractile. The final everted state is relevant to organoid applications where outer exposure of the apical surface is desired, and it also resembles acinar gland abnormalities in cancer. The knowledge gained from this study will be valuable to fundamental understanding of tissue development as well as control of the structure of cultured organoids. Thus, this project has broad potential impact on advancing human health, as the findings will be directly relevant to establishing the mechanical principles of tissue organization and development. It is also highly relevant to the biomanufacturing of organoids for drug testing, regenerative medicine, or models of disease. This project will support the training and mentorship of diverse graduate and undergraduate students, including students in the University of Florida Digital Arts program, who will render animations from three-dimensional imaging of acinus dynamics for outreach and education purposes.     <br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to understand the biomechanics of acinus stability and eversion using a synergistic combination of experimental and computational approaches. The first objective is to determine the contributions to cellular stresses that lead to mechanical equilibrium of the acinus, testing the hypothesis that surface tensions and/or the lumen pressure are regulated to sustain the acinus at the critical point between stable and unstable equilibrium states. A three-dimensional vertex-based mathematical model will be used to model the interacting cell population in the monolayer, accounting for the surface tensions and curvatures of the apical and basal cell surfaces and the cell-cell interfacial tension. The model will also account for the roles of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in the surface forces and interfacial energies. These parameters will be perturbed experimentally while tracking the 3D morphology of the acinus surfaces via high resolution confocal microscopy. The second objective is to understand how the acinus is perturbed from the equilibrium state and driven to contract and evert to a state of everted polarity, testing the hypothesis that the difference between and apical and basal surface tensions is the mechanical driving force for eversion. The eversion process will be simulated using a dynamic vertex/finite element model accounting for cell contractile and viscous forces, and it will be experimentally tested by triggering eversion via chemical perturbations (e.g. actomyosin activation, inhibition of ECM adhesion) and by laser ablation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the proliferation of EV sales, an educated technician workforce is needed to service these vehicles.  The national standards, certification, and curriculum developed with a prior award will inform this project to take the next step of expanding EV technician training to 15 two-year college automotive programs across the U.S. Implementing EV technician programs at two-year colleges not only addresses a critical workforce need for the EV industry, but it also provides low-barrier access to high-quality jobs for underserved populations. Many of the 15 two-year colleges who will develop EV programs as part of this project serve large numbers of minority students, female students, low-income students and rural students, and four colleges are designated as Minority Serving Institutions. <br/><br/>The NEVTEX Next consortium will create and test a model for addressing the need to educate the EV skilled technician workforce through four objectives: 1) 15 new 2-year college EV technician programs will be started and certified by providing professional development for instructors, providing industry-vetted EV curriculum and industry-recognized credentials, and supplying necessary testing equipment. 2) An advisory group will promote and sustain a national, industry-recognized EV certification for educators and technicians to advance standards-based EV certifications at 2-year colleges and in the EV workforce. 3) Five college automotive instructors will gain the EV technology knowledge and skills required to be certified in the national EVPro+ training and testing standards, and equipment will be provided at their colleges to establish five authorized EVPro+ certification testing sites. 4) Consortium-wide training based on proven and successful strategies will enable automotive faculty to develop effective student recruitment and retention strategies to increase diversity in their programs by attracting and retaining women and underserved minorities. EV programs launched at 15 geographically and demographically diverse 2-year colleges will help broaden the EV workforce for national impact. These capacity-building strategies will create a sustainable pipeline of diverse, certified EV technicians to more quickly grow an EV workforce and address the growing national need.

Because aromatic rings are a vital part of molecules that are used in medicine, agriculture, and technology, the discovery of new methods to incorporate them into molecules will serve to advance these societally important fields. This work will specifically target the use of arynes; namely, aromatic rings that contain a triple bond.  Arynes have a very reactive triple bond and can in reactions that conventional aromatic systems do not carry out. Two important areas that this work will focus on are 1) to reduce the waste traditionally associated with synthesizing arynes by employing simple and widely available feedstock chemicals, and 2) generating arynes using milder conditions than are used currently. In addition to the scientific benefits to academia and industry, this work will expand research opportunities for undergraduate students through the development of a CURE (course-based undergraduate research experiences) course. It will help to provide students with a formal education in the knowledge and skills that are needed for a career in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Additionally, outreach activities will help expand the representation of groups that have been historically marginalized in STEM.<br/><br/>An aryne is a highly reactive synthetic intermediate having a reaction profile that is distinct from the parent arene. This feature renders arynes useful for the diversification of aromatic rings that are found in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other synthetic materials. However, access to arynes remains either efficient or mild, but not both. Under this award, the Stuart group aims to develop new chemical reactions to access arynes from simple and widely available chemical building blocks using mild conditions to expand the functional group compatibility of arynes. The key innovation is to use ?onium? leaving groups that are to be installed in situ as more reactive precursors to arynes. Specifically, the team will use positively charged sulfur (sulfonium) and iodine (iodonium) leaving groups to achieve these transformations. The anticipated outcome of this research is that synthetic chemists will be equipped to expand the chemical space of arenes in ways not previously possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These experiments test predictions that fluid mixing can synchronize the growth of microbial colonies, similar to the rapid ?blooming? of algae in the oceans; that mixing patterns in the flow can affect the formation of biofilms on surfaces; that the combination of swimming and the fluid flow can result in ?chaotic? trajectories; and that flows can enhance ? and sometimes inhibit -- the spreading of groups of swimming microbes and of reaction fronts. The results from these experiments could help explain how algae blooms form and how diseases spread in moving populations; an understanding of active mixing could also help in the development of ?self-assembled? microstructures.  All of the research is done with undergraduate students, giving them experiences that play an important role in their development as scientists.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The experiments in this project study the effects of laminar flows on active impurities that consume energy, resulting in motion relative to the fluid. The active impurities are (a) self-propelled microbes, such as swimming bacteria and algae; and (b) propagating chemical reaction fronts. The flows include vortex chain and vortex array flows, hyperbolic flows in a cross-channel, time-dependent channel flows, and spatially-disordered flows. Previous experiments by the PI?s group have demonstrated that ?burning invariant manifolds? and ?swimming invariant manifolds? block the motion of active impurities in laminar flows. We will extend these studies to explore transport and pattern formation of active impurities over distances larger than typical flow scales. The experiments will investigate: (1) the effects of laminar mixing on the growth of microbial colonies, both with and without chemo- and phototaxis; (2) the effects of chaotic fluid mixing on biofilm formation; (3) large-scale propagation of reaction fronts and the leading edges of microbial ensembles; (4) chaotic motion of active impurities in flows where passive mixing is non-chaotic; (5) long-range transport of active impurities in laminar flows; and (6) how selection over multiple generations enhances certain swimming protocols in response to the fluid mixing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main themes are (1) Systems of Polynomial Equations, (2) Computer Science and Computational Complexity. Systems of polynomial equations can be thought of as describing the dependence relations between physical quantities in some models. The solution set of them describes the geometric shape of the model. Natural phenomena, and hence the model describing them, often come equipped with a rich symmetry. Hence it is natural to use symmetry-based methods to study them. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of the geometry as well as the utility of the model. A second theme of the project is the complexity of matrix multiplication (a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers). Finding efficient ways to multiply matrices is the topic of a subfield of Computer Science known as complexity theory. In 1968, Strassen discovered that the widely used algorithm for matrix multiplication which was assumed to be the best possible, is in fact not optimal. Since then, there has been intense research in both determining just how efficiently matrices may be multiplied and determining the limits of how much Strassen's algorithm can be improved. The PI proposes to use modern mathematical techniques to tackle those problems. This project will have a substantial broader impact through the development of new software for the open-source computer algebra system Macaulay2, and through the PI?s interest in broadening participation in mathematical research.<br/><br/>The proposal involves several main themes: Weyman-Kempf geometric techniques, syzygies and minimal free resolutions, secant varieties and the study of tensor ranks. The first goal is to find new examples and analyze existing examples to extend Weyman-Kempf geometric techniques to study non-normal varieties. The second goal is the study of nilpotent orbit closures and determinantal thickenings. The PI will use technical tools such as spectral sequence and Lie superalgebra representations to compute numerical and homological invariants of related varieties.

Joint decomposition of these datasets, arranged as matrices or tensors, provides an attractive solution to data fusion by letting them fully interact and inform each other and yields factor matrices that are directly interpretable, where the resulting factors (components) are directly associated with quantities of interest. This research will provide a powerful solution for inference from large-scale data by effectively summarizing the heterogeneity in large datasets through the definition of homogeneous subspaces such that components within a subspace are highly dependent. The success of the methods will be demonstrated through identification of homogeneous subgroups of subjects from neuroimaging data, thus enabling personalized medicine whose goal is to tailor intervention strategies for a given individual. Effectively summarizing information in large-scale datasets is at the heart of many of today's challenging problems, hence the new set of tools will impact numerous areas in science and technology, including those in medical imaging, remote sensing, image/video processing, communications, and social networks. <br/><br/>Independent vector analysis (IVA) and coupled tensor factorizations are two powerful ways for working with spatio-temporal data, each exploiting the structural/dependence information through different mechanisms. They also provide strong uniqueness guarantees, which is key for interpretability. This project leverages the complementary strengths of IVA and coupled tensor decompositions to develop a powerful framework for joint analysis/fusion of a large number of datasets through automated identification of homogeneous subspaces along with the components within these subspaces. This is accomplished by initially developing effective solutions to the problem with IVA and with coupled tensor decompositions, working in parallel. Then, in a second stage, the connections between these two approaches are established, both in terms of methods and uniqueness conditions, to develop a methodology that leverages the strengths of both approaches. The emphasis on uniqueness and interpretability of the solutions together with an application to a challenging dataset will ensure that the methods, as well as the developed theoretical foundations, are not only complete but also practically useful. Another important aspect of the work is the establishing of bridges across two communities that do not necessarily communicate. The work will demonstrate that statistically and algebraically motivated approaches to data fusion are not in competition with each other but have important complementary aspects that can be effectively leveraged.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Gabrielle Sandstedt is ""Investigating the genetic and ecological basis of hybrid vigor in nature"". The host institution for the fellowship is Utah State University and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Catherine Rushworth and Emily Josephs.<br/> <br/>A critical concern for plant breeding is ensuring food security in a world impacted by climate change. One approach to this problem is breeding genetically divergent plants to create hybrids that outperform their parents in survival and reproduction, a phenomenon called hybrid vigor. While hybrid vigor has led to the formation of many hybrid crops, it is not understood how hybrids will respond to changing environments. This work utilizes Boechera, a wildflower system to deepen an understanding of the genetics and ecology of hybrid vigor in nature. Such knowledge can be implemented to secure the food supply. Additionally, this research will allow to promote equitable opportunities for students in academia by participating in programs that support undergraduates from diverse backgrounds, such as Utah State University's Native American Summer Mentorship Program. The research also presents valuable opportunities initiating public discussions on the role of research in developing crops that meet the needs of a growing population. The Fellow will coordinate these discussions and provide learning activities at the longstanding scientific lecture series Science Unwrapped, a science outreach program hosted by Utah State University.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to identify ecological variables and genetic mechanisms that facilitate hybrid vigor in nature. To pinpoint the effects of key environmental variables on hybrid vigor, parental lines and hybrid combinations of two Boechera species, along with wild-collected hybrids, will be planted in a manipulative field experiment and measured for fitness. The next objective uses genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data of natural hybrids and de novo crosses to determine the genetic mechanisms involved in hybrid vigor. This includes characterizing the distribution of genetic load within Boechera species, examining whether heterozygosity masking these alleles in hybrids predicts fitness across environments, and determining how differential gene expression underlying hybrid vigor phenotypes varies across environments. The research will generate extensive data, including seed collections, plant tissue samples, fitness and trait measurements (which will be submitted to https://datadryad.org), and several types of genomic sequence data (which will be made available on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). Together, these data will reveal ecological and genetic factors that contribute to hybrid vigor while providing substantial ecological and genetic resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator will also consider a wave model to study the time-evolution of the structure of defects that form in liquid crystals, which are materials used for example in display devices, where understanding and controlling the structure of defects has technological ramifications.

Both analytical and numerical techniques will be used to enhance the current understanding. The first goal of the project is to study the stability of solutions of the compressible Euler equations, which develop shock waves, and the existence of solutions with large total variation. A second goal is to study the singularity formation, global existence, and stability for solutions of Poiseuille flow of a nematic liquid crystal in a tube, via the wave-type Ericksen-Leslie model.

A major impediment to scaling up the output from wind energy generation is structural failure due to vibrations of turbine blades induced by unsteady wind loads and extreme weather conditions. Without effective means to guide or isolate vibrational energy in such structures, concerns about damage and safety enforce suboptimal designs and operation. To address this challenge, this project investigates a hitherto unexplored class of engineered materials, called moiré metastructures, that can guide and confine elastic wave energy in ways that are unattainable in conventional materials. An integrated set of education and outreach activities aims to positively impact engineering education and contribute to a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce. These include metastructure design challenges in an undergraduate course, hands-on activities at workshops for K-12 students, international student exchange with a research group in France, and participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in research.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop the foundations for the design of a class of bilayered architected plate metastructures, coupled by nonlinear between-layer springs, that allow independent engineering of dispersion and nonlinearity and, as a result, the possibility of uniquely nonlinear wave phenomena, such as solitons, frequency combs, wave bending, and unidirectional propagation. It achieves this aim by investigating how nontrivial topological properties of moiré metastructures, obtained by stacking two layers of hexagonal, square, and Kagome lattice-based plates, result in almost flat dispersion bands that can be exploited and combined with space-time modulation of stiffness to guide or confine wave energy. The approach relies on theoretical analysis of discrete spring-mass models, finite-element analysis using discontinuous Galerkin basis functions based on Bloch modes, design optimization and fabrication of coupling springs with the desired nonlinear stiffness, and experimental validation using laser-Doppler vibrometry and high-speed imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The observed increases in air temperatures and atmospheric moisture content over Greenland have significant implications for the region?s climate. These changes have altered the frequency, type, and total amount of precipitation falling on the Greenland Ice Sheet and increased the likelihood of extreme heatwaves and melt events that directly affect sea and land ice growth and loss rates in and around the region. Despite the notable warming and moistening atop Greenland, the driving mechanisms behind these recent trends are poorly understood. Research to date has been inconclusive on whether local oceanic and atmospheric processes, broader-scale mechanisms in the climate system, or a combination of these multiscale factors are attributable to sustaining the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with Greenland?s warming and moistening. A more complete understanding of these complex climate system interactions is essential to improving climate model physics and more accurately capturing Greenland?s ice sheet changes and resulting global impacts, like sea-level rise.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis for this project is that low frequency, high-latitude circulation variability is sensitive to multiple processes, including anthropogenic, remote, and local climate forcings. Through statistical and diagnostic analyses of historical, atmospheric data, and climate model experiments from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1 and 2 and model output from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the project will rigorously test this hypothesis while addressing several knowledge gaps in Greenland hydroclimate research guided by three main questions: 1) what natural climate and anthropogenic forcings associated with local ocean-atmosphere processes are the strongest controls of the Greenland region?s summer circulation variability and air temperature and moisture on interannual-to-interdecadal time scales?; 2) how do large-scale circulation variability and associated processes regulate weather-to-seasonal mean time scale moisture over the Greenland region?; and 3) how reliable are CESM2 and CMIP6 models in replicating observed circulation changes over Greenland and associated impacts on temperature and moisture? Project outcomes will be shared with the scientific community and the public through development of near-real time online visualizations of moisture processes across Greenland and the organization of a working group or hybrid workshop on atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere interactions around Greenland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since systems often demonstrate chaotic behavior, it is natural to study them through the lens of their underlying geometric structure and dynamical invariants.  By studying flexibility and rigidity phenomena in dynamics, the PI will investigate various relationships between these invariants and structural properties, thereby revealing new features of smooth dynamical systems and the geometry of manifolds.  Thus, structural aspects of dynamical systems will be clarified with the goal of making the tools of dynamics more readily applicable in other areas of mathematics, as well as other scientific fields.  As part of the proposed project, the PI aims to involve undergraduate and graduate students in exploring the behavior of some low-dimensional systems with computer experiments in the context of flexibility and rigidity.<br/><br/>The main goals of the project split into two distinct directions.

Concurrently, the PI will determine the natural restrictions on those invariants in a fixed class and search for relations that imply new instances of dynamical and/or geometric rigidity.

Many self-assembly processes in biology are ?self-limited?, meaning that assembly automatically stops at a particular size and structure. These self-limited assemblies perform important functions in biological cells, and thus understanding how they work would advance our understanding of life and diseases. Moreover, learning to design self-limited assembly processes in synthetic systems could enable important technological applications. However, the achievable sizes and yields of assembled structures are currently much smaller than those of natural systems. This limitation arises because the field lacks theoretical principles to guide designing the subunits and reaction conditions to ensure robust, efficient assembly. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop such theoretical principles, by using computation and theory to understand mechanisms that biology uses make self-limited assembly efficient, and to learn how to apply them to synthetic assemblies. The project will undertake three thrusts, each of which investigates a different mechanism. The first thrust will study how using multiple species of subunits with different interactions can increase achievable assembly sizes and yield. The second thrust will investigate how varying reaction conditions in time can increase assembly rates and yields. The investigators will combine new computational methods with a theoretical framework called optimal control theory to develop efficient algorithms to determine time-sequences of reaction conditions that maximize yields. The third thrust will study self-assembly within phase-separated droplets. Liquid-liquid phase separation refers to the de-mixing of a solution into droplets with different chemical compositions, such as when oil and water separate. During some virus infections, the virus remodels its host cell to form phase-separated droplets within which new viral particles assemble. This project will study how assembly rates and yields depend on properties of the phase-separated droplets, such as their size and the tendency of subunits to locally concentrate inside of the droplets. Results from each thrust will be tested against experiments performed by collaborators, in which DNA origami or protein design is used to create subunits that assemble into symmetric shells, helical tubules, and other structures.<br/><br/>The research will provide interdisciplinary science technology engineering and mathematical (STEM) training for undergraduate and graduate students, at the interface between physics and biology. The research program is designed to recruit diverse students, and train them in computational research as well as effective scientific communication to expert and non-expert audiences. The project will also include programs in which the researchers describe their results to the public. These efforts will include a program integrated in the physics curriculum of a local high school, in which students engage in a hands-on activity that explains the physics and geometry of self-assembly in viruses and technology, while conveying the wonder, excitement, and impact on society of scientific research.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The self-limited assembly of protein subunits into finite-sized structures with well-defined architectures is a hallmark of life. Such structures abound in nature, where they perform essential functions of cells and the pathogens that infect them. Recently, advances in DNA origami and protein design have enabled engineering synthetic subunits that are programmed for self-limited assembly, with atomic-scale precision rivaling that of natural proteins. Yet, achievable sizes and yields of assembled structures fall far short of nature, due to a lack of theoretical principles to guide designing subunits and reaction conditions for robust, efficient assembly. This project aims to overcome this limitation, by using computation to understand mechanisms that biology uses to circumvent constraints on assembly timescales: tunable ?subunit complexity?, by having multiple subunit species with specific interactions, and nonequilibrium spatiotemporally varying assembly driving forces. The project will undertake three complementary thrusts. Thrust 1 investigates how self-limited assembly depends on subunit complexity, to identify general strategies to increase yields. Thrust 2 combines Markov state models with optimal control theory to develop efficient algorithms for optimizing time-dependent assembly protocols. Thrust 3 will use simulations to understand how self-assembly is affected by a prominent form of spatial control in cells ? liquid-liquid phase separation. The research will investigate how liquid-liquid phase separation can accelerate assembly and enhance robustness against parameter variations. Results from each thrust will be tested against experiments performed by collaborators, in which DNA origami or protein design is used to create subunits that assemble into icosahedral capsids, helical tubules, and other structures. <br/><br/>Assembling large target structures is challenging because assembly rates are constrained by competing thermodynamic and kinetic effects. The scientific community lacks strategies to engineer assembly reactions that simultaneously satisfy these trade-offs, due to crucial gaps in self-assembly theory: (1) Previous models have focused on minimal subunit complexity (assembly from one subunit species) or maximal complexity (addressable assembly, in which each subunit is unique); (2) Optimizing time-dependent assembly protocols for three-dimensional systems has been computationally intractable for most systems; (3) Despite intensive research on liquid-liquid phase separation, its effect on self-assembly has received relatively little attention. This project aims to develop computational models and tools that overcome these limitations. Thrust 1 will provide the first systematic study across the full range of subunit complexity, to identify optimal levels of complexity and the effects of geometric frustration or redundant interactions that arise at low or high complexity. Thrust 2 will leverage the properties of Markov state models to develop a highly efficient optimization framework that is applicable to diverse self-assembly systems. The investigators will use this framework to determine optimal time-dependent protocols for three-dimensional self-limited assembly. Thrust 3 will provide the first models for self-limited assembly coupled to liquid-liquid phase separation. <br/><br/>By establishing design principles for engineering subunits that can be preprogrammed to assemble into arbitrary three-dimensional structures, this research will pave the way to highly scalable manufacturing of nanostructured materials for biomedical and technological applications. The results also make a key step toward a theory of living matter, by elucidating self-assembly mechanisms that underlie essential functions in biological cells and pathogens. The computational algorithms developed for this research will be broadly applicable to self-assembly. <br/><br/>The research will provide interdisciplinary STEM training for undergraduate and graduate students, at the interface between soft matter physics and cell biology. The research program will recruit diverse students, and train them in computational research as well as effective scientific communication to expert and non-expert audiences. Public outreach will include a program integrated in the physics curriculum of a local high school, in which students engage in a hands-on activity that explains the physics and geometry of self-assembly in viruses and technology, while conveying the wonder, excitement, and impact on society of scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the significance of ROMP in producing a plethora of functional polymers, existing techniques still cannot completely prevent chain transfer and termination, in particular when low-strain monomers are involved.  As a result, mixtures of linear and cyclic macromolecules of different sizes are formed that are difficult to separate.  This research endeavors to directly address this unmet challenge and introduce a distinct strategy for processive ROMP.  In this strategy, polymerization catalysts will be encapsulated in molecularly defined cage structures, such that, ideally only monomers, but not nascent polymers, can access the catalyst.  This will thereby inhibit the chain transfer and termination caused by the interaction between the catalyst and the nascent polymer, resulting in linear macromolecules with controlled molecular weights.  The developed methodology will also be applied to ROMP of sustainability-oriented monomers that are considered challenging for ROMP due to their low strain. These monomers include cyclic alkenes with low ceiling temperatures and those consisting of degradable functionalities.  This research will provide interdisciplinary training for students in polymer synthesis and sustainability.  The collaborative team will additionally develop a hybrid three-week summer workshop aimed to introduce polymer chemistry principles and practices into 3D-printing. The workshop will be integrated with existing outreach programs to stimulate interest in polymer science and catalysis among college and high school students in the communities served by Boston College and Iowa State University.<br/><br/>Synthetic polymers ranging from commodity products to specialty goods are at the center of modern society. Among many properties, molecular weight, sequence, and dispersity are essential in determining the material performance of polymers. Therefore, the precise control over these properties is the central goal in modern synthetic polymer chemistry.  This research will focus on developing processive ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of low-strain cyclic alkenes through confining organometallic ruthenium catalysts into molecularly defined cages.  Such an approach is expected to allow access to monomer molecules but prevent the nascent polymer chains from accessing these confined catalysts.  As a result, well-defined, high, and ultra-high molecular weight, low dispersity polymers from ROMP could be realized.  The first objective will focus on design of homogeneous and heterogeneous Zr-based cages using the reversable aperture opening/closing approach.  These cages will then be utilized to encapsulate ruthenium-based Grubbs and Hoveyda-Grubbs ROMP catalysts.  The second objective will leverage molecularly confined catalysts to enable polymerization of sustainability-oriented monomers containing degradable functionalities.  Lastly, kinetic behaviors of ROMP mediated by molecularly confined catalysts will be systematically investigated. The basic guiding principles associated with this project are general and have the potential to be applied to various other catalyst-mediated chain-growth polymerization techniques in which the control of termination and/or chain-transfer events is desirable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-fertilization is associated with a common set of changes in floral development, together known as the selfing syndrome. For example, flowers of self-fertilizing species tend to be smaller and unscented because they do not need to attract pollinators. We know less about how the transition to self-fertilization impacts the genome and epigenome ? the pattern of chemical modifications that control the way genes function. Using multiple plant species in two genera (Capsella and Mimulus), this research will investigate how genomes and epigenomes differ between self-fertilizing and outcrossing species. This work will help us understand hybridization barriers, which limit our ability to make inter-species crosses for breeding improved crops. This research will also increase our fundamental understanding of seed development, a critical aspect of agricultural productivity, and generate a wealth of sequence-based resources that will enable the plant genomics community to answer further questions. Research from this project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the PIs. Finally, this research will help maintain ongoing collaborations with local K-12 teachers to develop hands-on plant biology activities for use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>Selfing fundamentally alters the nature of genomic conflicts and is predicted to affect several epigenetic phenomena, including genomic imprinting, effective ploidy, and host defense against transposons. RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) plays a key role in epigenomic regulation and has been linked to genomic conflicts, suggesting that the nature or function of RdDM might be altered following the evolution of selfing. This project will test the hypothesis that there is a common pattern of epigenomic change following the transition to inbreeding and that these changes are mediated by RdDM. Because the selfing syndrome is only apparent when multiple transitions to selfing are compared, the relationship between mating system and the epigenome will be investigated using six inbreeder/outbreeder comparisons in two genera (Capsella and Mimulus). Specific areas of research include 1) determining how selfing impacts RdDM?s role in transposon defense and collateral gene silencing, 2) establishing the molecular cause of divergence in effective ploidy and determine whether these changes are common during the transition to selfing, 3) assessing the differential function of RdDM following the evolution of selfing, and 4) determining whether there is a reduced role for RdDM in selfing species.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent gene editing tools enable this in principle, but their potential for crop improvement is limited by the lack of understanding of how mutations map to phenotypic outcomes of interest, including increased photosynthetic capacity, drought resistance, or nitrogen-use efficiency. Importantly, tuning the expression of particular target genes can improve such traits, suggesting that understanding and finding genomic mutations that enable rational tuning of protein abundances could be sufficient for crop improvement. Overall, this project develops the missing tools to understand regulatory mutations in plants and could help usher in a new era in which gene editing technology ? in contrast to slow and manual breeding efforts ? could enable the rapid creation of novel crop varieties addressing fundamental food security and sustainability issues for society at large. The training objectives for the Fellow include not just further developing technical, analytical, and synthesis skills, but also communication and teaching skills. The Fellow currently does and will continue to convey the excitement and usefulness of scientific inquiry by participating in volunteering opportunities at Mount Tamalpais College, an organization that provides access to affordable higher education to students incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison.<br/><br/>In this project, a computational pipeline, coupled with high-throughput perturbative experimental assays, will be developed to overcome the inherently slow and low-throughput nature of understanding gene regulatory variants in plants. By focusing on validated sets of genes, the resulting understanding of regulatory mutations could enable simultaneous tuning of multiple target gene abundances with gene editing enzymes, and, since many known target genes participate in orthogonal pathways, could enable additive or synergistic increases in desired traits, as well as an improvement towards multiple traits, in a single step. Findings resulting from this work will be shared through publications, with any generated raw data, and analysis pipelines made available to the general public (through the sequence read archive and GitHub: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra, www.github.com) for reproducibility and as tools. All created materials will be made available upon request. In this way, everyone will have access to any resources generated from this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While symplectic manifolds have no local invariants, they do have interesting global ones. A major part of this project is concerned with ?Gromov-Witten? invariants, which aim to probe a symplectic manifold by studying maps from two-dimensional surfaces into the manifold that satisfy an appropriate partial differential equation. These invariants are very powerful, but it can be quite difficult to get good control over them because of their non-local nature. One key goal of the project is to prove new fundamental facts about Gromov-Witten invariants on certain symplectic manifolds that are defined by polynomial equations. The general strategy the PI will use is to ?cut open? the manifold along a divisor. The corresponding invariants of the divisor complement turn out to be very tractable and also provide a stepping stone towards understanding the Gromov-Witten invariants of the original space. The PI will continue to serve as a mentor to high school students at MIT's Research Science Institute, and will organize a workshop on homological mirror symmetry for graduate students. He will also continue to work on developing a Master?s program in mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Boston. <br/><br/>Specifically, in the main strand of the project, the PI will prove that the quantum connection on a Fano manifold with a smooth anti-canonical divisor has a singularity of unramified exponential type. The strategy is to view the quantum cohomology of the Fano manifold as a deformation of the symplectic cohomology of  the complement of the divisor. The symplectic cohomology of the complement can in turn be studied via the wrapped Fukaya category, allowing one to bring tools from noncommutative geometry to bear.  In a different direction, the PI will build on his previous work to relate the symplectic cohomology of an affine log Calabi-Yau variety to certain intrinsic mirror algebras recently constructed by algebraic geometers. The PI will then go on to study homological mirror symmetry for intrinsic mirror pairs using a combination of symplectic and categorical techniques also developed in previous work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Culture has important implications for a wide variety of outcomes, including governance, human capital investment, and the scope and extent of cooperation. Economists have sought to understand the drivers of variation in culture, and the consequences of various cultural practices for key economic outcomes. The theme of this CAREER project is that insights from anthropology, culture, and local context can help explain differences in development policy success across countries and if appropriately used, may improve the design and effectiveness of development policies.  The first project studies how to improve accountability and performance of local leaders; the second studies how a mismatch between indigenous institutions and development initiatives hinders the success of such initiatives, while the third project studies how social structures affect insurance and cooperation. The final project digitizes a new, large, and innovative ethnographic data for many developing countries that will be one of the few data sets of its kind.  The results of this project will improve the efficiency of development policies, hence reduce poverty around the world.  In addition, the results will help improve the effectiveness of US foreign aid programs, hence help the US maintain its global leadership in poverty reduction.<br/><br/>The research consists of four projects to study how culture interacts with policy to explain the heterogeneity in development outcomes across countries as well as contribute to the literature in evolutionary anthropology. The projects combine a variety of methods: randomized controlled trials, lab-in-the-field experiments, original surveys, and digitization of archival and ethnographic data. The first project uses RCT to investigate whether social structures that increase accountability of local leaders can be leveraged to improve the provision of public goods. The second project provides new evidence on the ecological origins of private, relative to communal, land rights and explores how traditional property rights structures affect efforts to title land. The third project studies how matrilineal kinship systems affect cooperation and insurance in the extended family, expanding the traditional focus within economics on the nuclear family to extended kinship. The fourth project is an innovative data digitization effort to provide access to new ethnographic data for several developing countries. The results of these projects will provide insight into how culture affects the efficacy of development policy, and how greater understanding of local context can improve development initiatives.  Besides improving development policy outcomes, the results will also help improve the effectiveness of US foreign aid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2023 IEEE SecDev Conference aims to continue its mission of providing a forum where researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers can meet to discuss ideas that focus on building-in security into our systems. The support for the conference is important for educating and training the workforce in this area and helping provide a pathway to research careers. The technical advances presented by the conference are critical to the development of secure software, which is important to society.<br/><br/>SecDev encourages students to consider big ideas that lead to a stimulating, thoughtful, and perhaps (gently) provocative discussion. This project sponsors travel expenses for students to attend the conference. Participation in the conference provides students with opportunities to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field, consequently exerting a positive impact on the quality of their research. The training and development of students in this way also help widen the talent pool of professionals and researchers focused on addressing the challenges of developing critical secure systems and services, leading to potential new areas of inquiry in this domain.

The team is interested in the oxygen content of magma as it ascends, and they will use the most common rock-forming mineral in the Earth?s crust, feldspar, to study that . This oxidation state of a magma is important because it plays a large role in regulating the style of the eruption and how explosive it is. The project will apply a new analytical technique to volcanic products from Mounts Shasta and St. Helens to gain a more thorough understanding of how their magmas have changed as they ascend to the surface before eruption. This work could lead to better indices of hazard assessment in active volcanic systems. This project supports a postdoctoral researcher who will build their expertise in spectroscopic measurements and gain experience in project leadership. It will also provide undergraduates valuable experience with laboratory research in the geosciences. Both PIs have dedicated much of their careers to encouraging and working with students from underrepresented groups in the STEM fields to grow diversity of scientific thoughts and backgrounds and opportunities for all.<br/><br/>The project will enable in situ measurements of feldspar chemistry and fO2, using a large diverse calibration suite of >180 samples. It will then use the resultant XAS calibrations to examine partitioning of Fe3+ and variations in fO2 in three natural systems: the Bushveld complex, Mount Shasta, and Mount St. Helens. It will result in new geochemical calibrations available to the geologic community and new insights into the role played by feldspar in partitioning cations with coexisting melts. Specifically, this project includes tasks that will enable Fe valence state and fO2 to be evaluated directly from feldspar single crystals using XAS, and will be complemented by other types of spectroscopic measurements: 1) Grow liquidus feldspars over a range of bulk compositions, fO2, and temperature to be used as standards for an XAS fO2 calibration; 2) Create a feldspar calibration for microanalysis of Fe3+ in feldspar using polarized, high-resolution XAS measurements of independently constrained standards using the pre-edge and main-edge regions of oriented single crystals; 3) Use the equilibrated feldspars with known fO2 to create a feldspar calibration for fO2 using polarized, high-resolution XAS; 4) Test and apply our feldspar calibration for fO2 on Bushveld, Shasta, and Mount St. Helens samples; 5) With undergraduate researchers leading the work, characterize the same suite of samples assembled for the oxybarometers using Raman, Mössbauer, ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and reflectance FTIR spectroscopies, looking for linkages between composition and spectral response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cloud data storage offers global access to digital information and allows portable devices to generate and interface with data that need not be stored locally; however, the negative impacts of Cloud storage facilities include energy inefficiency, land use allocation, and resource management. While global information sharing is an appropriate use of Cloud storage strategies, compensating for limited local storage capacity is, fundamentally, a challenge that can be addressed by increasing the storage density of data storage materials. With this LEAPS-MPS award, the research team investigates a new class of carbon-based molecular materials for non-volatile digital information storage with the potential to decrease the size of a bit of data by several orders of magnitude relative to traditional ferroelectric technologies and an order of magnitude relative to leading memory capacitor technologies. Ferroelectricity is a phenomenon by which information can be stored within the electronic polarization vector of a material. The potential use of this use of these materials would enable a technology that works by encoding information into the three-dimensional shape of a single molecule that can be modified with the application of an electric field. As part of this LEAPS-MPS project, undergraduate students at Amherst College learn advanced materials synthesis and engineering strategies. Additionally, this research encourages discussion of the sustainability, equity, and accessibility of local and remote data storage structures and inspires a reimagining of how these issues may be addressed.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The investigation of organic materials for practical information storage applications has long been precluded by the lack of organic ferroelectric systems that operate at or near room temperature. Ferroelectricity in organic crystals generally arises from collective rotation and/or displacement of molecules in the solid-state in response to an applied electric field. However, such mechanisms are sensitive to the details of crystal packing, which cannot yet be reliably predicted in silico. This project, supported by a LEAPS-MPS award, seeks to develop fundamental mechanistic insight for a new class of organic ferroelectrics that take advantage of the conformational inversion of bowl-shaped heteroatom-centered triangulene compounds (heterotriangulenes) for ferroelectric switching. Researchers investigate whether ferroelectric switching in the solid state is strongly correlated with the energetics of molecular conformational inversion rather than unpredictable subtleties of crystal packing, and subsequently study the tunability of ferroelectric performance through molecular design principles. The results of this research establish the foundation for a new class of ferroelectrics with the potential to approach the single-molecule limit for data storage. This research is conducted by a diverse and cross-disciplinary team of undergraduate researchers who receive training in organic and materials syntheses, X-ray crystallography, and device fabrication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon activation these catalysts are capable of promoting a number of chemical reactions. In contrast to this work, most visible light-activated reactions require catalysts that contain precious metals or halogen atoms and therefore are not considered to be environmentally sustainable. With a focus on overcoming this limitation, the collaborative Mani/Esipova team is employing computational modeling to design and optimize their catalysts and will subsequently test them in light-driven transformations. In addition to all of this, this research program is providing valuable opportunities for students. Undergraduate and graduate students that are involved in this work, including students who have been historically underrepresented in the sciences, are developing intellectually while building skill sets that lie at the intersection of synthetic organic chemistry and physical chemistry. Such training is valuable for their future careers, be it in academia or industry.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop a new family of organic heavy atom?free photoredox catalysts that contain a general motif that consists of orthogonal electron donor-acceptor aromatic chromophores. Generally speaking, photocatalysts absorb light and create electronically excited states that facilitate electron transfer reactions in a mild and controlled manner; as a result, they can produce highly reactive intermediates that lead to value-added bond-forming events. Most currently utilized photoredox catalysts employ halogens or precious metals to enhance the production of these excited states. The photoredox catalysts that are developed in this study not only take advantage of an underexplored photophysical phenomenon to produce excited states in pi-conjugated organic molecules, but they avoid the use of heavy atoms including metals and halogens. The research is demonstrating the unique properties and versatility of this new class of organic photoredox catalysts. This research is expected to establish structure-function correlations of donor-acceptor molecules in terms of the efficiency of the generation of the excited state and the associated catalytic activity. This work and the continued development of sustainable catalysts is providing a firm foundation for the continued exploration and the development of organic photoredox catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core of the infrastructure is a highly scalable syntactic differencing algorithm that models a programmer?s viewpoint of software change.  The infrastructure also supports querying and exploration of changes and is used to determine which programming language syntactic structures change between two source code versions.  Current differencing approaches have no understanding of the syntax of the programming language being used.  Thus, srcDiff produces a more accurate and human-understandable difference of changes.  The approach is very scalable and can be applied to large software systems.<br/><br/>Accurately analyzing changes to software is vital for studying how large critical software systems evolve.  srcDiff provides a means to produce accurate differences in an efficient and scalable manner.  The proposed infrastructure will greatly reduce the burden researchers and practitioners incur in obtaining, analyzing, and processing software changes.  Changes to software are used directly or indirectly for a wide variety of tasks including software merging, clone detection, author attribution, bug localization, feature location, recommender systems, commit classification, and much more.  Several tools for differencing exist, but there is no other syntactic differencing approach for source code that is accurate, scalable, lossless, and supports analysis of the results.  Currently, no usable syntactic differencing infrastructure is widely available to researchers or practitioners.<br/><br/>Change is an integral part of software development.  Knowledge about changes is required for the day-to-day activities of software developers.  srcDiff will reduce the cost to perform various types of research and enable a platform for the development of various types of tools to directly aid software developers.  As part of their daily development tasks, developers need to inspect recent and past changes, perform code reviews, merge branches, and debug software.  Software project managers need to make informed decisions that require knowledge of changes to their systems, such as change impact analysis.  The proposed infrastructure has the potential to positively impact and improve the quality of all types of software.  The srcDiff infrastructure appeals to a variety of stakeholders, including researchers, students, and software practitioners.<br/><br/>The srcDiff project website is at www.srcDiff.org.

Success in algebra is an important determinant of life outcomes, from high school graduation to college access and career and economic prospects. Unfortunately, a broad swath of research has documented the struggles students face learning algebra. Findings from both psychology and mathematics education research suggest that enhancing students? fraction learning may be one route to improving algebra learning. Researchers from both fields have found that fractions and algebra competence are closely related, but the basis of this relationship remains unclear. This project will design measures that efficiently capture the breadth and depth of students? fractions and algebra knowledge and investigate relations between fractions and algebra knowledge over a three-year period, from grades 7 to 9. By investigating how students? understanding develops over time, this study will identify critical time points at which instruction might prove especially fruitful.<br/><br/>The project will take place in two phases. Phase 1 is a measurement project in which participants in grades 7-9 will engage in within-subjects assessments of algebra knowledge and fractions knowledge using assessments adapted from prior research. A subset of students will also be interviewed to gain greater insight into their problem-solving approaches. Key covariates, including children?s mathematics anxiety, whole number skills, and general cognitive skills, will be measured in order to isolate the relations between fractions and algebra knowledge. This allows for empirical examination of the factor structure of the fractions and algebra domains and for development of efficient instruments with optimal coverage of the constructs. Phase 2 will use the refined measures to follow a new sample of children longitudinally over three school years (grades 7?9). Cross-lagged panel models will be used to simultaneously examine effects of fractions knowledge on algebra knowledge and vice versa, while also considering the role of covariates. Results will yield information about the developmental relations between fractions and algebra knowledge. Data will be collected online in both phases.<br/><br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

Among these two, explanation is the most critical to achieve global impact. Identifying the cause of natural phenomena not only enables us to predict their future occurrences, but also implies the means in which we may prevent or treat such events (e.g., the effect of genetic mutations on development of cancer). This is particularly true in the medical domain, where erroneous treatments can result in catastrophic consequences. Indeed, the medical domain mainly focuses on identifying correlations rather than causation. Such root-cause analysis and causality-based predictive modeling are critically needed for more accurate diagnosis and the timely selection of an appropriate type of therapy. The project's novelties and impact are designing techniques by combining automated formal reasoning and artificial intelligence (AI) to discover the causal relation between events to answer deep questions on real causes of certain medical conditions.<br/><br/>The project builds a prominent infrastructure for collecting preliminary data and designing proof of concept techniques that demonstrate the viability of this project?s approach based on formal reasoning and AI to extract causal structures in health and medical domains. The project first investigates two different notions of causality (Halpern-Pearl and Granger) and explores their fitness in the medical domain. Then, the project reduces the problem of extracting causal structures to decision procedures that solve certain problems on automated reasoning. To this end, the project utilizes off-the-shelf decision procedures for solving the satisfiability problem for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) and satisfiability modulo theory (SMT). In the probabilistic and predictive settings, the project incorporates model checkers for probabilistic systems to reason about models generated from medical data and Granger/probabilistic causality. Finally, in order to tackle the scalability issues in automated formal reasoning about causality, the project combines the developed techniques with AI, and augments AI with formal reasoning during the training phase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Social behaviors interact with multiple facets of an animal?s life, including space use, survival, and reproduction. In a world of accelerating change, it is critical to understand how social behaviors can help animals adapt to changing environments and when social behaviors restrict animals from adapting to new conditions. This project uses theoretical models and long-term observations from wild Asian elephant populations to ask 1) how genetic and environmental factors influence the structure of animal social systems and 2) how social systems change in response to habitat degradation and population turnover. The outcomes of this research inform conservation policy to protect endangered Asian elephant populations and mitigate human-elephant conflict across South and Southeast Asia. Additionally, teaching materials and outreach activities developed by the fellow for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students directly contribute to education and recruitment in STEM.<br/><br/>The fellow investigates factors altering social behavior using mathematical models and existing behavioral observations from three geographically and genetically isolated island populations of Asian elephant, encompassing the three sister species: Sri Lankan, Sumatran, and Bornean Asian elephants. The project develops theoretical models to assess the role of genetic and environmental factors on social phenotypes using multiagent simulations and social network analysis. Models are used to predict social dynamics and population persistence under different land use scenarios and variable turnover rates to provide informative projections for land use management. Training activities include gaining skills in 1) quantitative research methods from the research itself, 2) conservation policy and community engagement through collaborations with the UC San Diego School of Global Policy & Strategy and the non-profit organization Trunk & Leaves, and 3) teaching and mentorship through developing materials for a UC San Diego undergraduate field methods course, a graduate/young professionals workshop at the Society for Conservation Biology annual meeting, and outreach events for K-12 students in collaboration with the UC San Diego education programs, CREATE and Library NExT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to investigate what influential factors cause the climate to vary on decadal timescales, why and how?  The research will leverage existing Tree-ring data which are highly replicated, precisely dated, and available at global scale. As such, they constitute a major source of observations for assimilation in climate models. However, there are challenges for using tree rings as model data including (1) the seasonal nature of the response; (2) distinction of biological vs. climatic signals; and threshold responses in forests as climate sensors. In this project, the researchers propose to use deep machine learning to develop, validate and interpret new data models for tree rings (specifically, the width of tree rings) by assembling sufficiently large datasets for machine learning. This new methodological framework to interpret and assimilate tree-ring records in paleoclimate models has the potential for improving the reconstruction of climate fields over the common era which in turn could accelerate the detection and attribution of climate variability and change on timescales of years to decades. The project will build capacity for science by providing supervised research, education outreach and mentoring activities for a postdoctoral research scientist, and by supporting a significant undergraduate research experience. In partnership with NSF project (?Providing Early Access to Research & Learning in geoscienceS: PEARLS), this project will support efforts to diversify the geosciences. One open virtual workshop will be organized to train and mentor early career researchers with the aim to establish deep learning framework for data modeling in paleoclimatology.<br/><br/>This project will use deep learning-based approach (DeepGreen) to develop, validate and interpret new data models for tree-ring width (TRW). The researchers will assemble sufficiently large datasets for machine learning by clustering TRW series with similar response characteristics into aggregates. Using pseudoproxy experiments, a minimum dataset size requirements and algorithms suitable for TRW modeling will be identified. Data models from the real-world TRW network will then be developed and their skill evaluated relative to that of existing linear statistical and nonlinear and multivariate process-based TRW models. By deriving and validating data models for tree-ring width from deep learning exercises, the research seeks to: (1) further understand the environmental information contained in extant TRW data; (2) identify structural and observational uncertainties in deepGreen and process or mimic models; (3) complement existing modeling efforts targeting the information content and observational uncertainty in extant TRW data; (4) support efforts to identify data models by machine learning for other paleoclimatic observations. Beyond the scope of the work, deepGreen data models may be used within existing data assimilation frameworks, to develop and evaluate new paleoclimate reconstructions.

Strong winds forced against terrain produce waves called atmospheric gravity waves, which can grow in amplitude as they propagate to higher altitudes, becoming unstable, breaking, and causing turbulence. Another source of turbulence is shear layers in the atmosphere, where one layer of air slides over another, resulting in Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities. Collectively, both play important roles in accurately representing the Antarctic climate in weather prediction models. Collecting new turbulence observations in these remote southern high latitudes will improve wind and temperature forecasts of the Antarctic climate. This project will observe gravity wave and shear-induced turbulence dynamics by deploying custom high-altitude balloon systems in coordination and collaboration with a powerful remote sensing radar and multiple long-duration balloons during an observational field campaign at the Japanese Antarctic Syowa station.<br/><br/>This research is motivated by the fact that the sources representing realistic multi-scale gravity wave (GW) drag, and Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) dynamics, along with their contributions to momentum and energy budgets due to turbulent transport/mixing, are largely missing in the current General Circulation Model (GCM) parameterization schemes, resulting in degraded synoptic-scale forecasts at southern high latitudes. This project utilizes high-resolution in-situ turbulence instruments to characterize the large-scale dynamics of 1) orographic GWs produced by katabatic forcing, 2) non-orographic GWs produced by low-pressure synoptic-scale events, and 3) KHI instabilities emerging in a wide range of scales and background environments in the coastal Antarctic region. The project will deploy dozens of low-cost balloon systems equipped with custom in-situ turbulence and radiosonde instruments at the Japanese Syowa station in Eastern Antarctica. Balloon payloads descend slowly from an apogee of 20 km to provide high- resolution, wake-free turbulence observations, with deployment guidance from the PANSY radar at Syowa, in coordination with the LODEWAVE long duration balloon experiment. The combination of in-situ and remote sensing turbulence observations will quantify the structure and dynamics of small-scale turbulent atmospheric processes associated with GWs and KHI, thought to be ubiquitous in polar environments but rarely observed. Momentum fluxes and turbulence dissipation rates measured over a wide range of scales and background environments will provide datasets to validate current GCM parameterizations for atmospheric GW drag and turbulence diffusion coefficients in the lower and middle atmospheres at southern high latitudes, increasing our understanding of these processes and their contribution to Antarctic circulation and climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet humans are remarkably able to filter out distractions in the face of some goal that they are trying to reach.  How is this accomplished?  The present research program is aimed at studying how salient distractions in the visual world hurt ongoing performance and how humans manage to mitigate these distractions in order to be productive.  Toward this end, the investigators have created a novel way of studying distraction. Participants search for a particular item among other distracting items while the moment-by-moment movement of their eyes is recorded. The task forces them to respond at varying times after the presentation of each visual array. The investigators can track where participants are looking and how distractions affect them at different times into the processing of each display.  Data will also be analyzed using a computational model that helps uncover how distractions impair performance.  <br/><br/>This research creates a model situation for the study of distraction in the visual world.  Participants see a series of geometric objects; their task is to move their eyes to the oddly shaped object in the display.  To distract them, an oddly colored object that is irrelevant to the task is sometimes presented.  A critical feature of the task is that it changes the time available to the participants to move their eyes with each display so that sometimes a response is required very quickly after a display is presented and sometimes participants have longer to process the visual information.   Performance is modeled theoretically as consisting of two mental processes: 1) a reflexive response to the distractor that has to be avoided and 2) a goal-oriented response to the oddly shaped object.

However, it is also a challenging subject for many students to learn. A key determinant of students' success in modern CS classrooms is whether and how they use self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, such as planning, goal setting, and adapting their learning strategies to meet new challenges. The aim of this project is to help develop theory to explain how students engage in self-regulation, specifically in CS classrooms, and how this impacts their learning outcomes. This CS-specific model of SRL is critical to help scientists develop effective interventions for improving student learning (e.g., teaching students how to set effective goals) because it will help computer science educators and researchers predict how students might respond to those interventions. To advance theory, this project will develop new methods for studying SRL in CS classrooms. Currently, one of the best ways to study SRL in detail is to have students think out loud as they work and learn, so scientists can understand what SRL skills and strategies students are using and why they are using them. However, this is a time-consuming process, and it is impractical to use in real classrooms. To address this challenge, this project will pair think-aloud data with the log data students produce when learning with technology, to verify how to use this log data as a measure of students? SRL. Being able to rely on these automatically logged data will allow scientists to study SRL in authentic CS classrooms, at scale, with large, diverse groups of learners. These studies may also help determine how SRL processes in CS courses are similar or distinct from those in other STEM courses. The results of this project will help CS education researchers to develop more effective learning interventions, especially for students who are underrepresented in CS.<br/><br/>This project will apply, test, and elaborate a model of self-regulated learning (SRL) in computer science (CS) education (i.e., SRCSL) by validating and analyzing fine-grained trace data from students' interactions with programming tools in authentic undergraduate classroom settings. SRL encompasses students' thoughtful pursuit of academic goals by planning, monitoring, controlling, and reflecting upon what and how they learn. These behaviors are a key determinant of students' success in many domains, including CS. Discipline-based models of SRL in CS are still nascent and largely untested in rigorous ways that reflect cutting-edge practices for data collection and validation that can scale to larger populations. The development of a SRCSL model requires large-scale collection of validated SRL traces from authentic CS classrooms. To do so, first the project will use laboratory studies to collect both digital trace data from programming tools and think-aloud protocol (TAP) data from students as they complete authentic learning activities, coding TAPs to identify SRL events. Researchers will align these two data sources, mapping digitally logged events to the verbal SRL events that they reflect, and then use the coded TAP data to validate inferences about what SRL processes the digital trace data indicate. Second, researchers will collect a large sample (N ? 2,000) of trace data from two CS courses and apply the validated mapping to identify SRL events, from digital trace data, as they occur in the classroom. This will afford analyses regarding the sequential, contingent, and dynamic nature of SRL, informing an empirically-supported initial model of SRCSL. The proposed model will also posit how SRL behaviors predict students' cognitive and non-cognitive course outcomes, how these relationships vary across course contexts, and how they are moderated by students' personal characteristics. This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

One major difficulty with these systems is that, since there is no friction, there is nothing in the model to smooth out and isolate fine structure.  Instead, the evolution of a Hamiltonian system is organized by geometric objects like equilibrium solutions, periodic orbits, and invariant tori. This research project provides new insights into the fine structure of Hamiltonian systems using a blend of computational and analytical tools.  Indeed, the project combines computational and analytical techniques in novel ways, providing both new techniques for proving mathematical theorems about the properties of the models, and new computational techniques for understanding their practical behavior.  These ideas are used to answer outstanding questions in Celestial Mechanics, and to explore the behavior of gravitating systems of particles at a finer resolution than ever before.  Explicit applications of this research include the design/discovery of new low energy transfer orbits for space flights in the solar system.<br/><br/>This project introduces new analytical and computational methods for studying phase space structure in nonlinear systems. Applications to Hamiltonian systems are stressed, as in this case there are no attractors to organize the dynamics. The project has two main parts. The first part is local and expands existing high order techniques for computing hyperbolic invariant objects to encompass the parabolic case. The second part is more global and develops computational methods for growing invariant manifold atlases comprised of high order chart maps for stable/unstable manifolds. An important application is the computation of intersections between such objects, and efficient search strategies are discussed. These intersections (or webs) play a critical role in organizing Hamiltonian systems as they determine transport between different regions of phase space and generate complicated recurrent dynamics.  The project involves graduate research activities and facilitates collaborations between researchers in the areas of resurgence theory and computational dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large fraction is for single-use applications. Consequently, more than 25 million metric tons of plastic are annually discarded into terrestrial environments. Bio-based plastics produced from readily renewable carbon sources (i.e., corn) are increasingly being used as substitutes for legacy plastics sourced from fossil fuels. Bio-based plastics are advantageous because their carbon is converted from atmospheric CO2 instead of petroleum. Furthermore, some of these plastics are designed to biodegrade in bioactive environments. All plastics are broken down in the environment by chemical and physical processes into smaller microplastics (less than 5 mm in size) that may become accessible to microorganisms and utilized for their life function or survival. The fate of microplastic residues depends on their degradation in the environment. This research tracks the degradation of microplastic particles of polylactic acid (PLA, a bio-based plastic) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, a petroleum-based plastic) in soils, where their slow decomposition can lead to plastic accumulation. The research exploits unique carbon isotopic ?tags? naturally inherent or artificially introduced to plastics to quantify decomposition with imaging and microbial community analysis to identify how degradation is occurring. The main goal of the work is to monitor the transferal of the isotopic tags to microbial biomass, and eventually, the carbon dioxide and/or methane gas microbes produce or ?exhale?. The research is important because it will expand society?s limited understanding of how plastics impact soil health and function, and natural earth processes (i.e., carbon cycling) given plastics? potential to alter the natural emission of climate warming gases like carbon dioxide and methane in soil systems. Bringing the science of microplastics to a diverse community is a priority of the research team. The project involves and supports secondary, undergraduate, and graduate level students that will be co-mentored by a multidisciplinary faculty team. Students will be involved in research objectives and trained in communicating science to the public. Importantly, students will gain experience across three increasingly related fields for solving the plastic pollution crisis: geochemistry, analytical chemistry, and polymer/green chemistry.<br/><br/>Microplastic decomposition occurs through synergistic abiotic weathering of the plastic and key enzymatic and/or microbial interactions. Due to their acclimation to anthropogenic waste, it is hypothesized that the soil microbiome will assimilate and mineralize microplastics, and that natural soil processes like physical mixing and chemical hydrolysis will promote the integration of soil plastics within aggregates and affect the overall assimilation and mineralization of soil organic carbon and plastics by the soil microbiome. The hypotheses will be tested in controlled soil microcosms by utilizing naturally abundant and isotopically labeled (synthesized) polymers that are experimentally degraded and exposed to soils and their native microbiome. Isotopic labels offer an approach to identify assimilation and/or mineralization since they will separate these and other competing processes and/or those that may be impractical to measure in a short period. The incorporation of the plastics? isotope label will be monitored via phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers and final mineralization gases (i.e., carbon dioxide and methane) using isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Spectroscopy based approaches (i.e., synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy) will account for the plastics? reactivity and association with soil aggregates. The combination of stable isotopic, spectral, and isotopic mass balance approaches will establish a fundamental understanding of plastic decomposition, and include a modeling of their assimilation and mineralization, transformation to lower weight products, and final conversion to carbon dioxide and methane in soils. This research will further basic science understanding of physical, chemical, and biological processes in soils and address a topic of great current practical interest in environmental geochemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alongside the advancement of knowledge, the project will contribute to broader societal benefits through the development of educational modules and course projects, research opportunities for undergraduate students, and outreach activities through the Michigan Tech Summer Youth Programs for students in grades 6-11.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop the foundations for a new energy transfer mechanism that leverages ambient vibrations to produce anechoic, directional traveling waves in a structural wave guide and propel fluid within the wave guide. To this end, the project seeks to determine whether anechoic structural waves can be generated from the stochastic vibration profile typical of a moving vehicle, as well as which critical parameters affect the induced fluid flow. Experimental and theoretical investigations will be carried out to identify the optimal nonclassical damping profile that needs to be added to a flexural beam to transform ambient vibrations into broadband steady-state propagating waves and induced fluid motion. Physics-based models will be developed to numerically study the dynamics of beams with multiple localized Kelvin-Voigt damping elements in air and when immersed in water. Experiments will be used to validate theoretical findings and explore features not available through the theoretical modeling, including boundary effects and other sources of damping.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. In our rapidly changing world, it is becoming more and more important to understand how and when species will be able to adapt to stressors. In particular, increasing and more variable temperatures are a major threat that impacts physiological performance and species distributions. We know that species may adapt genetically to these stresses over time, but they may also acclimate more rapidly through changes that do not involve genes within a generation or even across generations. Parsing apart when these various forms of adaptation and acclimation should be favored and what mechanisms may be employed are crucial to predicting how species should fare under climate change.<br/><br/>There is a large body of literature outlining under what environmental conditions we should expect plasticity versus genetic adaptation to be favored. However, less is known about what conditions favor different forms of plasticity (developmental, reversible acclimation, transgenerational) and how these various forms may interact to create optimal phenotypes. Using lab-reared populations of a common splash pool copepod that have been specifically selected to promote different patterns of plasticity, this project will be able to test theoretical predictions empirically and contribute to our understanding of how genomes interact with the environment to produce adaptive phenotypes. Additionally, there is a gap in knowledge surrounding the mechanisms behind these forms of plasticity. Epigenetic marks (i.e., DNA methylation) may be driving differences in gene expression that allow for species to adjust their phenotypes and physiology in response to stress. By combining an examination of the epigenetic signature of animals with known stress exposures and evolutionary histories (both lab-reared and wild populations) along with the extensive genomic and transcriptomic data from this study system, the fellow will examine the molecular mechanisms contributing to these broad-scale ecological and evolutionary patterns. Additionally, the fellow will strive to broaden participation in science by leading a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) and by participating in community outreach and engagement. The fellow will also engage in open and transparent science by sharing both results (sequences, data sets) and processes (code, pipelines) of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many existing sensing systems lack intelligence about the target and naively generate large-scale data, making communication and computation significantly costly. In many cases, however, the data generated by sensors only contain useful information for a small portion of the sensor activity. For example, machine learning algorithms continuously process the visual sensors used for environmental/security monitoring to detect sensitive activities. Still, these sensors only carry out useful information for a short time. On the other hand, biological sensors intelligently generate orders of magnitude less amount of data. This project develops machine learning algorithms that provide real-time feedback to sensors to ensure they only generate data needed for learning purposes. The approach is expected to provide up to four orders of magnitude data reduction from sensors. The results from this research will broadly impact many sensors used in internet-of-things applications, including infrastructure, mobile devices, autonomous systems, robotics, and healthcare. The project will also support underrepresented minority students through synergistic outreach plans and educational activities, including programs for K-12 students, undergraduate research opportunities, and new course development.<br/><br/>The research approaches introduced in this project aim to make fundamental changes to sensing systems in order to make future sensors intelligent for a wide range of cyber-physical applications. First, this project will develop novel brain-inspired learning algorithms that can provide fast and real-time feedback to the sensing module to intelligently control the rate of data generation from sensors. This feedback also makes sensors aware of the target task, enabling situational awareness. Second, the project will develop a novel framework that tightly integrates with a sensing circuit and brain-inspired algorithms to dynamically control the sensor functionality in a close-loop manner. The proposed hardware platform exploits the robustness of learning algorithms to design near-sensor computing platforms that are highly approximate, parallel, and efficient. Finally, this project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework on multiple large-scale systems.

The project is interdisciplinary in nature, spanning concepts in chemistry, physics, and materials science.  It integrates state-of-the-art design and synthesis of chiral macromolecular pi-systems with test structures to study their ability to act as filters and valves for spin transport.  The chirality of the macromolecular building blocks will be tuned and the resulting structures will be assembled on surfaces and in junctions. The macromolecules and their properties will be evaluated for quantum mechanical applications such as spintronics, spin-polarized light-emission, and spin-controlled catalysis.  In the course of conducting this research project, graduate students will be trained and prepared for future multidisciplinary science careers.  This will be complemented with a coordinated effort that spans curriculum development, mentoring of undergraduate students and outreach towards K-8 schools.

Fluids are all around us, and better understanding of fluid motion is of importance in science and engineering. The project aims to advance understanding of small-scale formation in fluid motion, a process that appears in a wide range of applications and is related to development of turbulence. The project will also focus on analysis of chemotaxis, directed motion of cells or other biological agents in response to external chemical stimuli. Here the main goal is to understand and quantify how chemotaxis helps facilitate many biological processes from reproduction to immune system function. Many chemotactic processes take place in fluid, and interaction between the fundamental effects of diffusion, fluid flow and chemotaxis will also be studied. These problems are at the forefront of modern applied analysis and will require development of novel techniques that should be applicable in other settings. The project will also involve the training of junior researchers at a postdoctoral and graduate level.<br/><br/>The first direction of the project is concerned with small scale formation and loss of regularity in patch solutions to the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation. The SQG equation appears in atmospheric science, where it is used to model large scale weather phenomena like temperature fronts. The PI and collaborators have recently discovered an intriguing structure in the evolution equation for curvature of the patch boundary, and plan to use this insight to obtain new results on ill-posedness and possible singularity formation in the bulk of the fluid. The second direction addresses small scale creation in solutions to the 2D Boussinesq system and 3D Euler equation. This direction also seeks to develop models suitable to gain insight into possible singularity formation in solutions of the 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in the bulk, suggested by recent numerical simulations of Tom Hou. The third direction focuses on the coupled Keller-Segel-fluid system and explores the potential singularity suppression by fluid advection. The project aims to establish first rigorous results of this sort in the situation where advection is not passive and is not in a perturbative regime. The final direction is concerned with the development of a new class of models addressing the effect of chemotaxis on biological reactions. The research is intended to go beyond regularity estimates and rigorously derive scaling laws that may be of interest in applications.

In the simplest problems, existing methods are prohibitively expensive and produce large errors that severely limit their usefulness in modern applications.

While geo-obfuscation offers strong privacy guarantees, the location errors that arise due to obfuscation can affect the quality of the service. Current research on this topic focuses on minimizing quality loss through optimization techniques, but due to the high computation overhead, it is limited to a small number of locations. Consequently, existing works restrict the scope of geo-obfuscation to either low granularity in a large-scale region or high granularity in a small-scale region, leaving little room for users to customize geo-obfuscation to their specific requirements. The project's novelties are to design a user-centric geo-obfuscation in multi-granularity and multi-scale, which can be customized based on users' diverse demands. The proposed research significantly enhances the flexibility and scalability of existing geo-obfuscation techniques, thereby advancing their application in various mobile contexts. The project's broader significance and importance are to positively impact the wide adoption of many advanced crowdsourcing applications while ensuring individual privacy. In addition, the educational efforts of this project encompass curriculum development, K-12 outreach activities, and the engagement of underrepresented students in research.<br/><br/>The project comprises three research tasks. Firstly, the project designs time-efficient algorithms capable of calculating geo-obfuscation for a wide range of location granularity and scales, covering millions of locations in a hierarchy that includes counties, cities, streets, buildings, and rooms.

Mass spectrometers measure mass-to-charge ratio of chemical species, a universal parameter that should make this analytical technique widely applicable across diverse fields. Currently, this capability is realized using different ion sources for different compounds. The goal of this research is to develop a single universal (panoptic) ion source that can analyze a wide range of chemical species. The idea of universality is expanded from the detection of diverse chemicals to include the analyses of liquid-, solid-, and vapor-phase samples, all using the same panoptic ion source. The subjects of chemical instrumentation, new ionization methods, and the processing of ultra-small sample volumes are well suited for the education of scientists at all levels. Education-outreach activities are fully integrated and are designed to directly impact students in the early stages (K-12) of their educational experience. Due to the simplicity of the proposed experiments, this group is well-positioned to introduce students ? particularly from groups underrepresented in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields ? to interdisciplinary science, build their confidence and encourage them to think of science in a broad, discovery-based manner. <br/><br/>Challenges associated with small volume analysis include inefficient fractionation prior to analysis, leading to significant matrix effects. The intellectual merits of this research revolve around the tandem development of three novel concepts. First, a dynamic electrospray process will enable temporally distinct ionization mechanisms to be initiated from a single emitter to ionize different compounds, as well as to offer temporal separation of chemical species involved, based on solution-phase mobility. Second, the plasma ionization included in the dynamic spray process will allow analysis of polar and nonpolar compounds in all three states of matter (i.e., liquid-, solid-, and vapor-phase samples), thus establishing the first panoptic (universal) ion source. Third, the specific mechanisms of ion generation (particularly those based on ambient plasma chemistry) will enable mass spectrometer operation in four conceivable modes (four quadrant) to detect all possible ion types (M?+, M?-, [M+H]+, [M-H]+, [M-H]-, [M+nH]n+) originating from the panoptic ion source. Therefore, a new panoptic mass spectrometry platform will be created in which the universal ion source will be coupled with a four-quadrant mass analyses. We expect this research to transform direct infusion mass spectrometry into a high-performance analytical system in which low-resolution mass spectrometers can be used more effectively for complex mixture analysis. This capability is made possible by enabling online sample processing, including temporal separation and chemical reactions. The specific reactions selected (e.g., charge inversion, transesterification, and epoxidation of C=C bonds) have potential to expand the scope of lipidomics by enabling lipid analysis at multiple isomer levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This definition might remind the reader of a commonly known puzzle called ?sudoku? which is a 9 by 9 Latin square with some additional constraints. The study of Latin squares dates back to the 1700s to the work of Euler. Latin squares have connections to various subfields in mathematics. For example, they are multiplication tables of quasigroups from algebra, they are used as error-correcting codes when one wishes to transmit data via a noisy channel such as power lines, etc. No matter how one fills a 3 by 3 Latin square, it is always possible to pick three cells, no two of which share a row, a column or a symbol. Such a collection of cells is called a transversal. In contrast, it is not possible to find a transversal in a two by two Latin square. A famous conjecture from the 1960s due to Ryser asserts that for odd n, it is always possible to find a transversal in an n by n Latin square. In the graph theoretic language, this is equivalent to the problem of finding a so-called rainbow matching in a properly edge-colored complete bipartite graph with partition sizes equal to n. This project aims to explore various problems which are related to finding certain rainbow structures in colored graphs. The current project, while combinatorially stated, has connections to other fields of mathematics, such as discrete  geometry and algebra, and solutions will likely involve some use of algebraic and probabilistic methods thus creating further connections between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project.<br/><br/>In this project we will explore questions related to the existence of various spanning and non-spanning colored structures in colored graphs. A rainbow subgraph of a colored graph is a subgraph in which each edge has a distinct color. We plan to work on questions that have two common themes at heart. The first one is understanding the structure and properties of an object, for example, a graph, given it does not contain some forbidden sub-object, for example, a rainbow subgraph.  These can be viewed as Turan-type problems adapted to the colored setting, where one wants to find, say the maximum number of edges in a properly edge-colored graph on a given number of vertices without containing a fixed rainbow subgraph.  The second type of problems we will study is to find out under what restrictions a colored graph has certain spanning or almost-spanning rainbow subgraphs, such as long or Hamiltonian paths, spanning or almost spanning trees, a perfect or almost perfect matching. The problems to study include but are not limited to the existence of large rainbow matchings in graphs, existence of large matchings in hypergraphs, the existence of rainbow bases for vector spaces and matroids, Turan-type problems and their rainbow analogues such as the appearance of a rational number as a Turan exponent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The host institution for the fellowship is North Carolina State University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Rosangela Sozzani. <br/><br/>Plant cells communicate with each other to coordinate growth, establish cell identity, and transmit stress responses through various signaling molecules and pathways. Plant intercellular communication is mediated by plasmodesmata, or gated channels in cell walls. Harnessing control over plasmodesmata formation, gating, and trafficking is key to regulating intercellular communication. Overall, this project will investigate how plasmodesmata form in cell walls and regulate intercellular molecular movement. In whole plants, it is challenging to study plasmodesmata due to their small size and the difficulty of creating mutant study systems. This project will address this challenge through the use of innovative 3D bioprinting technology to create plant single-cell systems, derived from soybean, to study cell walls as they form. This project will also investigate how either genome editing or compound treatments can control intercellular communication. As plasmodesmata are present across all plant species, they present a universal target for influencing cell communication under various abiotic or biotic stressors. To successfully complete these goals, the Fellow will continue her training in confocal microscopy techniques and gain expertise in single-cell genome editing as well as data and project management. This research will also provide opportunities for community outreach and participation of historically excluded scientists. To facilitate these opportunities, the Fellow will take mentorship and leadership training as well as lead workshops at the sponsor institution to introduce the importance of this work to the broader community.<br/><br/>To create the study system, soybean cells will be isolated by cell wall digestion and then bioprinted. Bioprinted cells will then be visualized using electron microscopy to detect plasmodesmata. To complement this technique, fluorescent probes and genome editing will be used to fluorescently label plasmodesmata to detect the dynamics of plasmodesmata biogenesis and localization in cells as they divide and reform cell walls. To quantify the dynamics of intercellular communication, fluorescent mobile probes will be applied to bioprinted cells and their flux rate will be measured to estimate the movement of both large and small molecules. Finally, to manipulate intercellular communication, a high throughput compound screen will be performed to quantify to what extent communication can be enhanced, inhibited, or decreased and whether these compounds have permanent effects. Overall, this will provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of cell communication and how extensively it can be controlled. Going forward, this will be useful in efforts to improve crop growth in areas such as inhibiting intercellular pathogen spread and improving aspects of plant development and environmental responses that are reliant on cell communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such integrals appear systematically in the context of harmonic analysis, a field of mathematics which studies properties of functions via their decomposition into components according to a suitable notion of vibrational frequency. The study of singular integrals is characterized by delicate cancellations which occur between positive and negative contributions. Some key questions to be considered in this project involve commutators. A commutator is the difference A*B-B*A of two products taken in the opposite order. The commutation property A*B = B*A is rare in general, and the size of the commutator gives a measure for the degree of non-commutativity. Classical examples are related to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The project will advance state of the art commutator theory involving singular integrals. This includes problems on curves with a geometric flavor and higher parameter variants of recent key estimates with applications to partial differential equations. Part of the project deals with an important singular integral, the Beurling?Ahlfors transform, and particularly with questions related to weighted estimates. Weighted estimates are generally desirable due to their wide use throughout harmonic analysis and its applications. Methodologically, discrete methods involving probability have recently become central in related problems, and such methods will be further developed in combination with new geometric constructions. In addition, the Principal Investigator will supervise graduate students on topics related to the proposed research, and will organize a research workshop for early-career researchers and a separate online conference for undergraduate research.<br/> <br/>This project revolves around the study of singular integrals, harmonic analysis, and commutators.

The relevant theory has recently been advanced by the discovery of counterexamples showing the failure of the famous A2 conjecture in this context, but the precise bounds are not completely understood. The investigator will also advance the theory of commutators by studying singular integrals on curves and bi-commutator analogues of recent commutator characterizations. Such commutator problems are also related to weak variants of sparse domination in the multi-parameter setting. Sparse domination methods have been central in the past decade for related problems but up to now have remained a one-parameter tool. On the methodological side, the project will further develop the method of approximate weak factorizations, which has been responsible for many recent breakthroughs, and will combine that method with other novel tools. The project will utilize dyadic-probabilistic analysis, fine-tuned counterexamples, and geometric factorizations to develop applicable harmonic analysis methods suitable for these and other questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plastic pollution has become a major environmental concern. In the aquatic environment, plastics can break down and form small fragments ranging from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers in size. These micro- and nano-plastic (MNP) particles offer a large surface area, which allows other organic contaminants dissolved in water, to interact with the MNP surfaces.  Understanding these binding interactions is important as they determine the fate and transport properties of both MNPs and organic pollutants. Moreover, elucidating the surface affinities of MNPs is critical in developing effective adsorption techniques to remove microplastics. In this project, surface interactions of different types of organic compounds with MNPs of various compositions and surface properties will be investigated. The project will not only generate new knowledge on the binding behavior of MNPs in the presence of organic molecules, but also train future scientists in tackling persistent challenges associated with plastics pollution.  <br/><br/>MNPs are heterogeneous and their interfacial chemistry is complex. Therefore, a systematic investigation using surface-selective second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance technology will be performed to determine the adsorption thermodynamic and kinetic parameters pertaining to various types of MNPs. The adsorption studies will be conducted using charged and neutral SHG probe molecules. Temperature-dependent adsorption studies are expected to reveal the binding strengths and mechanisms of their interaction with MNP/aqueous interfaces. Together, these experiments have the potential to help establish relationships between surface functional groups of MNPs and binding interactions. The role of non-specific vs. specific binding interactions will be examined. Additional objectives include investigating the impact of MNP ageing and of their size and shape on molecular binding. Determining a correlation between organic compound adsorption strength and chemical characteristics of MNPs has the potential, in the longer term, is expected to provide a foundation for improved modeling of the fate and transport of these emerging aquatic contaminants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses key questions in the region, including the location of the active plate margin, the composition of the rocks, the role do fluids sourced from great depth and high crustal temperatures in shaping earthquake and volcanic hazards in the area. The researchers will employ a geophysical tool, both on-land and within the Salton Sea, that is capable of recording tiny fluctuations in the Earth?s natural electromagnetic field and extract from these data estimates of subsurface electrical conductivities, i.e., how well the rocks and materials conduct electric currents. This information will then be translated to rock composition to depths greater than 100 km, fluid pathways and concentrations from these depths to mapped surface faults and volcanic targets, temperature variations, and fault dimensions and geometries, all with the aim of better defining the Salton Trough?s unique tectonic architecture. In addition to informing local seismic and volcanic hazards, broader impacts will include the education of two graduate students, a postdoctoral scholar, and local high schoolers during field campaigns as well as building connections between tectonic activity and the potential and prevalence of critical minerals (e.g., lithium) being explored in this area at present.<br/><br/>The Salton Trough is an exemplary case of the confluence of all three plate tectonic margin types, combining the southern San Andreas fault system (SSAF, transform) interrupted by localized incipient rifting (divergent) and abutted to the west by the Peninsular Ranges, a remnant of Farallon slab subduction (convergent). All these systems contribute to a region of complex structure and strain, rich in aqueous fluids and melts, and play key roles in the potential for destructive earthquakes along the critically strained SSAF and volcanic activity in the area. The research team will image and inform this tectonically complex region by deploying multi-scale (sites 100s m to 10s km apart) and amphibious (including the Salton Sea) magnetotelluric arrays and extracting electrical conductivity information from the surface into the uppermost asthenosphere. At the largest scale (>10 km) this information will address questions on variations in lithospheric-scale fabric, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and dehydration of the subducted Farallon slab. The focus of the mid-scale deployments will be crustal and uppermost mantle composition, the partitioning of fluids, partial melt, and by inference strain, and the evolution of these properties from transform to incipient rifting areas. At the finest scales (stations <1 km apart), the imaged conductivities will help highlight fault zone porosity, fluid content and attitudes and how these differ between creeping (e.g., SSAF) and locked fault strands. These multi-scale estimates, combined with existing geoscientific knowledge, will provide a more holistic understanding of local tectonics and its related geohazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-fertilization is associated with a common set of changes in floral development, together known as the selfing syndrome. For example, flowers of self-fertilizing species tend to be smaller and unscented because they do not need to attract pollinators. We know less about how the transition to self-fertilization impacts the genome and epigenome ? the pattern of chemical modifications that control the way genes function. Using multiple plant species in two genera (Capsella and Mimulus), this research will investigate how genomes and epigenomes differ between self-fertilizing and outcrossing species. This work will help us understand hybridization barriers, which limit our ability to make inter-species crosses for breeding improved crops. This research will also increase our fundamental understanding of seed development, a critical aspect of agricultural productivity, and generate a wealth of sequence-based resources that will enable the plant genomics community to answer further questions. Research from this project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses taught by the PIs. Finally, this research will help maintain ongoing collaborations with local K-12 teachers to develop hands-on plant biology activities for use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>Selfing fundamentally alters the nature of genomic conflicts and is predicted to affect several epigenetic phenomena, including genomic imprinting, effective ploidy, and host defense against transposons. RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) plays a key role in epigenomic regulation and has been linked to genomic conflicts, suggesting that the nature or function of RdDM might be altered following the evolution of selfing. This project will test the hypothesis that there is a common pattern of epigenomic change following the transition to inbreeding and that these changes are mediated by RdDM. Because the selfing syndrome is only apparent when multiple transitions to selfing are compared, the relationship between mating system and the epigenome will be investigated using six inbreeder/outbreeder comparisons in two genera (Capsella and Mimulus). Specific areas of research include 1) determining how selfing impacts RdDM?s role in transposon defense and collateral gene silencing, 2) establishing the molecular cause of divergence in effective ploidy and determine whether these changes are common during the transition to selfing, 3) assessing the differential function of RdDM following the evolution of selfing, and 4) determining whether there is a reduced role for RdDM in selfing species.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such FEMs possess several advantages over existing methods, including superior accuracy, robustness with respect to model parameters, and exact enforcement of multiple conservation laws. However, this class of FEMs is limited in their ability to handle various equation types and geometric domains. This research will overcome these limitations by developing new robust FEMs for incompressible fluid models that can be applied to a wider range of problems. It will focus on two main areas: improving existing FEMs for fluid flow on smooth domains and developing new FEMs for fluid flow on surfaces. The project will provide training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The research consists of two integrated components. The first focuses on developing structure-preserving FEMs for the Navier-Stokes equations on smooth domains. The investigator will use non-standard applications of divergence-conforming diffeomorphisms to construct robust schemes, with a focus on high-order schemes in two and three dimensions. The second component involves applying these structure-preserving schemes towards surface partial differential equation models of incompressible flow. The investigator will extend isoparametric schemes for smooth Euclidean domains to construct divergence-free surface FEMs based on standard nodal spaces that do not require extrinsic user-defined stabilization/penalization terms. Additionally, the investigator will extend the Finite Element Exterior Calculus framework to build discrete surface Stokes complexes with respect to approximate geometries, which will provide insight into the construction of robust FEMs based on the velocity-pressure formulation and lead to primal discretizations for the surface stream function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

No single species can simultaneously be best at everything it has to do to survive. Indeed, performing well at one facet of life often means doing poorer at another. One such trade-off is that species that are better at avoiding predators are often poorer competitors. Likewise, species that are strong competitors are often bad at avoiding predators. This trade-off helps maintain biodiversity in communities since it prevents any one species from dominating. However, competition and predation are sensitive to temperature and not all species may respond identically to warming. Consequently, the trade-off between competition and predator avoidance may change in a warming climate. Altering this trade-off may result in a loss of biodiversity and critical ecosystem services. This project will train future K-12 science educators in scientific inquiry. Additionally, the project will involve undergraduate students in research and will teach graduate students about modern research techniques. Together, the education and scientific training will provide opportunities for citizens to think critically about why biodiversity is being altered on our changing planet.<br/><br/>Many studies have shown that climate warming can change the number and type of species that live together in ecological communities. Yet, the mechanisms that lead to these changes in species coexistence are unclear. This research will use experiments on freshwater damselflies to develop a mechanistic understanding of how climate warming affects trade-offs between competition and predation. The project will use laboratory experiments to determine how competition and predation are affected by increased temperature. The experiments will be followed by a quantitative genetic study that will assess the genetic basis of the traits involved in the trade-off between competition and predation. Last, the project will use field experiments to test how warming affects species coexistence in large mesocosms. Trade-offs are a central principle in both community ecology and evolutionary biology. As such, the results will have implications for understanding how and why communities are structured and may change in the future. Further, the project will address how species have evolved to persist in communities. Collectively, the studies establish a comprehensive research program that builds a mechanistic foundation to connect the behavioral, physiological, and evolutionary processes that determine how climate warming will impact the ability of species to coexist.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Population and Community Ecology, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Evolutionary Processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vigorous efforts are now underway to design, build, retrofit, and operate a new generation of green buildings. The green building sector is one of the fastest-growing markets in the US. Recent work has shown that well-designed, intelligently controlled ?dynamic passive? systems, which use shading, natural ventilation, and night insulation to recruit climatic resources such as solar heat, cool air, and cold night skies, can reduce space heating and cooling loads extensively across US. These dynamic passive systems contribute to the urgently needed gas emission reduction effort and provide resilience to heatwaves and cold snaps.

This project will, therefore, develop the needed tools, by creating new marketable design software, design services, and system control hardware for dynamic passive systems.<br/><br/>The proposed project will address the complexity of dynamic passive systems design and control generated by the diversity of climatic resources, e.g., solar heat, cool air, and cold night skies, in different US regions.

They are particularly advantageous due to their simplicity and interpretability, making them well-suited for decision-making tasks, compared to complex neural networks that can be difficult to understand. However, despite their benefits, tree models are not immune to security and privacy concerns. Malicious actors can tamper with tree models or steal intellectual property, posing threats to the integrity and confidentiality of machine learning systems. Further, although there are studies of similar attacks on neural networks, differences between how neural networks and tree models work may affect how well those existing findings apply to tree models. Together, these issues mean there are a number of open questions around enhancing the security and trustworthiness of tree models. This project aims to develop novel strategies to address these questions and develop more robust and trustworthy AI-based systems, and develop both tools and educational opportunities through the work to make the findings widely available and impactful. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses the need for robust model authentication, watermarking for intellectual property tracing, machine unlearning for data privacy, and defense against backdoor attacks for tree models. The technical aims are organized around four tasks: a) Pursuing model identification by embedding unique signatures to generate differently embedded models; b) Developing novel methodologies of robust watermarking for tree models, for the purpose of tracing intellectual property; c) Designing novel algorithms for machine unlearning in tree models by exploiting tree reconstruction, residual-stable split, and combination of tree techniques; and d) Investigating the implications of backdoor attacks against tree models by leveraging the insights from the above tasks on tweaking tree models without significantly impacting the accuracy. These research efforts will contribute to the advancement of tree model security and trustworthiness, ensuring that these models can be reliably deployed in real-world applications while mitigating the risk of malicious attacks, unauthorized access, and privacy breaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particular target is the chemical bond between nitrogen and carbon atoms found in many high-value chemicals. Such light harvesting is currently achievable by nanometer-scale particles of coinage metals; however, the conversion of light to chemical energy is inefficient and uncontrolled. Professor Jain is addressing this challenge by using oxide minerals engineered on the nanometer scale to absorb visible light and produce energetic charges that survive long enough to be used productively for chemical energy generation. Furthermore, he is pairing these light-absorbing materials with chemical agents that direct and promote the flow of charge. If successful, the research will lead to technologies for manufacturing energetic reagents, fuels, and fine chemicals using renewable power and producing no carbon emissions. In public outreach activities, Professor Jain is also promoting sustainable technologies and practices through solar energy- and electricity-powered removal of nitrate pollutants from water sources near agriculture-dominated communities. The graduate students engaged in this project are gaining valuable experience in a wide range of chemical syntheses, spectroscopic and chemical kinetic analyses, and catalysis. This project is also providing opportunities for undergraduate researchers interested in sustainable technologies.<br/><br/>Plasmonic nanostructures allow the harvesting of light in the form of energetic charge carriers, which can in turn be deployed to accelerate or drive chemical reactions. However, harvesting of light and light-to-chemical energy conversion via this scheme remains well below the thermodynamic efficiency limit. Professor Jain is applying a newer class of plasmonic materials and hybridization strategies for maximizing the separation of photogenerated electron?hole pairs and utilizing them more efficiently and selectively for reactions such as nitrogen?carbon bond formation. Specifically, Professor Jain is employing plasmonic metal oxide nanostructures, which are anticipated to exhibit slower carrier relaxation and recombination. The other strategies involve the hybridization of plasmonic metal oxide nanostructures with polar surfaces, water-oxidation promoters, and homogeneous catalysts. The work is expected to elucidate physicochemical and materials design factors that govern carrier separation and extraction and illustrate chemical architectures and schemes that are ideally suited for the directed and efficient flow of carriers on the nanoscale.

Colón and his research group at SUNY Buffalo are developing innovative organo-silica adsorptive materials. These materials are an essential component in separation methodology used in chemical analysis, which in turn is central to chemical, biological, environmental, pharmaceutical, and other related sciences. The materials are based on silica structures and designed to have useful physicochemical characteristics with the goal of improving the currently used separation media, with consideration in the chemical analysis of contaminants. The research approach is targeting a flexible platform on which different separation materials could be synthesized, bringing new possibilities for their use in specific practical applications. The research activities will engage graduate and undergraduate students, including members of traditionally underrepresented groups, providing advanced training and skills in chemical analysis necessary for the modern-day workforce in the academic, pharmaceutical, and industrial chemical sectors.<br/> <br/>The research project is focused on the synthesis and the physicochemical characterization of organo-silica adsorbent materials. The adsorbent will be synthesized on core magnetic nanoparticles and core silica particles to be used in magnetic solid phase extraction (SPE) and in liquid chromatography (LC). The adsorbent material will consist of a silica-hybrid that will have a characteristic fibrous/dendritic-type structure, while containing azide-chemical functionalities at the surface, serving as a platform to react with chemical entities that will alter the surface chemical composition of the material via ?click? chemistry (copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cyclocondensation). The organo-silica surface will be modified with chemical functionalities (e.g., fluorocarbons, ion exchangers, and polar moieties) that will provide a set of different mixed-mode interactions in liquid phase separations. Through a systematic evaluation, using well-established techniques (e.g., infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, gas adsorption analysis, and scanning electron microscopy) the physicochemical properties of the materials will be established. LC and SPE will be used to examine the chromatographic and adsorptive performance of the newly synthesized materials, which will include the use of standard protocols to assess the selectivity and stability of the materials. The project holds promise for advancing knowledge in the field of adsorbent materials for use in separation methods. The new materials will be used in chemical analysis, for example, in the analysis of pollutants and pharmaceutical compounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these cases, animals will interact daily with unrelated individuals (e.g. friends, acquaintances, or strangers) across various social settings. Individuals that successfully navigate group living are considered prosocial compared to antisocial individuals that do not navigate group living with great success. Despite the importance of successful group social interaction, little is known about how the brain promotes prosocial behavior to allow individuals to enter a new social group and maintain group cohesion. The answers to these questions remain unknown because most neuroscience studies examine social behaviors between just two individuals that are either related (e.g. parent-offspring) or mates. For most animals, however, social interactions often occur in complex settings. This project uses a unique animal model, the spiny mouse, which lives in large mixed-sex groups comprised of related and unrelated individuals. This research will determine how the brain promotes initiation of contact with a new group, facilitates positive interactions with new groups members, and reinforces positive behaviors that enable group stability. Insights gained from this research will be foundational for examining how the brain promotes successful navigation of complex social environments and how individuals are able to thrive in groups, maintaining healthy relationships leading to stable communities. The studies will also incorporate outreach programs to work with children and adults at science festivals and develop a new outreach program called ""After Dark"" which will be a museum-based program that highlights group living animals.<br/><br/><br/>The brain can organize adaptive behavioral responses to complex social environments, yet we know little about how this is achieved, particularly when the social environment is a complex society of numerous interacting individuals. Indeed, within the realm of social neuroscience, most studies probe neural circuits underlying dyadic interactions. As a result, we know very little about how the brain modulates behavior in group contexts. To respond to an ever-changing social environment, central brain ?hubs? are likely necessary for organizing systematic responses to dynamic inputs. The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) is a multifunctional region that modulates physiological processes and behaviors that range from affiliation and parental care to aggression and anxiety. Although we know the PVN can produce numerous outputs, the downstream targets that the PVN acts on to produce them is less well understood. This project will test the hypothesis that hypothalamic suppression of fear neural circuitry facilitates indiscriminate social approach behavior to allow for the formation of new groups, and that hypothalamic promotion of reward circuit-mediated behavior reinforces affiliation in complex social environments to facilitate group cohesion. The researchers will use chemo- and functional-genetic approaches, along with a novel organism ? the highly social spiny mouse ? to identify neural circuits that promote social cohesion in complex groups. DREADDs and fiber photometry will be paired with machine learning and social network analysis of complex groups that will produce a neurobehavioral dataset that will provide insight into the brain mechanisms that make group living possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The task of extracting useful information from vast amounts of data typically leads to solving large-scale optimization problems. The size of such problems poses a variety of challenges for computation and is the bottleneck for further progress in applications. The investigator aims to advance techniques of large-scale optimization, with applications throughout science and engineering. The resulting algorithms will enable discovery of trends and patterns in the observed data and will enable accurate predictions about unobserved data. The technical aspects of the project combine elements from a variety of mathematical and applied disciplines, and an effective mix of numerical experimentation, teaching, and discovery is central to the proposal. Graduate students and postdocs will participate in all aspects of the project.<br/><br/>Statistical estimation, signal processing, and learning from data rely on solving challenging optimization problems that are large-scale, stochastic, nonsmooth, and often nonconvex. Despite such irregularity, the domains of typical optimization problems decompose into ?active manifolds?, which common algorithms ?identify? in finite time, thereby opening the door to second-order acceleration strategies. This project studies the stochastic subgradient method and its common variants, which power modern large-scale optimization, and its numerous applications in data science and engineering. The goal of the project is to investigate how the performance of influential stochastic algorithms benefit from active manifolds and to develop novel algorithms that exploit this structure. The strategy for achieving this goal will be based on a recently discovered family of regularity conditions---originating in stratification theory and semi-algebraic geometry---that have been shown to hold along active manifolds in concrete circumstances. Utilizing such regularity conditions for active manifolds, the investigator will develop new efficiency guarantees for the subgradient method, show that the algorithm converges only to local minimizers while bypassing all extraneous saddle points, and establish the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic gradient iterates.  In parallel, the investigator will explore the use of noise injection to learn the tangent spaces to the active manifold in order to accelerate the algorithm. This approach is highly interdisciplinary, relying on techniques from nonsmooth optimization, statistics, probability, and semialgebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Vision is necessary for survival in many species, but species can have very different visual requirements based on their environment, and we do not fully understand how species adapt to these different visual environments. Many animals have specialized regions in the retina, such as an area centralis (region of high cell density), a horizontal streak (elongated region of high cell density stretching across the retina), or a fovea (physical indentation in the retina). These specializations may help animals see in different visual environments, but this has not been tested using comparisons across multiple species, and the exact functions of these specializations are unknown. The retina also continues to develop postnatally or post-hatching, but this process is not well understood. Fish are excellent models for studying the functions and development of retinal specializations because they have evolved these specializations multiple times, and they experience many different visual environments, from the deep sea to bright and structurally complex coral reefs. The proposed project will combine evolutionary genomics with developmental biology in fish to study the evolution and development of retinal specializations. This will address fundamental questions about how the environment and development shape the biology and evolution of the eye.<br/><br/>The fellow will complete two aims: (1) Investigate the ecological significance and genetic basis of retinal specializations in a phylogenetic comparative framework; (2) Test the prediction that greater ecological changes across life stages lead to greater molecular divergence in fish retinas. In Aim 1, the fellow will use cell biology and microscopy techniques to collect data on retinal specializations from a large sample of fish species, then test if different retinal specializations are associated with different ecological traits in ray-finned fish after controlling for shared evolutionary history. Aim 2 will involve collecting single-cell sequencing data from multiple species and developmental time points to compare relative rates of divergence at different stages of development. The fellow will also mentor undergraduates, do outreach in public schools, present work at conferences, and publish in peer-reviewed journals.

Therefore, the development of numerous real-life systems can be more accurately explained through the application of distinct maps, that is, of transformations that vary with time, rather than by repeatedly applying the exact same transformation. It is intuitive to examine these issues using typical sequences of maps, which brings us to the concept of random dynamics. Theory of random dynamical systems goes back to Ulam and von Neumann, as well as to Kakutani. Since then, it turned into a well-developed area of mathematics that has numerous applications. But what if the distribution and strength of the random factors itself does not remain constant, but changes with time? That can be modeled by non-stationary random dynamical systems, and the study of the properties of such systems and of their applications is the main goal of this project. Mentoring students will be an essential part of the project. Numerous questions closely related to the proposed project will be suggested to graduate and undergraduate students initiating and increasing their involvement in research in mathematics.<br/><br/>In the first part of the project the goal will be to show that a smooth random dynamical system, under an assumption of absence of invariant measures, must lead to almost sure exponential growth of the norms of random compositions, even in non-stationary cases. Also, moduli of continuity of stationary measures will be studied. The second part of the project will lead to a non-stationary version of the Furstenberg Theorem on random matrix products, that claims that there exists a nonrandom sequence, a non-stationary analog of the Lyapunov exponent, that almost surely describes the behavior of the norms of random matrix products. Non-commutative versions of the Central Limit Theorem, the Iterated Logarithm Law, and other limit theorems will be proven in non-stationary settings, for random matrix products, and, more generally, for random walks on Lie groups. The third part of the project will provide the proof of Spectral and Dynamical Localization for the non-stationary Anderson Model (including the Anderson-Bernoulli case). Besides, the questions on topological structure of the spectrum and essential spectrum of the non-stationary Anderson Model will be addressed. In particular, it will be shown that for a discrete Schrödinger operator with potential given by a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables plus a quasiperiodic background the spectrum must consist of a finite number of intervals, while for a periodic background it can have infinitely many gaps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kaiser of the University of Hawaii is using crossed molecular beam experiments to study elementary atom-radical and radical-radical reactions of the simplest silicon-containing open shell reactants with prototype second row main group hydride radicals forming small silicon-bearing molecules under single collision conditions. These experiments are exceptionally challenging since they target previously unstudied bimolecular reactions of two open-shell transients involving the refractory element silicon. Professor Kaiser and his students will investigate the energy-dependent chemical dynamics of the bimolecular atom-radical and radical-radical reactions under single collision conditions utilizing a state-of-the-art, ultra-clean crossed molecular beam machine. The experimental results will be merged with ab initio and quasi classical trajectory calculations in collaboration with Professor Martin Head-Gordon (University of California, Berkeley). This study will provide excellent opportunities for the training of graduate and undergraduate students including women, veterans, along with indigenous Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, thus encouraging students to do hands-on research in reaction dynamics and preparing them for leadership positions in education and research. This project benefits society by incorporating outreach activities through the organization of a symposium on silicon chemistry, broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities, and enabling educators to incorporate research activities into school and college teaching.<br/><br/>This project focuses on synergistic experimental and computational studies of elementary reactions of two open shell reactants comprising the simplest silicon containing species [atomic silicon (Si) and the silylidyne radical (SiH)] and second row main group hydride radicals [methylidyne (CH), amino (NH2), hydroxyl (OH)]. The significance of this project is that our study provides new knowledge on the exotic main group silicon chemistry at the molecular level leading to archetype dinuclear silicon-bearing diatomics [SiE; E = C, N, O] along with their hydrogenated counterparts, of which many have been only predicted to exist theoretically. The results will also provide insight intol the underlying chemical dynamics and reaction mechanisms, expose the chemical bonding and molecular structure of small silicon-bearing systems, and provide a framework for considering silicon-based molecules as molecular building blocks of, for example, silicon carbide and silicate nanoparticles in the interstellar medium. These studies may change our perception on the concepts of chemical bonding, reactivity, and electronic structure of silicon in small molecules and how they compare to the isovalent carbon counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coastal wetlands are one of the largest natural sources of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, with most of the gas flux attributed to microbial processes in the sediment. In soil environments, fungi are significant contributors to nitrous oxide production, but in coastal wetlands the role of fungi is largely unknown. This project examines the role of understudied fungi in nitrous oxide production in salt marshes under varying environmental conditions in isolated fungal cultures and field-collected salt marsh sediments. Research findings are expected to improve future climate predictions and guide the restoration and management of salt marsh habitats to reduce nitrous oxide production. In addition to research training graduate and undergraduate students, this project will enhance scientific and conservation training to local high school students from diverse backgrounds through a partnership with a local zoo. <br/><br/>This project aims to estimate the overall contribution of fungi to nitrous oxide release from salt marsh sediments and determine the metabolic basis for fungal nitrous oxide production under different oxidation-reduction and nutrient conditions. The researchers will cultivate fungi isolated from marsh sediments and use transcriptional profiling to reveal key genes that control nitrous oxide production. They hypothesize that salt marsh fungi produce nitrous oxide primarily by the anaerobic respiration of nitrate or nitrite. The project will constrain the contribution of fungi to nitrous oxide production with novel 15N-tracer incubations and inhibition of either the prokaryotic (i.e., bacteria) or the eukaryotic (i.e., fungi) components of the microbial community.

Voluminous volcanic eruptions driven by deep mantle sources are thought to have caused global environmental changes. Dramatic compositional and thermal changes occur at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), about 3000 km below the Earth?s surface. These changes exert a primary influence on the cooling of the planet. They also influence the core dynamics, the Earth?s magnetic field, and mantle thermal convection. Yet, understanding the dynamics of the deep Earth is not trivial. Indeed, multidisciplinary efforts and state-of-the art techniques are required to tackle the complexity of the Earth system. Here, the researchers investigate enigmatic features observed at the core-mantle boundary. To unveil their origin, the team combines expertise in seismology, geodynamics, and experimental mineral physics. The researchers carry out experiments at the extreme pressures prevailing in the mantle. They measure the properties of materials anticipated to exist in of oceanic crustal material sinking to the CMB using powerful x-rays and infrared light at national synchrotron facilities. Taking advantage of recent advances in computational facilities, they simulate the interaction of candidate oceanic crustal materials with deep-mantle materials brought together by tectonic forces acting throughout Earth?s history to produce complex structures in the deep mantle. The results of the models will be compared with seismic observations of the Earth?s interior, testing our understanding of the dynamics of the deep Earth. The project provides support for the training of graduate students at the California Institute of Technology and fosters international collaboration with Australia.   <br/><br/>Seismologists have revealed that the mantle side of the CMB is extraordinarily heterogeneous, with km-scale fine structure that could harbor distinct chemical reservoirs. Thermal and chemical heterogeneity, solid-solid phase transitions, elastic anisotropy, variable viscosity, and melting are probably all required to explain the observed complexity. With expertise in seismology, geodynamics and experimental mineral physics, the team connects the atomic scale to the tectonic scale as linked to the temporal dimension through dynamics. This is accomplished through the measurement of the thermoelastic properties of deep Earth phases as compared to seismically observed structures predicted by mantle dynamics arising from reconstructions of Earth?s plate tectonic history. The researchers will conduct a systematic study of the Pacific large low seismic velocity province (LLSVP) and proximal surroundings. They use whole seismograms compared against synthetics generated from enhanced tomographic models and thermo-chemical convection models. The models integrate plate tectonic reconstructions constrained by observations and account for materials? physical properties, including elastic tensors and rheological properties. The experiments assess the sources of the seismic signatures of candidate deep hydrous phases in subducted slab.  They include: (1) shear-wave speed measurements using inelastic x-ray scattering techniques; and (2) thermal equation of state and stability constraints using x-ray diffraction and synchrotron infrared spectroscopy at lower mantle conditions. The study addresses fundamental questions, such as: can the presence of subducted slabs deform LLSVPs into seismically resolvable 3-D shapes with distinctive anisotropy and affect D"" topography? If hydrous phases can be transported into the lowermost mantle, are they seismically detectable and do they play a role in the stability of a thermo-chemical pile? This work will be accomplished through the training of three graduate students in cutting-edge techniques, and the collaborative project will enhance partnerships with Australian National University. Outreach activities through the Earthquake Fellows Program will include high school students from backgrounds underrepresented in the geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This makes it important for new products that better meet people's needs and that differ from existing ones. Creativity in Requirements Engineering (RE) emphasizes the key role of developing creative requirements that are both novel and appropriate for a given application. Existing approaches to promote requirements creativity, including multi-day workshops, tools, and frameworks, are time-consuming, often ineffective, and largely dependent on the requirements analyst's own creativity. Moreover, creativity has a number of facets that should be assessed independently, but the field of RE has few good tools for evaluating creativity. This project's goal is to use a range of artificial intelligence-based techniques both to help assess requirement creativity and to help software engineers develop more creative requirements. This will involve both developing interfaces that help engineers consider a wider range of possible requirements and a framework for evaluating creativity in RE. The research work will also support curriculum development, mentoring of student researchers, and creativity-focused training workshops for K-12 students, teachers, and software startups. The success of this project will advance fundamental knowledge in creative software development and impact local, state, and national economies by helping developers become creative software professionals and increasing the chance that products and companies succeed.<br/><br/>The project focuses on two main objectives.  The first main objective is to use data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques to generate potentially creative ideas based on existing online software-related content such as reviews, product descriptions, issue tracking systems, and forum discussions. These techniques will then be integrated into a support system to explore and select creative requirements with guided human intervention. The second main objective is to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the creativity of software requirements, based on well-established dimensions of creativity that include relevance and effectiveness, novelty, elegance, and genesis. These tools and scales will be validated through user studies including professional software developers and experts in RE. Providing an automated mechanism to support the discovery of creative requirements and a novel framework to evaluate the creativity of requirements, this project addresses the fundamental issues that act as barriers to the wide adoption of creativity in software requirements engineering.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Human Centered Computing (HCC), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Software & Hardware Foundations (SHF).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of this work will reveal why this bacterium is so efficient at invading mammals and creating infections in them.

This motility is driven by internal helical flagella that rotate in between the cell wall and the outer membrane. While past research elucidated some basic mechanisms of spirochete motility, many questions remain elusive. This research examines the bacterium that causes leptospirosis as it has a single flagellum at either end of the cell, thereby allowing direct analysis of the direction of rotation of the flagella and how it is impacted by different alterations and perturbations, while also providing a comparative analysis for previous work that has been done on the Lyme disease spirochete. Specifically, this research will assess the specific role of biophysical parameters and proteins on motility, determine the effect of external environment on movement, and determine whether mechanical cues are involved in chemotaxis.

One of the most common approaches to achieve such goals is via simple ""find and replace"" rules, also known as rewrite rules. Essentially, engineers specify a large set of rules which are then repeatedly applied one-after-another to simplify a better version of the original program. While this approach is simple, it requires substantial effort from experts to make it effective because the quality of the results depends heavily on the order in which the rules are run and there is no single best order for all programs. The investigators recently developed a new approach called Equality Saturation which enables repeatedly applying all the rules simultaneously, thus generating all versions of the program for all different orders of rewrites. Their framework called EGG has been used to build state-of-the-art compilers for Machine Learning applications, Computer-Aided Design tools for 3D printing, and to automatically repair rounding errors in scientific computations. However, the successes also highlighted some limitations that make it difficult for new users to adopt EGG and to scale applications built on EGG. The project seeks to address these challenges by establishing an open-source ecosystem around EGG to unify several recent advances in Equality Saturation and fostering a robust and sustainable community to support its use. The project's novelties are providing improved algorithms for EGG to find opportunities to apply rewrites more efficiently and supporting flexible mechanisms for selecting the ""best"" version of a program discovered during EGG's search. The project's impacts are scaling EGG to domains with larger programs and lowering the barrier to entry for new users who want to quickly and easily build state-of-the-art program analysis and transformation tools.<br/><br/>The technical approach of the project includes the implementation of novel relational e-matching algorithms for complex patterns, the adaptation of sketch-based extraction, and new techniques to support destructive rewriting. Destructive rewriting is very promising, essential in domains where associative and commutative rewrites lead to blow ups in the underlying equality graph (e-graph) data structure used to encode a set of terms modulo equivalence. In such domains, canonicalizing rewrites have proven promising, but encoding them in EGG previously required ad hoc manipulation of the e-graph. The investigators expect these advances to improve the performance and scalability of the existing EGG system. Additionally, new infrastructure to support debugging and visualization tools, reusable analyses and rulesets, educational and training resources, benchmark suites and datasets will be developed, to improve the usability of the system. Together, the investigators believe these innovations will establish the infrastructure necessary to enable a broad class of users to quickly and easily build program analyzers, optimizers, and synthesizers across diverse domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are particularly advantageous due to their simplicity and interpretability, making them well-suited for decision-making tasks, compared to complex neural networks that can be difficult to understand. However, despite their benefits, tree models are not immune to security and privacy concerns. Malicious actors can tamper with tree models or steal intellectual property, posing threats to the integrity and confidentiality of machine learning systems. Further, although there are studies of similar attacks on neural networks, differences between how neural networks and tree models work may affect how well those existing findings apply to tree models. Together, these issues mean there are a number of open questions around enhancing the security and trustworthiness of tree models. This project aims to develop novel strategies to address these questions and develop more robust and trustworthy AI-based systems, and develop both tools and educational opportunities through the work to make the findings widely available and impactful. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses the need for robust model authentication, watermarking for intellectual property tracing, machine unlearning for data privacy, and defense against backdoor attacks for tree models. The technical aims are organized around four tasks: a) Pursuing model identification by embedding unique signatures to generate differently embedded models; b) Developing novel methodologies of robust watermarking for tree models, for the purpose of tracing intellectual property; c) Designing novel algorithms for machine unlearning in tree models by exploiting tree reconstruction, residual-stable split, and combination of tree techniques; and d) Investigating the implications of backdoor attacks against tree models by leveraging the insights from the above tasks on tweaking tree models without significantly impacting the accuracy. These research efforts will contribute to the advancement of tree model security and trustworthiness, ensuring that these models can be reliably deployed in real-world applications while mitigating the risk of malicious attacks, unauthorized access, and privacy breaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Remarkably, nearly one fourth of known evolutionary origins of eusociality have occurred within a genus of sponge-dwelling snapping shrimps called Synalpheus. However, why and how eusociality evolved in these aquatic animals remains unclear and the answers to these questions may reveal potential universal requirements or consequences relating to advanced social complexity. This project seeks to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between species in this genus to identify morphological and genomic changes that are associated with the transitions to advanced sociality. The project will generate open access resources that will be used to test potentially universal ?laws? related to social evolution across animal lineages. The project will also support numerous research opportunities for undergraduate students as well as educational content for K-12 schools and web-based channels.<br/><br/>The project will generate genomic and phenotypic data spanning about 130 species of Synalpheus snapping shrimps worldwide. These data will be used to 1) reconstruct a dated phylogeny of Synalpheus taxa using phylogenomic methods; 2) evaluate the relationship between eusociality and molecular evolution; and 3) recover morphological preadaptations and consequences of eusociality. Genomic data will be sequenced through targeted enrichment of previously published and newly developed probe sets. Morphological data will be generated through traditional microscopy and X-ray based micro-CT-scanning of closely related species spanning different social organizations. Both genomic and phenotypic data will be analyzed using phylogenetic comparative methods enabled with initial phylogenetic products. Project activities will identify patterns of molecular evolution between eusocial and non-eusocial species to test hypotheses suggesting that social organization affects rates of molecular evolution via demographic effects such as reduced effective population sizes and increased generation time. Through 3D morphometric analyses, the project will work to uncover morphological preadaptations to eusocial origins, impacts of social behavior on morphological evolution, and putatively contingent or deterministic pathways toward convergent phenotypic syndromes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Financial intermediation consists of three activities: (i) the acquisition of loans from borrowers, (ii) the creation of mortgage-backed securities, and (iii) the servicing of these loans. A unique feature of the supply chain of mortgages in the US is the fact that roughly 50% of loans that are securitized each year are originated and serviced by different institutions. While there exist over 5,000 mortgage originators active in the retail origination market, fewer than 50 financial institutions supply over 90% of securities in the secondary market upstream. Since loans are re-sold often multiple times before being securitized, the cost of financial intermediation includes higher fees indirectly paid by consumers due to the asymmetric information that exists between the different parties at each level of the supply chain, as well as the profits margins that firms with market power potential extract from buying and selling these assets. The objective of this project is to quantify the relative importance of information and market-power frictions in determining the cost of intermediation, and ultimately their impact on the borrowing cost of consumers.<br/><br/>The main focus of the project is the interaction between the wholesale and secondary markets, and in particular the determinants of the wholesale prices and ex-post loan performance. A unique feature of the study is the use of high-frequency auction data for mortgages from one of the leading wholesale loan exchange platforms. The first objective of the study is to assemble the first available data set tracing the supply-chain of funds from origination to securitization. This is done by constructing a complete history of transactions, prices, security choices, and repayment decisions for a sample of mortgages. The second objective is to construct econometrics tests to measure the importance of asymmetric information in the market. The third objective is to estimate a structural model of loan valuation, using data on loan acquisition (bidding) and securitization (security characteristics choice). This model will be used to quantify each of the components of the cost of intermediation and to identify the sources of market imperfections that cause profit margins and intermediation costs to increase. The project will contribute to the literature by developing a new modeling framework to study the securitization and acquisition of loans; using tools from the Industrial Organization and Finance literatures.<br/>?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These studies will seek to examine the complex challenges associated with quantifying the chemistry of excited electronic states of transition metal cations and determining absolute energies differences between specific conformations of biomolecular ions. Professor Armentrout and his students will investigate angular momentum effects in collision-induced dissociation experiments, state-specific chemistry of transition metal (TM) ions, energetics for decomposition of protonated peptides along with their structures, as well as species formed by transition metal activation of C-H bonds involving methane and larger hydrocarbons. Their studies could lead to better understandings of spin-orbit coupling effects in reactions of transition metal ions, peptide degradation processes especially for conformation-specific energetics, and industrially important C-H bond activation and C-C coupling processes. In addition to these broader impacts in science, the work performed will also further the education of an informed science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, including both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Under this award, the Armentrout group at the University of Utah will examine several interrelated areas;  a recently developed IM source will be enhanced by the addition of novel ion sources and a compact SLIM (structures for lossless ion manipulation) device for enhanced resolution. The IM source will be used to study state-specific chemistry of TM ions and the energetics for decomposition of conformer-specific protonated peptides. The latter processes are important in understanding analytical applications for protein sequence identification and will experimentally establish the true ground conformer for the first time. Systems of focus will include those containing asparagine, where deamidation is believed to be a major molecular process contributing to aging and the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Infrared action spectroscopy will be used to determine structures of biological systems as well as to probe structures of species formed by CH bond activation and CC coupling reactions of TM cations with hydrocarbons. All areas of study will be complemented by theoretical calculations. Potentially transformative studies include quantitative characterization of spin-orbit coupling effects, absolute measurements of energy differences between conformations, and methane activation processes. In all these endeavors, the studies will provide thermodynamic data and educate future scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the last 20 years, the U.S. has seen a sharp decline in the number of women pursuing degrees in computing. This is a significant problem given the shortage of graduates qualified to pursue employment in computing. The project will identify how crowdsourcing-enabled pedagogy influences the engagement and learning outcomes of female students and will develop culturally relevant learning activities that can benefit all computing students. This project will provide early research exposure to female undergraduate students through participation in the research studies and co-authoring publications, which will, in turn, provide more exposure to young women's voices in the literature. The project has the potential to engage women as they are learning course material and building culturally relevant examples that could engage classmates.<br/><br/>The methodology will incorporate feminist pedagogy and learner sourcing in the development of a workflow that will enable students to contextualize and create worked-out examples. The approach will be an empirical deployment of the workflow in the scope of three programming classes. This project will study the effectiveness of customized computing learning in minority-serving, culturally relevant, and domain-specific contexts and investigate conditions under which improved student learning occurs. Results will advance the understanding of how learner sourcing approaches can be effectively integrated in the classroom. The teaching practices will be disseminated with an open-source web application, workshops and outreach efforts, and the design and development of guidelines and tutorials.

These particles seed the upper atmosphere with an array of metal ions and atoms which have important effects on the chemistry of the atmosphere and play a role in creating dust, which in turn seeds clouds.  This award will further develop the field of meteor physics through modeling meteor evolution from their point of entry into the atmosphere through their dissipation.  We will use radar observations to test our models and understandings. The research has a wide range of applications.  Spacecraft designers need to know the distribution of particle orbits and masses in order to reduce potential hazards. Solar system scientists use meteoroid population characteristics to better understand the outer solar system and its evolution. Atmospheric scientists apply meteoroid data to estimate the amount of material deposited in the upper atmosphere and its chemical evolution. A deeper understanding of meteor plasma physics will improve the broader scientific and engineering community?s knowledge of meteor and upper atmosphere geoscience.  This project involves members of underrepresented groups and supports graduate and undergraduate students.  The code developed will be open source. The team will continue their efforts to share their knowledge and enthusiasm about space and meteor science with the larger community through outreach to the media, K-12 schools, and at universities through public talks. This will broadly enhance STEM education and talent.  <br/><br/>Over the past decades, meteor researchers have used simulations, theory, and observations to study meteor plasma dynamics and their radar measurements. This award will extend this work to areas that remain poorly understood: the early stage of meteor ablation, the behavior of meteor-induced plasma waves, the interaction between a spatially variable atmosphere and meteors, and the scattering of radio waves by meteor plasmas. The team will generate new models more accurate and reliable than those that currently exist, and then apply these physics-based models to interpret data collected by radars.  This award will help answer the following questions: (1) How rapidly does ablation proceed for various meteoroids? (2) How do meteor plasmas evolve from their initial ablation and ionization through the early-stage kinetic expansion to their later-stage diffusion and turbulence? (3) Can more accurate theoretical and computational models improve researchers? quantitative understanding of radio wave scattering? (4) How do large-scale atmospheric inhomogeneities and neutral wind shears modify the evolution of long-lived plasma trails produced by meteoroids? Answering these questions will lead to progress in understanding atmospheric dynamics between 75 and 120 km altitude. It will provide better interpretations of measurements made by radar and optics.

The 3D LiDAR has important applications in environment management, forestry, land and corridor mapping, construction, land surveying, precision agriculture, powerline and infrastructure inspection, and countless other areas. The technology will bring significant economic impacts to the industries by reducing the ownership costs of a high-performance LiDAR system and the drone that can carry this system. The reduction of the entry-cost for LiDAR applications with drones will in turn benefit small businesses to perform smaller-scale projects in mapping and surveying. Other than drone-based applications, the innovation is poised to significantly reduce the costs and provide seamless integration of 3D LiDAR sensing in self-driving vehicles and other industrial applications including robotics, smart city infrastructure, surveillance, and security, as well as consumer applications like 3D sensing for augmented reality. The numerous applications enabled by the proposed project not will only help increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S. but also improve quality of life, security and safety.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims at developing a high-performance, compact, and light-weight 3D LiDAR sensor to meet the increasing needs of drone-based, high-precision LiDAR applications. Current commercial high-performance drone-LiDAR systems are notorious for their high cost, bulkiness, heavy weight, and high power-consumption.  Current drone-LiDAR systems are also prone to mechanical damage. These issues inevitably shorten the drone flight time, inhibit the installations of high-performance LiDAR systems on the more common consumer-grade small drones, and increase the operation costs. The proposed LiDAR sensor will mitigate all of these issues by leveraging a high-performance coherent LiDAR detection approach with silicon photonics technology in an innovative design. The coherent LiDAR detection method allows more sensitive measurements than the method used in most existing LiDAR systems. The technology achieves a longer detection range and larger number of returns given the same laser power. Based on highly scalable Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon photonics technology, the LiDAR sensor is able to achieve high spatial resolution in a compact size. The entire system will have a form-factor similar to a palm-sized compact camera commonly used for photogrammetry in small drones. The solution requires no mechanical mechanisms for beam scanning nor high-precision alignment of optical components, making the system inherently durable, compact, lightweight, and power efficient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This interest is due to the importance of these media in solid-state physics. Until the 1970s all materials studied consisted of periodic arrays or were amorphous. In the last decades a new class of solid-state matter, called aperiodic crystals, has been found. An aperiodic crystal is a long-range ordered structure but without lattice periodicity. It is found in a wide range of materials: organic and inorganic compounds, minerals (including a substantial portion of the earth's crust), metallic alloys (under various pressures and temperatures), and even some proteins. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognizes the discovery of quasicrystals, in which atoms are ordered over long distances but not in the periodically repeating arrangement of traditional crystals. The present research is focused on the investigation of the properties of such quasi-periodic structures using appropriate mathematical models. This study will lead to the understanding of the mechanism of electrical conductivity in modulated crystals, especially, of the phenomenon of the metal-insulator transition.<br/><br/>The proposed activity will lead to research in different classical as well as modern areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. This research combines powerful apparatus from the theory of partial differential equations, complex analysis, and others. Considered subjects are at the interfaces between pure mathematics, theoretical physics, and engineering. The proposed activity covers some old and new questions for almost-periodic structures which have a lot of applications in physics and engineering. The methods and constructions are quite intricate and are of great interest to both mathematicians and physicists. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of some very important questions in quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, the theory of quantum networks, spectral theory, spectral geometry, the theory of photonic crystals, and many others. The prospective results can explain or/and predict some effects which appear in experiments. Obtained improvements of different methods can be applied to the investigation of other mathematical and physical problems.

They also can catalyze innovation and mitigate complex problems. Current AI systems are not created in a way that is transparent making them a challenge to public trust. The opaque processes used produce results that are not well understood. Trust is further undermined by the harms that AI systems can cause. Those most affected are the communities excluded from participating in AI system developments. This lack of trustworthiness will result in slower adoption of these AI technologies. It is critical to AI innovation to include groups affected by the benefits and harms of these AI systems. The TRAILS (Trustworthy AI in Law and Society) Institute is a partnership of the University of Maryland, The George Washington University, Morgan State University, and Cornell University. It encourages community participation in AI development of techniques, tools, and scientific theories. Design and policy recommendations produced will promote the trustworthiness of AI systems. A first goal of the TRAILS Institute is to discover ways to change the design and development of AI systems. This will help communities make informed choices about AI technology adoption. A second goal is the development of best practices for industry and government. This will foster AI innovation while keeping communities safe, engaged, and informed. The TRAILS Institute has explicit plans for increasing participation of affected communities. This includes participation of K-12 education up through Congressional staff. These plans will elicit the concerns and expectations from the affected communities. They also provide improved understanding of the risks and benefits of AI-enabled systems.<br/><br/>The TRAILS Institute's research program identifies four key thrusts. These thrusts target key aspects of the AI system development lifecycle. The first is Social Values. It involves increasing participation throughout all aspects of AI development. This ensures the values produced by AI systems reflect community and interested parties? values. This includes participatory design with diverse communities. The result is community-based interventions and adaptations for the AI development lifecycle. The second thrust is Technical Design. It includes the development of algorithms to promote transparency and trust in AI. This includes the development of tools that increase robustness in AI systems. It also promotes user and developer understanding of how AI systems operate. The third trust is Socio-Technical Perceptions. This involves the development of novel measures including psychometric techniques and experimental paradigms. These measures will assess the interpretability and explainability of AI systems. This will enable a deeper understanding and perception of existing metrics and algorithms. This provides understanding of the values perceived and held by included community members. The fourth thrust is Governance. It includes documentation and analysis of governance regimes for both data and technologies. These provide the underpinning AI for the development of platform and technology regulation. Ethnographers will analyze the institute itself and partner organizations. They will document ways in which technical choices translate to governance impacts. The research focus is in two use-inspired areas. The first being information dissemination systems (e.g., social medial platforms). The second is energy-intensive systems (e.g., autonomous systems). The institute's education and workforce development efforts in AI include new educational offerings. These cater to many markets, ranging from secondary through executive education. The TRAILS Institute is especially focused on expanding access to foundational education. The focus is on historically marginalized and minoritized groups of learners and users. The institute will work with these communities to learn from, educate, and recruit participants. The focus is to retain, support, and empower those marginalized in mainstream AI. The integration of these communities into this AI research program broadens participation in AI development and governance.<br/><br/>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is partnering with NSF to provide funding for this Institute.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This year?s snow depth maximum is greater than 200% of the historical average and comes after more than 20 years of megadrought conditions for the region. The goal is to test the ability of geophysical techniques to capture the physical hydrological processes to improve estimates of the water budget of the Great Salt Lake (GSL) and the ecosystems of its wetlands. Research in the last decade demonstrates that Wasatch Mountain snowpack melts in the spring and is split between soil moisture and groundwater before becoming available as surface water. Geophysical observations can provide independent constraints to the hydrological system. This project aims to demonstrate that the geophysics data are uniquely suited to quantify the amount and time scales of water storage in seasonal snow, soil moisture, groundwater, and ultimately surface water storage in reservoirs and the Great Salt Lake. This project will contribute to a better understanding of the path that water takes from the mountains to the valley and may potentially help to guide decision/policy making for water use and consumption. The project supports undergraduates participating in data collection and analysis. The data collected through this experiment will be archived and made openly available through the SAGE-GAGE facility and the University of Utah data repository.<br/><br/>The RAPID project will yield new continuous seismic and episodic gravity and electronic resistivity tomography (ERT) observations at a high spatial resolution that will be used to determine the advantages and limitations of these geophysical techniques for investigating the transport and storage of water in the Wasatch Mountain/Salt Lake Valley hydrological system. Monitoring subsurface  seismic velocity changes will allow investigations of groundwater and soil moisture variation. Using gravity along with geodetic surface deformation modeling to determine changes in water mass over different but hydrologically connected (and physically proximal) regimes is a new and potentially valuable technique to monitor water mass transport from the mountains to the valley. ERT monitoring can be used to detect the migration of the fresh/saline interface at the edge of the Great Salt Lake as the snowmelt moves into the valley. By leveraging the complementary sensitivity of the geophysics observations, the proposed project will advance the spatial and temporal resolution of the measurements in the Wasatch Mountains and the Salt Lake Valley. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Geophysics Program, the Hydrological Sciences Program, and the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SHIPS will generate academic papers, public-facing reports, and make data trends easily digestible with interactive visualization and online dashboards.<br/><br/>The main goal of The State Health, Institutions, and Politics Survey is to provide high-quality state-level longitudinal data on public opinion, allowing researchers to track and document cross-country trends. The research team has developed and validated an approach that allows for the regular collection and post-stratification weighting of large census-balanced samples from every state and Washington, DC.  Large-scale survey waves with up to 25,000 respondents will be fielded at regular time intervals. The sample size will enable exploring heterogeneous effects and examining outcomes for small, difficult to study population subgroups. The project will also be flexible and reactive to sudden events that could prompt the need for immediate data collection. SHIPS will give scholars access to survey modules and results via a competitive application process.

Through a set of elegant chemical reactions, plants use solar energy to power the conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into stable sugars. These organic compounds, in turn, are used by the plant for growth and reproduction. Plant growth and reproductive output feed the world, and plant metabolism is a key determinant of atmospheric composition. Understanding how these three fundamental activities ? growth, metabolism, and reproduction -- are controlled by genes and the environment is a fundamental challenge for science to ensure the resilience of ecological and agricultural systems. This project uses a model grass species, Brachypodium distachyon, to disentangle the complex interactions between plant genetics and environment. There are three broad aims. First, to study the genetic basis of plant response to several environmental stressors to ask whether certain combinations of plant traits might be difficult to achieve over evolutionary time scales, or during breeding for crops. Second, to use genomics to identify specific genes ? and interactions among genes ? which control plant response to environmental stress. Finally, to study whether and how plants buffer the potentially destabilizing effects of environmental stress on their growth. These research aims will be complemented and expanded by developing a new undergraduate laboratory class, representing the first dedicated plant biology class at MIT. In this class, students will design and perform experiments exploring plant biochemistry, development, and responses to climate change.<br/><br/>This project investigates the molecular, physiological, and developmental basis of genotype by environment interaction, GxE. GxE is the observation that genetically distinct individuals respond to environmental cues in different ways. The project leverages the considerable genetic and genomic resources in the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon towards three specific aims. First, to ask how allelic function in one environment relates to functions in a second environment and whether genetic correlations between two environments might constrain organismal response to novel or challenging environments. These experiments use quantitative genetic approaches to understand the genetic architecture of environmentally responsive traits. Next, to investigate how interactions among genes at the molecular level shapes GxE, asking whether GxE in the transcript abundance of individual genes drives GxE in gene regulatory networks. Finally, to decompose the drivers of Relative Growth Rate to ask how genetic and environmental perturbations in key traits are (or are not) buffered to maintain stable RGR. These research aims will be complemented and extended by two educational aims. To develop the first stand-alone plant science class at MIT and introduce students to data generation and analysis in plants. This course specifically asks students to describe now genetics and the environment interact to produce phenotypic diversity, and the data generated will be used directly in the research aims of this project. In the second education aim, a field-based learning experience in Boston?s Arnold Arboretum will be developed for students to observe and interpret trait diversity in plants.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ACTION Institute will develop novel approaches that leverage artificial intelligence?informed by and working with experts in security operations?to perform security tasks rapidly and at scale, anticipating the moves of an adversary and taking corrective actions to protect the security of computer networks as well as people?s safety. The Institute will function as a nexus for the AI and cybersecurity communities, and its research efforts will be complemented by innovation in education from K-12 to postdoctoral students, the development of new tools for workforce development, and the creation of new opportunities for collaboration among the Institute?s organizations and with external industry partners. <br/><br/>The AI Institute will initiate a revolutionary approach to cybersecurity, in which AI-enabled intelligent security agents cooperate with humans across the cyber-defense life cycle to jointly improve the security posture of complex computer systems over time. Intelligent security agents will follow a new paradigm of continuous, lifelong learning both autonomously and in collaboration with human experts, supported by a shared knowledge bank and an integrated AI stack that provides novel fundamental primitives for (1) reasoning and learning that incorporates domain knowledge, (2) human-agent interaction, (3) multi-agent collaboration, and (4) strategic gaming and tactical planning. Over time, these intelligent security agents will improve their domain knowledge, becoming increasingly robust and effective in the face of changes in the adversaries? modes of operation, composing defense strategies and tactical plans in the presence of uncertainty, collaborating with each other and with humans for mutually complementary teaming, and adapting to unfamiliar and novel attacks.<br/><br/>The Department of Homeland Security and IBM are partnering with NSF to provide funding for this Institute.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalysts made with many metal constituents, referred to as ?high entropy alloys,? may offer new avenues for improved performance. However, understanding the multi-metal interactions is complex due to the large number of structures that form when mixing many metals together.  This collaborative research team will pursue an effort to identify and quantify these complex interactions in catalysts with up to five different metals using a structurally defined alloy, called an intermetallic, to reduce the structural complexity.  These alloys will contain from three to five different metals allowing the team to probe these complex metal interactions by systematically incorporating more metals into the alloy structure.  Using a combined experimental and computational approach, the team aims to understand the origin(s) of the catalytic behavior of compositionally-diverse intermetallics for selective hydrogenation of alkynes and alkenes.  Through this project, Drs. Rioux and Janik will help to train the next generation of catalytic scientists to solve fundamental and applied problems in chemical catalyst design and optimization.  There will a significant participation of undergraduates in research as part of this projecting, leveraging established recruitment programs at Pennsylvania State University.<br/><br/>The ?-brass intermetallic structure offers well-defined and controllable distribution of its atomic constituents among four symmetry inequivalent sites.  Precise stoichiometric control during solid-state synthesis enables preparation of M8-11Zn44-41 systems that distribute M (Pd, Ni) atoms either isolated by all Zn nearest neighbors or in small M3 clusters. Rioux and Janik of the Pennsylvania State University will prepare, characterize, and examine the reactivity of ternary, quaternary, and quinary ?-brass systems generated by substituting some number of Pt, Ir, Cu, and/or Au atoms.  Controlled introduction of compositional complexity is designed to enable the development of a quantitative catalysis science of high entropy materials through a combined, multi-faceted experimental and computational study.  H2-D2 exchange and ethylene hydrogenation are highly sensitive to the composition of the trimer sites, while selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene will probe selectivity on the trimer active site composition.  Interpretation of the observed catalytic activity-selectivity will be aided by rigorous characterization of ?-brass intermetallic microstructure, crystal structure, and methods to characterize the trimer sites present on ?-brass HEIs.  Computational efforts based on DFT- and cluster-expansion calculations will define stable bulk and surface trimer assemblies as a function of multinary ?-brass intermetallic composition.  DFT calculations of elementary reaction energetics will inform microkinetic models to compare rates, with the hypothesis that rates on surfaces distributing an array of site compositions will be a simple sum of rates on individual sites due to site isolation in the Zn host.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, online retailers must decide how to distribute their available inventory among geographically distributed warehouses, influencing individual order fulfillment decisions. In current practice the resource allocation decisions do not consider the nature of the operational decisions, which can result in significant losses in efficiency. This research project will contribute to the economic welfare of the nation by developing a general strategy for these problems that can be customized to different problem settings, providing a context-independent coordination mechanism that can be applied to many industries. The educational and outreach activities will involve students in hands-on optimization projects, create new education programs in datacentric decision-making, and address the food deserts problem in urban areas by viewing the problem from the lens of coordinating resource allocation decisions with real-time operations.<br/><br/>The current state of knowledge does not provide efficient algorithms for coordinating tactical resource allocation decisions with the operational decisions that use those resources. There are two main reasons for this gap: computing the optimal operational policy often requires solving a high-dimensional dynamic program, and the optimal value functions may lack structure, providing no clear basis for resource allocation decisions. This project will build a general approximation framework for coordination that is independent of the application setting. The framework uses surrogate functions to develop an upper bound on the performance of the optimal operational policy and a lower bound on that of an approximate operational policy. Bounding the relative gap between the two surrogates will yield a performance guarantee for the coordination problem. Selection of appropriate surrogate functions will allow application of the approximation framework to different applications, providing efficient approximate solutions with provable performance guarantees. To achieve such solutions, ideas from combinatorial and dynamic optimization, as well as discrete choice and price response modeling will be combined. The resulting algorithms will be tested on several publicly available datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These domains present critical challenges for decision-making as they require complex, potentially life-saving, decisions to be made under dynamic, uncertain and resource-constrained scenarios, while accounting for factors that are key to acceptance of the decisions, such as stakeholders' biases and perception of risk, trust, and equity. AI advancements and data availability can complement human limitations in navigating this complex decision space, however, current systems fail to account for the stakeholders' mental states and behavior. The AI institute for Societal Decision Making (AI-SDM) will target this opportunity at the confluence of social decision sciences and AI by developing human-centric AI for decision-making and inter-disciplinary training, to enable transformative solutions to societal decision challenges. By bringing AI and social science researchers, AI-SDM will enable emergency managers, public health officials, first responders, community workers, and the public to make quick, data-driven, and resource-efficient decisions, while also improving outcomes by accounting for human factors governing acceptance. The vision of AI-SDM will be realized via development of novel AI theory and methods, translational research, training, and outreach, enabled by partnerships among diverse universities, government organizations, corporate partners, community colleges, public libraries, and high schools.<br/><br/>The institute will establish the role of AI in advancing and bridging human and autonomous decision-making, under the use-inspired challenges of working in environments that are dynamic, uncertain, resource constrained, and require societal acceptance arising in public health crisis and disaster response. Specifically, the foundational research will develop (1) computational representations of human decision processes, (2) robust aggregation methods for collective decision-making, (3) multi-objective autonomous decision support tools, and corresponding innovations in (4) causal and counterfactual reasoning. These foundational foci are inspired by, and will be applied to, equitable resource allocation to improve public health and disaster outcomes, timely targeted interventions informed by human decision-making to encourage adherence to policy recommendations, and adoption of AI decision support by understanding how adoption can be modulated by different use patterns. The research will be guided by theoretical advances in computational cognitive science, social-choice theory, distribution-free statistics, game theory, casual and counterfactual reasoning, and interactive and autonomous machine learning. In addition to impacting use-case domains via a wide network of partners, AI-SDM will develop the next generation of workforce trained on human-centric AI and an AI-aware public via broader impact efforts including professional development workshops for high school educators, enrichment and leadership activities for under-represented students, inter-disciplinary degrees and courses, curriculum co-design with community college and educational partners, workforce training, and public engagement activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drought conditions have been connected to dune remobilization, which is the transition of a dune field from stable to active. Remobilization can have detrimental effects on those living in arid lands, including impacts on infrastructure, agriculture, and human health. To date, remobilization and its impact on surrounding communities has been noted in several studies from around the globe. While studies on dune remobilization exist, they often focus on dune fields after movement has begun. However, if remobilization can be detected in its early stages, it allows communities to engage in proactive dune management strategies rather than the reactive approaches being used in many places today. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project investigates sand dune remobilization to inform an early warning system for remobilization. First, a study of paleoclimate-dune interactions is undertaken to determine the climate required for modern remobilization. Sand dune formation, activity, and stabilization have often been correlated with changes in climate, so determining the climatic impact on sand dunes from the past can inform climate-dune interactions in the future. Second, connections between historical climate, drought, and vegetation change are established under the prediction that increased drought conditions will reduce vegetation. Vegetation is a landscape stabilizer, so tracking vegetation loss over time can provide an early warning of a soon-to-be remobilizing dune field. Lastly, dune color is presented as a proxy for the presence of sand grain coatings, which are comprised of iron and clay and act not only as a landscape stabilizer but also exhibit an orange-red color that can be observed using remotely sensed imagery. Research investigations will combine a suite of methods, including paleoenvironmental analyses, remote sensing, and scanning electron microscopy that have not yet been used together for dune remobilization studies. Research products and findings will inform an early warning system for dune remobilization in arid regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, while a recipe may say ?cut the onions?, it does not say that one ends up with onion pieces or that a knife was used. It is the natural economy of language that often makes life hard for current language processing tools. This project develops an approach called Dense Paraphrasing that enriches the surface language with paraphrases that reveal the deeper relations between words in a body of text, providing information needed by current models to make better inferences and judgments from the text.<br/><br/>In this project, we develop a model, Dense Paraphrasing, for text enrichment based on how a meaning can be associated with many different syntactic patterns in language. This project develops the process of integrating Dense Paraphrasing with Large Language Models, followed by an evaluation of the resulting system. This involves four subtasks, outlined here: (1) creation of a dataset that contains a rich annotation that makes explicit the hidden semantic relations in the text; (2) the development of baseline models for Dense Paraphrasing text generation systems that translate the source text into the ?dense? text form, by fine-tuning the Large Language Models; (3) applications of Dense Paraphrasing on downstream NLP tasks are explored, applied to the task of Question Answering; and (4) applied to a coreference resolution problem involving objects as they move or change through a sequence of events.

It is a concept with enormous unrealized potential. For example, no individual can read 100 million tweets or a century's worth of literature or all the New York Times articles ever written. However, by scaling up and harnessing data, a distant reading system can be created that does. The ""Science of Online Corpora, Knowledge, and Stories"" (SOCKS) project will undertake a grand challenge. The challenge will entail the construction and broad application of distant reading to advance the computational social sciences and digital humanities in the age of massive text-as-data online, in the same way that telescopes and microscopes have done for the physical and life sciences. This research capacity will assist in answering some enduring questions. How do ecologies of stories evolve? What insights can be derived from providing social scientists and humanities scholars with new computational instruments reflecting language use in their domain? To answer these questions and enable new programs of computationally aided research, SOCKS will advance a data-driven, computational, ""science of stories.""  SOCKS tools will harness the data revolution by supporting transdisciplinary research in data science, computational social science, digital humanities, and complex systems.  SOCKS will be administered by the University of Vermont & State Agricultural College in collaboration with five predominantly undergraduate universities: Champlain College, Middlebury College, Norwich University, Saint Michael's College, and Vermont Technical College.  <br/><br/>SOCKS will advance initiatives grounded in principled theory and methods through the quantitative measurement of sentiment and stories across a diverse portfolio of corpora.   New insights into the power and use of stories and narratives will be provided across a broad array of social, economic, and health domains through integrated data and teams. Stories are fundamental to how people comprehend, explain, and potentially shape their lives, the lives of others, and the world around them. Yet despite the power of stories, academic interest across many disciplines, and abundant online text-based corpora, a commensurate and accessible scientific platform for the measurement of stories that can support economies and communities, shape regional business strategy, and inform public policy is lacking. Building on the existing research infrastructure designed to measure and describe the shapes of stories within specific domains through meaning, characters, events, and narratives, new tools will extend n-gram analysis to the study of story-arcs and plots, and to apply theory-driven analysis to the study of stories and characters. Impacts from these data instruments will describe stories in an array of spaces including literature, mental health, public health, climate change, local and regional news media, immigration, and social media to discover plot lines, sentiment, new angles for digital marketing, and conspiratorial or mis-information campaigns. The platform will function in near real-time for social media and news; retrospectively for digitized literature, archival documents, and other recorded texts; and will extend to any evolving complex system comprising distinct narrative components.

Seemingly consistent with those modeling results, Arctic sea ice extent and total volume have decreased markedly since the turn of the century.  The expanded areas of the sea surface exposed to the atmosphere in summer are warming and ocean currents are carrying that heat below the ice-covered regions to drive additional ice melting from below.  Sustained observations of the rapidly-evolving Arctic Ocean are vital for documenting ongoing changes and exploring the responsible mechanisms, research that will ultimately lead to improved ability to forecast the future state of the Arctic.  This award will support annual deployments of autonomous, expendable instrument systems (called Ice-Tethered Profilers, ITP) that sample and report in real time the sea water temperature and salinity of the upper ocean as the buoys drift with their supporting sea ice floes, continuing an observational record initiated in 2004.  These data have proven to be a valuable resource for scientific research, student projects, and operational forecasting; to date, approximately 275 research papers have been published and numerous student dissertations written that have utilized ITP data.  Over the duration of this 5-year award, a total of 18 ITP systems will be constructed, tested and deployed in the Arctic on cruises of opportunity with the resulting data being made publicly available and preserved in national data archives.  Improved forecast skill based on these and other polar observations will allow more efficient planning for resilient coastal infrastructure, fishery and resource extraction, navigation, search and rescue activities and defense systems.<br/>    <br/>Begun in 2004, the Ice-Tethered Profiler program has annually fielded instrument systems distributed throughout the deep Arctic that return year-round daily vertical profiles of sea water temperature and salinity, and other water properties at sub-meter vertical resolution over depths of ~5 m to ~750 m as the buoys drift with their supporting ice floes.  A new variant of the ITP, the Tethered Ocean Profiler, TOP, focuses on waters from ~200 m depth up to within 15 cm of the ice-ocean interface.  The present award will continue and improve the ITP/TOP observing program for another 5 years.  A three-pronged effort is planned to consist of (1) annual deployments of operational ITPs and TOPs from Arctic cruises of opportunity and dissemination of the resulting data, (2) ongoing engineering efforts to keep abreast of the evolving supply chain for ITP/TOP components, and (3) quality control and scientific analysis of the resulting data with results published in peer-reviewed journals.

The team will create, characterize, simulate, and test how atoms of distinct metals move and facilitate reactions upon the surfaces of nanoparticles comprised primarily of gold with small amounts (1-5%) of a second element such as palladium or platinum. These materials are commonly described as single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts. These materials offer high rates and selectivities for numerous reactions important for domestic production of energy carriers and platform chemicals (e.g., valorization of biomass, shale gas, operation of fuel cells and electrolyzers). SAA currently suffer from a distressingly low number of active sites per gram of precious metal used. The collaborative team aims to develop methods to create SAA nanoparticles with smaller diameters (< 2 nm) to remedy this problem, and then test if the emergent and beneficial catalytic properties of these SAA are preserved as the size of the nanoparticles decreases. Here, the team will combine cutting-edge methods in quantum chemical simulations and multiscale modeling, characterization of operating catalysts using synchrotron methods, and catalyst testing and spectroscopy to learn how the nanoparticles restructure in different combinations of reactive gases relevant for catalysis (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide). Subsequently, the team will assess how rates and selectivities for a testbed reaction (reduction of oxygen with hydrogen) depend on the spatial organization of the atoms on the nanoparticle surface. Methods that will be developed will be useful for other dynamic catalyst systems and will be integrated into graduate-level courses. The proposed work involves lab-based education of graduate and undergraduate students and focused efforts to increase participation of women in catalysis science, especially with NSF REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) opportunities and cross-training of researchers across the three partnering institutions.<br/><br/>Under this award, the collaborative Flaherty/Hibbitts/Karim team aims to learn how the structure, dynamics, and catalytic properties of bimetallic and SAA materials depend upon mean particle diameters, composition, and support identity, all factors that impact the coordinative saturation of surface atoms and the identity of their nearest and next-nearest neighbor atoms. The team will couple precise synthesis, advanced characterization techniques (including n situ, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, microcalorimetry, infrared spectroscopy), and computational methods (simulations of full nanoparticles with density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo) to address the complexity and dynamics of SAA catalysts. A testbed reaction system with rates and selectivities proven to be structure-sensitive with respect to these materials (H2 + O2 ? H2O2) will be used to probe the surface structures of active catalysts, a challenge as the high pressures and complex solvents used often render characterization difficult. First, Au-rich bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (i.e., M1Aux materials, where M = Pd, Pt, Rh) with mean diameters of 1-2, ~6 and ~10 nm will be created, their post-synthesis structures will be characterized, and then the influence of adsorption and reactions on their structures will be examined over extended periods.  Second, the thermodynamic relationships among adsorption energies, active site motifs, and nanoparticle structure will be determined. Third, the fundamental connections surrounding  elemental identity, mole fraction, and coordination of the reactive metal and reaction rates, selectivities and barriers for H2O2 and H2O formation will be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Climate change?driven largely by carbon emissions to the atmosphere?and biodiversity loss are among the most difficult problems in ecosystem science. This project aims to improve our understanding of the link between climate change and biodiversity loss by predicting how animals control carbon in freshwater ecosystems. Freshwater bivalve mussels are among the most vulnerable species to climate change. Mussels also have calcium carbonate shells which store carbon and can indirectly affect carbon cycles. This project aims to identify biological traits in mussels that promote freshwater carbon storage and help guide mussel management and conservation initiatives that promote carbon storage, thus helping address climate and biodiversity challenges. The Fellow will also integrate their research with education by developing outreach programs intended to reach local underserved communities and teach the next generation of scientific professionals about the importance of freshwater biodiversity.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to synthesize data on phylogenetic history, functional trait phenotypes, and assemblage composition for freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) to predict the Rules of Life that govern animal effects on stream carbon cycles across the biomolecular, organismal, and ecosystem scales. This research will (i) determine how much variability in mussel trait phenotypes is explained by phylogenetic dissimilarity, (ii) calculate organism-level impacts of dominant mussel species with varying phenotypes on carbon pools and fluxes, and (iii) scale mussel-generated biogeochemical effects to the ecosystem level under different environmental contexts. The Fellow will test for links between phylogenetic identity and functional trait phenotypes using publicly available gene fragment data and an extensive mussel trait dataset including elemental composition, growth rates, thermal tolerances, and movement. The Fellow will also combine the trait dataset with a field experiment using metabolic incubation chambers to quantify how variation in mussels? traits impact carbon budgets under natural conditions, and scale mussel-driven impacts to the ecosystem scale using geospatial models. The Fellow will receive training in data synthesis and geospatial modelling, recruit and mentor undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds, and conduct outreach for students of all age ranges and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Almost all trees have helpful fungi growing on their roots: mycorrhizas. The fungi provide nutrients from soils and, in exchange, the trees feed these fungi carbon (sugars). Some of this carbon ends up trapped in soils. Forest soils store a large amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and mycorrhizas can help promote this carbon storage. However, we know little about how plant and fungal species differ in their carbon and nutrient trade economies. These differences could have major impacts on how forests are managed to promote soil carbon storage. This research will investigate how different plants and fungi trade carbon for nutrients and how much of this carbon gets transferred to soils. This information will be used to test whether mycorrhizal species can help better predict future soil carbon storage in forests. In addition, the fellow will communicate these findings through targeted workshops for primary school students at different age levels. The goal of these workshops will be to increase students? interest in science as a field and future career path. <br/><br/>The fellow will investigate species effects on mycorrhizal carbon allocation at spatially hierarchical scales ranging from the laboratory to across the continent. The project will test the hypothesis that mycorrhizal tree and fungal species modulate the exchange rate of carbon and nutrients based on surrounding environmental conditions, with this economy ultimately influencing overall soil carbon storage in forests. Using isotopic labeling, the ?carbon cost? of different mycorrhizal fungal species will be measured from cultured fungi. This experiment will be juxtaposed by measuring belowground ?carbon supply? from a plant biodiversity experiment, where various tree species have been planted under similar conditions. The relative variation observed among plant and fungal species from these experiments will be compared with soil carbon measurements taken from forests across the United States to assess the degree to which species-level information can effectively predict soil carbon storage. Throughout these experiments, undergraduates from diverse backgrounds will be recruited and trained, and community outreach events will be organized focused on youth organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the properties of the oceanic flow field at intermediate scales, referred to as the submesoscales, have remained relatively elusive because of observational limitations: most high-resolution in-situ observational measurements have limited spatial range while satellite-based velocity estimates have limited spatial resolution. In addition, satellite-based surface velocities are estimated using the simplified physics assumptions (geostrophy), which breaks down at the submesoscales. Overall, a global view of kinetic energy as a function of length scale in the submesoscale range is not currently available. The primary goals of this project are i) to estimate kinetic energy distribution and transfers at submesoscales, ii) to understand the role of balanced and wave-like flow components in setting these submesoscale energetics, and iii) to quantify how and assess why these submesoscale flow properties vary globally. This research will quantify global submesoscale kinetic energy content, its dynamical characteristics, and transfers as a function of spatial-scale, using existing surface drifter observations from NOAA. Global observations of kinetic energy at these scales have never been examined before: this work is a unique opportunity to characterize the spatial patterns and seasonal variability of ocean submesoscale flows, and to assess the effects of mixed layer depth and surface forcing on energy content at these scales. These estimates will provide the first global observational baseline to compare against future observations and high-resolution simulations, and one such comparison will be performed in this work. In addition, these observations will elucidate the energy budget of the global ocean by quantifying energy transfers across scales. In coarse resolution climate models, subgrid-scale parameterizations represent the effects of submesoscale motions: the baseline provided by this work will help improve these parameterizations in the future. The analysis will provide a useful ground truth to validate and calibrate future satellite observations, and to quantify biases in high resolution ocean models. Improved understanding of ocean energetics also has direct relevance for the development of better subgrid scale parameterizations for ocean and climate models. Additionally, this project will generate documented and open-source Python code for processing observational and synthetic Lagrangian data for future studies of ocean energetics. In terms of workforce training, this project will support one graduate student, who will learn how to analyze high-resolution model data using parallel processing tools in Python.

Good shape matching methods lead to many useful outcomes including a better understanding of human health, consumer preferences, and patterns in nature. The Frechet distance is often used for shape matching curves describing the movement of people or the shapes of the proteins used as the building blocks of the human body. Its popularity is largely due to its many nice mathematical properties, but there are several issues with its use on real-world data which is often large and messy in nature. Also, the possibilities for expanding its use to settings other than curves are not as well understood. The project seeks to study Frechet distance computing in the presence of messy data. It seeks new methods for computing Frechet distance that can be done quickly even for complicated curves. It also seeks ways to extend the main mathematical ideas behind the Frechet distances to data types other than curves. The project is collaborative and will lead to exchange of knowledge and student training opportunities between the investigators' institutions. It will lead to new shape matching software being made freely available to those who will find it useful.<br/><br/>The research activities have three components reflecting the expertise of the project's team of lead researchers. The first component specifically seeks new algorithms for studying messy curve data, focusing on problems designed to address noise and misalignments of the curves' representations.

The third component seeks to apply insights made from work on the first two components to design new algorithms for extensions of the Frechet distance, including a novel interpretation of the so-called discrete Frechet distance in surfaces.

Many species of diatoms produce chemical signals called oxylipins under stressful circumstances such as nutrient limitation, wounding due to grazing, and viral infection. These chemical signals are detrimental to many organisms that make up microbial food webs in the ocean, like other eukaryotic phytoplankton, microzooplankton and copepods that graze on phytoplankton, and free-living bacteria. However, particle-associated bacterial communities are stimulated by low doses of oxylipins, and diatoms can use these chemical signals to communicate amongst themselves about impending stress. Because these microbial food webs play a critical role in the Earth?s carbon cycle and these ecosystems ultimately support fisheries, it is important to understand the role chemical signaling plays as diatom blooms spin up and crash in productive upwelling regions. Here the investigators propose a field expedition with a series of deck-board incubations to study the effects of oxylipins on community dynamics in the California Current Ecosystem. The team also proposes a series of laboratory-based predator-prey studies to quantify the effects of oxylipins on microzooplankton grazers by documenting behavior with microvideography. The major questions that will be addressed include: 1) how does the concentration and diversity of oxylipins change over the course of a bloom? 2) what is the net impact of oxylipin signaling on community dynamics? 3) how do oxylipins impact carbon export and nutrient recycling (N, P, Si)? Outreach activities undertaken during the lifetime of this grant have the primary goals of introducing young people to microbial oceanography, training the oceanographic workforce, and creating content that can be accessed by inquiring minds after the lifetime of this grant. To accomplish this, undergraduate and graduate scientists are being trained during this project through direct participation on the planned cruise, in the lab, and in classrooms through virtual live-streaming cruise activities and in-person teaching. This project also uses cruise data to design data-analysis tutorials and workshops in order to engage the broader science community. Middle and high school students from local urban areas are also being trained on educational day trips in the coastal waters around Cape Cod. A curriculum is being developed for grade 8-12 classrooms related to the work of this project.<br/> <br/>This is the first study to profile the full diversity of oxylipins produced across dissolved, cellular, and detrital (i.e., marine snow) fractions. It is the first study to simultaneously assess in situ drivers of oxylipin production (nutrient stress, grazing, and viral infection) within an ecosystem. The project is also be the first to fully characterize oxylipin concentrations and diversity over the course of a bloom within an Eastern Boundary Current. The ultimate goal of this project is to understand how oxylipin-mediated signaling impacts the fate of carbon, so the team will be monitoring export efficiency, net primary productivity, bacterial productivity, and nutrient recycling throughout the field campaign. This project adds to the relatively small number of metatranscriptomic datasets from sinking particle communities and marine lipidomic datasets available in public repositories. The data generated by the Lagrangian Study can be used to ask more general questions about connectivity between the surface and deep ocean, community succession, and the geochemical evolution of blooms. Finally, the proposed research transforms our collective understanding of how chemical signaling impacts grazing behavior and the mechanism of oxylipin grazing deterrence by simultaneously assessing grazing rates, selection, and behavior of microzooplankton in the presence of exogenous oxylipins and when offered high and low oxylipin-producing prey. State-of-the-art microvideography visualizes and quantifies microzooplankton grazing behaviors, and the system will be adapted for measurements of natural communities at sea.  <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Programs in the Division of Ocean Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computational healthcare ? a data-driven machine learning approach for healthcare, has a tremendous potential to advance and revolutionize healthcare by supporting the evidence-based practice of medicine, personalizing patient treatments, and reducing costs. Unlocking this potential requires the seamless integration of health data from multiple stakeholders such as patients, hospitals, providers, and local, state, and national agencies, and protection against the dangers of compromise or misuse of the information. However, integrating health data from multiple stakeholders is prohibitive due to cost, patient privacy risk, and data protection regulations. To tackle these important challenges, stakeholders can collaborate to jointly build and evaluate machine learning models without sharing data using a decentralized machine learning approach called Federated Learning. However, using federated learning in the healthcare domain is fragile due to a multitude of challenges, including heterogeneous patient data and varying computational resources at the stakeholders? sites, limited data availability for diseases and patients, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks on the data and models ? all of these limit federated machine learning model development. This project addresses these fundamental challenges of federated learning for healthcare by pioneering next-generation robust and trustworthy federated learning algorithms and methods for the generation, assimilation, and analysis of heterogeneous data for computational healthcare applications, contributing to the national effort toward precision medicine initiatives. The project will have a real-world impact by accelerating medical discovery and aiding in clinical decision-making in several ways: (a) securely integrating and learning from distributed heterogeneous siloes of health data; (b) yielding robust representations of diseases and patients; (c) building clinicians? and patients? trust in the data-driven methods by providing a flexible open-sourced evaluation toolkit. This project will also have a significant educational and outreach impact via interdisciplinary research training and skills development of undergraduate and graduate students through coursework and real-world healthcare projects with medical experts. Directed efforts will be undertaken to broaden the participation of women, underrepresented and K-12 groups in STEM education.<br/><br/>This project will develop new algorithms, methodologies, and software to improve data-driven federated learning for computational healthcare - by advancing the state-of-the-art in multi-view learning, adversarial learning, and machine unlearning. This project?s overarching theme is robustness and trustworthiness, and is organized into three interrelated thrusts. The first thrust of the project focuses on ?robust federated learning?, and it involves developing multi-view federated learning algorithms and coded federated learning methods to address the statistical and system heterogeneity challenges inherent in healthcare settings. The second thrust of the project is focused on ?trustworthy federated learning?, under which novel federated adversarial training and verifiable federated unlearning algorithms will be developed to achieve resiliency to adversarial attacks and data-deletion requests, and fair and interpretable algorithms will be employed to make the proposed federated learning solutions unbiased and equitable to all patients and stakeholders. Finally, in the third thrust of the project, the researchers will study and develop algorithms for generating and evaluating realistic synthetic health data for federated learning to enable reproducibility and accelerate the development of federated learning methods in healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the potential energy surface in quantum chemistry is the landscape of the dependence of an eigenvalue on the atoms' positions within the molecule; in this landscape, electrons seek out the lowest point, forcing the molecule into the corresponding configuration. Study of pattern-formation in reaction-diffusion systems can similarly lead to the question of optimizing energy (eigenvalue) of a partition of the available space; this question is known as the ?spectral minimal partition problem?. The common feature of these two examples is a very large number of parameters. The underlying idea of the present project is that when the number of parameters is sufficiently large, it is possible to obtain global information about the operator family from the local information about the eigenvalue behavior. A practically important consequence of this is the ability to certify an experimentally found local minimum as being globally optimal. Questions from this project will be used to mentor graduate and undergraduate researchers, and a WikiBook devoted to spectral analysis on metric graphs will be created and maintained.<br/><br/>The specific mathematical question to be addressed in the project is the eigenvalue dependence on the boundary conditions, which is directly related to the location of the partition boundaries in the ?spectral minimal partition problem?. On the operator-theoretic level, this will be expressed as variation of the self-adjoint extension of a fixed symmetric operator. The goal is to prove a link between the Morse index of the eigenvalue at a critical point and the spectral shift of the operator with respect to a reference operator. Since the Morse index describes local stability of the eigenvalue with respect to perturbations in the boundary conditions, this link will allow one to obtain global information in the form of the spectral shift. The knowledge of spectral shift will then lead to bounds on the energy landscape which, in turn, will certify the local minimum as being globally optimal. The tools used for establishing the link will include parametrization of self-adjoint extensions by the Lagrangian Grassmannian, the Krein-Naimark resolvent formula, Dirichlet-to-Neumann map and the Maslov index techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many applications, one has access to vast amounts of data, but the data is highly noisy and only meaningful when aggregated. For example, in cryo-electron microscopy, one has access to a large volume of molecular images. Still, each image is highly noisy and reflects a random shift, orientation, and projection, making integration highly challenging. Another example is microarray expression data, which is generally collected in small batches with significant batch effects. The traditional statistical approach is to ?standardize the data? before integration, i.e., one subtracts the mean and scales by the standard deviation in each batch and then combines the standardized batches. However, when the sample size of each batch/subpopulation is small, this approach will fail since within-batch estimates of mean and variance can be unreliable. This project will develop computationally efficient and scalable methods for aggregating noisy data from multiple sources. The methodology will be applied to data from the criminal justice system to gain insights into race and gender-based discrepancies. The project will support several tiers of mentorship as well as graduate and undergraduate research and will contribute publicly available code. In addition, the research will also serve as a bridge between the fields of signal processing and statistics. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop mathematical tools for data aggregation invariant to the first and second moments of the data in two distinct contexts. The first context is data aggregation for multi-reference alignment (MRA), a topic motivated by biological applications such as cryo-electron microscopy. In classic MRA one attempts to recover a hidden signal from many noisy observations, where each noisy observation has been randomly translated and corrupted by additive noise. The investigators will explore a generalization of this model where each noisy observation is also corrupted by a random scale change. The research will develop a computationally efficient method for full signal recovery that utilizes Fourier and wavelet-based features to unbias the noisy data for the random scale change. The second context is data aggregation for distribution learning. The investigators consider the scenario where data is collected from various sub-populations to produce data batches, but the sample sizes of the batches are small. Under a simple but compelling model, localization factors affect only the first and second moments of the sub-populations, so that each batch consists of independent, identically distributed observations from some shifted and rescaled universal distribution function. The goal is to recover the underlying distribution by aggregating the sparse data. This is a highly relevant problem, as it allows for reliable nonparametric estimates of the density in settings where traditional approaches fail and, more broadly, leads to more precise comparisons across sub-populations in settings where little data is available. By viewing this problem as a generalized MRA problem where uncertainty due to random sampling replaces Gaussian noise, this project contributes an innovative set of tools for its solution inspired by methods in signal processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is not surprising, therefore, that many software engineering educators want to use OSS projects as a training ground for students to gain experience with real world software development problems.  These experiences carry the added benefit that students contribute to the evolution of projects relevant to society and their own interests. Successful participation in open source projects also increases students' chances for professional success. However, students onboarding to OSS face many difficulties.

As people age, the cartilage in their joints can break down, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. This makes performing everyday activities, like walking, climbing stairs, and even getting out of a chair, very difficult. Although there are treatments available for osteoarthritis, like oral pain medication and injections, they only provide temporary relief and do not cure the disease. As a result, surgery that replaces the damaged joint with an artificial one could be the only viable option.  However, this surgery is a very difficult procedure that requires a lengthy recovery period and carries additional risks for seniors with underlying health conditions. Use of nanoparticles can potentially help in treating the early stages of tissue failures but there is a lack of knowledge about their interactions with biological tissues. That is why the goal of this project is to understand the processes happening upon nanoparticles contacting heathy and damaged tissues. The researchers propose to focus on diamond nanoparticles as a controlled system of study. The project will focus on  understanding the mechanisms of interactions of these tiny particles with biological tissues and immune cell. In addition to the research itself, this project also aims to provide educational opportunities for students in the fields of materials science, biomedical engineering, and surface science. By engaging more students, especially women and minorities, the project will create a more diverse and inclusive scientific community, enabling new discoveries and innovations in the STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>In the early stages of osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down and the joint becomes inflamed, leading to pain and reduced mobility. One of the major challenges preventing the development of effective osteoarthritis treatment is the lack of understanding how the different mechanical, biochemical, and cellular processes within the joint interact with each other. This project aims to address this challenge by studying how diamond nanoparticles interact with joint cells and tissues to reduce damage and inflammation. The researchers will examine the effects of diamond nanoparticles on biological tissues and how they impact cell health as a function of the surface functionalization. The functionalized nanodiamonds will be analyzed for their ability to stay dispersed in body fluids and to escape macrophage attack to establish the correlation between the functionalization and the biocompatibility potential. Acquiring this essential knowledge will aid in comprehending the interactions between nanomaterials and biological cells, which will have a significant  broader impact on the advancement of nanoparticle-based treatments and therapies. This will be particularly useful for treating joint-related conditions such as osteoarthritis, leading to decreased pain, improved mobility, and the prevention of further joint damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These layered transition metal carbides and nitrides have the chemical formula of Mn+1XnTx (n=1-3), where M is a transition metal, X is either carbon or nitrogen, and Tx is either O, OH, F, Cl, or other surface groups that are bonded to the transition metal of the two-dimensional MXene layer. This project focuses on developing an atomic-scale understanding of the optical properties of MXenes, including their tunable plasmon resonances in the visible and near-infrared regime, which can be used for applications in nano-photonics or plasmonics. It is the PI?s hypothesis that different functional groups, Tx, control not only the layer-to-layer spacings of the two-dimensional MXene layers, but also provide the ability to tune the interactions between MXene layers as well as the density of free charges in each layer. Ti3C2 and Ti2C-based MXenes with a single type of surface termination will be used to study the atomic, electronic and plasmonic structures high-resolution electron microscopy and spectroscopy. Access to unique instrumentation at University of Illinois - Chicago (UIC) will be leveraged to study these materials over a wide range of temperatures and with unprecedented spatial and energy resolution. The project?s research activities center around hands-on research and learning experiences for science and engineering undergraduate and graduate students at the UIC, a Research-1 Hispanic-serving institution.  Recruitment and training focuses on the next generation of researchers, in particular involving students from underrepresented groups and minorities through a student exchange program with Tecnologico de Monterrey,  Latin@s Gaining Access to Networks for Advancement in Science and the DuSable Scholars programs. The participation of undergraduate students in active research projects is fostered through the PI?s Journal of Undergraduate Research at the University of Illinois - Chicago.

Twisted bi-layer MXenes exhibiting Moiré lattice effects will be studied for the emergence of hybridized plasmons or excitons, as well as other emerging, potentially strongly correlated phenomena. Using autonomous anomaly detection in multi-dimensional data cubes via machine learning (ML), the correlation between structural defects and their impact on the plasmonic and photonic properties will be studied. This research project will consist of two tasks, i) atomic-resolution analysis of MXenes and ii) development of convolutional neural networks to identify crystal defects in atomic-resolution STEM images and identify the correlated changes in the low-loss or valence EELS. The insights from both tasks will be combined, yielding the ability to measure and control the optical or electronic, and possibly even magnetic properties of single-functionalized MXenes. The integration of research and education through the training of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy and state-of-the-art ML approaches is an integral feature of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do this, new ways to harvest the properties of these materials should be found. One route is engineering atomic-level defects naturally present in these nanomaterials. While all crystalline nanomaterials have variety of defects in them, some defects are more promising than others. One dimensional defects, often referred to as line defects, are only a-few-atoms-wide and run along the entire crystal. This is an excellent opportunity to engineer them to get the properties wanted. Since they are only a-few-atoms-wide, they are intriguing objects embedded inside the main material, and they can have new and exciting properties that are unique to them. Study of these line defects requires ultra-high-resolution microscopes with features that can probe the properties of these defects. This project employs specialized analytical scanning transmission electron microscopes to study the identities, properties, and origins of these line defects. Combining these observations with theoretical predictions will provide additional flexibility when characterizing the defects. Perovskite oxide thin films have proven to be excellent hosts for such defects. The results will affect not only the science of defects in perovskite crystals, but also affect next-generation nanomaterial engineering by defect engineering. Within the framework of this project, high-school students will visit the University of Minnesota to have interactive tours of the Electron Microscopy Center at the Characterization Facility and see high-resolution electron microscopes in action. This outreach educational activity will be an academic-year-long program. Each year, groups of students and teachers from local high schools will participate in these tours, including schools with a considerable minority student population. Such a real-time dive into the structure of the materials and the operations of advanced electron microscopes should inspire students to pursue technical disciplines in college. It should also help teachers better convey to their students the science behind nanomaterials and microscopes using images obtained during their University of Minnesota visit. <br/>Technical Summary<br/>Advances over the past two decades have shown large numbers of materials can be scientifically exciting and technologically desirable when they have dimensions at the nanometer scale. Discoveries of new phenomena unique to nanoscale materials are being made almost daily, ranging from new physics?such as quantum transport of qubits in semiconductor nanowires or tetradymite chalcogenides being topological insulators?to new applications. Identifying the next frontiers in nanomaterials becomes more-and-more relevant. A new path for exciting new science and next-generation technology is possible through exploring and engineering the naturally-occurring defects in nanoscale materials, especially extended defects. These extended line (or 1D, dislocations and disclination, etc.) and planar (or 2D, grain boundaries, stacking faults, etc.) defects are particularly promising because they run across the entire crystal in one or two directions and are atomically small in other directions. Among them, line defects are only a-few-atoms-wide in two directions and extended in the third direction. With such natural geometry, it is expected that the properties of 1D defects should resemble a chain of atoms or a chain of single-unit cells. These defects should be rich with new physics and new quantum materials? phenomena not seen in 2D materials. Nanostructures containing them could take advantage of both the features of the defect and the host. The study of new defects ? understanding their properties and engineering them into new structures ? is the main topic of this project, and it could be what is next in nanomaterials. Determining the effects of key factors (such as composition, strain, and temperature) on formation of line defects and their rearrangements in perovskite oxides are central aims of this work. Perovskite oxides (ABO3), are highly flexible and can accommodate various types of distortions, due to their complex structure. Such structural flexibility allows the perovskite host to accommodate unique extended defects, including those of different compositions. Thus, exploring such non-conventional defects in perovskite oxides has the potential to be extremely fruitful, largely expand the fundamental science of ceramic crystals, and transform next-generation nanomaterials. This study of non-conventional 1D line defects in perovskite oxides will be conducted ex-situ and in-situ using atomic-resolution, analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) aided by density function tehroy (DFT) calculations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tunable properties of liquid crystals that result from this sensitivity have enabled revolutions in display technology and optical sensors. Over the past decade, a new class of liquid crystals has gained increasing attention, so-called lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals. These are water-based bio-compatible materials that therefore offer novel opportunities in biosensing and microfluidic applications. To fully harness their vastly unexplored potential, it needs to be understood how these liquid crystals respond to flow. Such an understanding, however, is currently lacking. Remarkably, flow can induce large-scale ordered structures. This project explores how these structures spontaneously emerge and how they can be controlled by tuning the flow and material properties. Integrated into the research is a comprehensive outreach plan that includes lectures for high-school students and teachers, research internships for undergraduates, and laboratory workshops for women high-school students. The project will present live science and art performances that will integrate visual, audio and dance elements to engage a broad audience in genuine scientific dialogue.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The research probes the conditions under which self-organized structuring can be achieved in flowing nematic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal solutions. Using a combination of advanced microscopy techniques, stability analyses, and numerical simulations, the project addresses how instabilities of the director field can trigger flow structuring and how these unstable configurations relax into macroscopic domains. In particular, two steady-state flow-induced textures are investigated: a periodic stripe pattern that occurs for planar surface anchoring conditions when the alignment is parallel to the flow direction and a band texture that emerges for a planar alignment perpendicular to the flow direction. Excitingly, the periodic stripe pattern is chiral: its mirror image cannot be superimposed on the original. This is remarkable, as the liquid crystalline units themselves are achiral, and achiral nematic liquids are generally expected to form achiral structures. The project aims to reveal the mechanism for the mirror symmetry breaking. By establishing the role of the surface anchoring conditions, the flow, and the material properties for the selection of characteristic length scales and macroscopic textures, the work will open the path to exploit flow as a simple and non-invasive pathway to intricate ordered structuring of complex fluids.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first method will exploit the intuition that in many practical situations, although the system contains numerous degrees of freedom, the relevant information is contained in a much smaller set of variables. The project will aim to quantify this intuition by developing the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. The second method aims to represent a given complex system as the transformation of a much simpler system. The project also includes educational efforts, including mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and the dissemination of the work in professional meetings and to the public. <br/><br/>The long-term goal is to improve understanding of high-dimensional probability measures via two approaches.  The first approach is to develop an original concept of intrinsic dimensionality in the context of functional inequalities. The notion of dimension plays a crucial role in functional inequalities via the curvature-dimension condition, but it ignores the fact that the measures of interest can live on lower-dimensional spaces. This omission can lead to inefficient functional inequalities; this project hopes to bridge this gap. The second approach is to develop new measure transportation methods based on stochastic processes and probabilistic flows. For example, Lipschitz transport maps provide a powerful way to transfer functional inequalities from simple source measures to complicated target measures. Only a few such Lipschitz transport maps are known to exist, which limits the applicability of the transport method. The project will utilize the tools of stochastic analysis and renormalization group methods to build transport maps with desirable regularity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scott Hartley of Miami University will investigate methods by which the folding of non-biological molecules can be controlled. Biochemical systems make use of molecules that are both large and structurally complex. This combination is necessary for the remarkable sophistication, and thus function, of biochemical systems. Constructing comparable non-biological molecules is currently beyond the capabilities of synthetic chemistry. Nature?s strategy for generating structural complexity is by folding a long chain molecule into a specific shape. This research project aims to increase our understanding of the factors that govern the folding of long chain molecules. The ability to control molecular folding into complex 3D structures is important for advanced applications in molecular recognition and catalysis.  The work will involve graduate students and undergraduates, who will be trained in synthetic and physical organic chemistry. Additional broader impacts include the development of a new teaching laboratory activity on attractive interactions relevant to molecular folding and work with a program from a consortium of Ohio universities supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds.<br/><br/>This project aims to study the folding of a class of non-biological molecules called ?foldamers? and to develop two strategies for controlling their folding into 3D structures.  More specifically, this project will focus on studying ortho-arylene foldamers. ortho-Phenylenes are a simple class of aromatic foldamers that exhibit two very useful properties: their folded structures can be determined in solution with great precision using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and computational chemistry, and their folding propensities are weak enough to be easily perturbed. These properties make them well suited to progressing from secondary to tertiary structure, a current challenge for foldamers research. In the first strategy, the folding of chains that mix attractive and repulsive interactions within a single molecule will be studied.  By programming folding through the incorporation of pyrazine-2,3-diyl units into the sequence, complex structures will be obtained that are to be used to construct the coil segments necessary for tertiary structure. In the second strategy, cage structures incorporating multiple o-phenylene units will be investigated as simple examples of tertiary structure. Emphasis will be placed on understanding how the folding of the o-phenylenes responds to cage geometry and the inclusion of guest molecules.  This research has the potential to provide access to and understanding of fundamentally new molecular folder systems to build complex non-biological structures with great potential for binding small molecule analytes and the potential for providing a new molecular scaffold for catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to transform a successful mechatronics apprenticeship into a regional engine for growth by convening a Business and Industry Leadership Team to expand the apprenticeship opportunity to encompass community colleges and corporate partners in a four-county area. It will result in a standardized, articulable mechatronics curriculum that will allow apprentices to enter the program in their home county, transfer credits between institutions, and receive on-the-job training that is closely tied to classroom instruction. This will serve as a model for dynamically changing technical apprenticeship programs that serve the needs of an entire region as manufacturing technologies continue to advance.<br/><br/>Specifically, four local community colleges sill work together to adopt the knowledge, skills, and abilities recommended by the business and industry leadership team to create a foundational mechatronics program that serves as the basis of the technical instruction of the apprenticeship program, including standardizing a core set of lab equipment. Roving trainers will align the on-the-job training with classroom instruction using detailed technical lessons adapted from the German dual system of technical education, and a coordinator will align the progress of apprentices as they move between participating community colleges. Participating community colleges will host a series of STEM summer camps to attract a continuous pipeline of students interested in advanced manufacturing to meet the increased demand of this regional apprenticeship program.

This will entail deciphering the nonlinear and high-dimensional relationship between the major senescence signaling pathways (i.e., mTOR, EGF, FGF, PDGF, and insulin). The research team will first utilize AI to identify the combination of pharmacological factors that reduces senescence. Subsequently, transcriptome analyses of the rejuvenated MSCs will be performed to identify how the induced transcriptional response mitigates senescence. By performing a targeted drug screening that perturbs the AI-predicted factor combination, the research team will identify the underlying drug synergism that amplifies the efficacy of the ?combination therapy?.

Although breathing is directly impacted by respiratory disease, conventional respiratory monitoring technologies offer only a brief snapshot of respiratory health in a clinical setting, with a strong reliance on the expertise of healthcare professionals. To improve health outcomes, there is a need for non-invasive tools that facilitate access to respiratory health data, increase the likelihood of early disease detection, improve patient monitoring, and enhance the effectiveness of telemedicine. The proposed technology is expected to benefit healthcare outcomes and ease the economic burdens associated with respiratory disease. Such benefits will likely be felt most strongly in underserved rural, low-income, and minority communities with limited access to specialist care and facilities. If brought to market, this technology also may help support the emerging flexible hybrid electronics manufacturing sector in the US and potentially disrupt the protective facemask industry. <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a wearable platform for respiratory health monitoring.

The smart mask enables the non-invasive acquisition of respiratory data under daily life conditions, providing rich data sets for AI training, testing, and robust pattern identification. The AI capabilities, in turn, elevate the utility of the sensors beyond signal monitoring, to enable autonomous diagnostics for detecting anomalous breathing associated with disease or user distress.   In addition, the proposed platform technology may improve early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sleep apnea, protection and monitoring of vulnerable populations that are sensitive to air pollution caused by forest fires or smog, protection and monitoring of workers in hazardous manufacturing environments, protection and monitoring of populations during viral outbreaks of COVID or flu, remote patient monitoring for telemedicine, and  breath training for rehabilitation and stress relief.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Converting lignin, a largely underutilized yet chemically rich byproduct of the biorefining industry, to valuable aromatic platform chemicals is an energy-intensive process that has made this approach cost prohibitive. Recently, dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells (similar to photovoltaic cells) have emerged as a low-cost and environmentally friendly technology for converting solar energy into chemical fuels or electricity. These photoelectrochemical cells offer a means of using renewable solar energy to drive energy-intensive chemical conversions at ambient temperature and pressure. Here, the collaborative fundamental research project will study how a dye-sensitized photoanode can chemoselectively oxidize lignin with a suitable catalyst as a first step toward a complete light-driven lignin depolymerization process. This approach will expand on the use of heterogeneous catalysis for the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to produce carbonyl or carboxyl compounds for the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. This work represents a new application for dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells, and the research findings from the project will be disseminated to the public through research publications, conference presentations, and by organizing and hosting educational outreach programs for future professionals in the STEM field. The PIs will also actively recruit and support underrepresented minority students through the outreach program.<br/><br/>Organic oxidation reactions are important in organic synthesis or lignocellulosic biomass processing. Chemoselective oxidation of the aliphatic and/or benzylic alcohol moieties in lignin is a good target for controlling the degradation of lignin to generate desired small molecular products. This project aims to elucidate a photoelectrosynthetic chemoselective oxidation of alcohol moieties in lignin by combining the use of aminoxyl mediators with a dye-sensitized photoanode (DSP) at room temperature. Essential to this approach is the use of a dye-sensitized electrode interface to activate a nitroxyl mediator via light-induced charge separation. This presents both a new approach for driving the photochemical oxidation of the secondary benzylic alcohol and the primary aliphatic alcohol functional groups found in lignin, as well as a new photocatalytic application for dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells, which have traditionally focused on solar water splitting. The approach will involve (1) the synthesis of photoactive polymeric catalysts and the elucidation of their underlying photochemical electron transfer properties for activating nitroxyl mediators, (2) the fabrication and evaluation of mesoporous semiconductor-based electrodes specifically designed for the chemoselective oxidation of lignin dimer model compounds with a series of nitroxyl mediators, and (3) the elucidation of mechanistic pathways for the light-driven oxidation of 2o benzylic and 1o aliphatic alcohols using a DSP and address practical challenges presented by the use of oligomer model compounds and technical lignin.

Propagating quantum states of light through current optical communication networks or future SDM systems can fulfill this demand and meet the essential consumer requirements for secure communication. The overarching aim of this research is to advance this objective through the Production and transmission of entangled photons over optical fibers. In the past, entangled photon pairs were created using bulk periodically poled crystals and waveguides utilizing their second-order nonlinearity. However, this method results in additional loss from fiber coupling and suffers from low photon yield at telecommunication bandwidths. The generation and transmission of entangled photons through optical fibers are desirable for a variety of applications. Nevertheless, the current approaches pose several challenges, including complexity, limited data generation, reliance on bulky and high-powered pulsed lasers, and the introduction of quantum noise. This study proposes the utilization of various modes of few-mode and multimode fibers to produce a pair of entangled photons, which will provide improved control over entanglement properties and better integration with SDM systems. This approach is expected to alleviate the challenges mentioned earlier. As part of the research and education integration, a graduate student working on this project will receive training in nonlinear fiber optics and quantum laser sources. Furthermore, undergraduate students will have the opportunity to participate in various stages of the project through research credits and summer internships in order to spark their interest in fiber-optic research at Missouri S&T, which is a minority-serving university.<br/><br/>The proposed research aims to investigate the impact of intermodal nonlinearities on quantum entanglement in few-mode and multimode fibers. This project is both significant and innovative in that it will employ intermodal nonlinearities to generate and transmit quantum channels across various spatial modes within such fibers. By employing pumps in two different modes of the fiber, spontaneous four-wave mixing nonlinear effect generates an entangled photon pair each of which are in a different spatial mode traveling in different channels. The project seeks to establish theoretical and experimental platforms to investigate the underlying mechanisms of such intermodal entangled mode generation. These platforms will be utilized to examine the basic processes of such intermodal entanglement in fibers. Subsequent quantum correlation experiments will be performed to characterize the generated photon pairs quantum states. By directly generating entangled photon pairs in fiber, the coupling loss will be eliminated and by the choice of fiber and the pump wavelengths, the Raman scattering noise can be avoided. The primary objective is to improve quantum communication over fiber by utilizing intermodal quantum entanglement in few-mode and multimode fibers and could have a transformative impact on quantum communication and sensing utilizing SDM-compatible fibers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the bacterial predator to be investigated with this award, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (Bb), is known to degrade microbial biofilms, including antibiotic resistant ones, plays a role in wastewater treatment, and shows potential to curb infections in animals and plants, earning it the title of ?living antibiotic?. Understanding both Bb?s hunting strategy and life cycle are prerequisites toward exploiting Bb as a biocontrol agent. What is more, the ability to leverage bacteria as antibiotics has clear advantages as compared to small molecule antibiotics as bacterial predators provide us with many more tunable knobs to help potentially activate, modulate, or turn off their hunting at will.<br/><br/>In recent work, the investigators explored how Bb use fluid motion around themselves as they propel through their fluid environments to passively push themselves towards surfaces where their prey, such as the bacterial species E. coli, are in abundance. This motion in search for its prey requires the predator to expend energy and begs the following four questions: <br/><br/> 1) How do Bb use cues from their surroundings to determine whether it is worth expending their limited resources to swim in order to locate prey? <br/> 2) Under starvation conditions and other extreme environments, how do Bb, depending on chance encounters with their prey to replicate, adapt their speed to efficiently locate their prey?  In other words, do they swim at constant speed or alternate between rapid and slow motion to explore their environment while preserving their energy resources as much as possible? <br/> 3) How does confining Bb in tight environments (as would be the case if Bb were hunting in a crevasse or a crack characteristic of the environments they live in) amplify the fluctuations in the levels of predator? In other words, can we maintain a steady population of Bb in an environment if we eventually use Bb as a biocontrol agent downstream or will their populations always undergo major variations?<br/> 4) How can we determine the rate at which these bacterial predators hunt in environments (such as within living animals) where we cannot see them? In other words, how can we monitor their predation efficiency when we cannot use microscopes to observe Bb hunting for prey as Bb may be hunting too deep within a sample in regions inaccessible to microscopes? <br/><br/>Put together, answers to these questions form the basis of this award's goals. The longer term national interest of this work is therefore the ability to tune bacterial predators poised to become resilient, and adaptable, tools in wastewater treatment, the fight against harmful bacteria, both natural and introduced by terrorist threat, as well as to degrade microbial biofilms.  <br/><br/>This award will also contribute to STEM education. In Arizona, minority students overwhelmingly begin their academic path by attending community and other public colleges which are ?70% minority. While minority students are slightly more interested in STEM fields than their white peers, this interest doesn?t translate into college graduation in STEM. To help ASU?s large incoming community college demographic acclimate to STEM, we propose a two-week Summer Data Analysis Program (SDAP). SDAP will cover a broad range of topics on the treatment of data and uncertainty and is directly inspired by the data-driven efforts of this project. Student attendees of SDAP will be recruited from programs already aimed at integrating community college recruits and other minority students into the university community (such as ASU?s SUNDIAL Program and IDEAs program). Students will be offered a full stipend over the 2 week bootcamp to help reduce economic disincentives associated with cutting back on summer work to attend SDAP. Each day in SDAP will consist of two parts: mornings will include a 2-3 hr tutorial followed by assigned computational projects (on laptops provided by the PI). ASU?s College Research and Evaluation Services Team (CREST) will help evaluate both short and long term impact of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physical or chemical phenomena occurring in extremely small distances (less than one micrometer) for extremely short time durations (less than one nanosecond) can be analyzed and understood with such advanced nanofabrication tools and methodologies. Superfluorescence (SF), collective light generations from an ensemble of interacting emitters in a nanometer-sized dimension, is one of the fascinating quantum phenomena. SF occurs when the light emitters synchronously behave under a single-mode electromagnetic field as they generate intensive short pulses. As a new type of bright light source, SF may find rich applications in quantum sensing, ultranarrow laser, and photonic-based quantum computation. The realization of SF, however, is challenging because it usually requires very low temperatures and stringent excitation conditions. This project uses a low-dimensional compound semiconductor called quasi-two-dimensional (2D) perovskites in thin film form. Indeed, a room-temperature SF has been observed in quasi-2D perovskite thin films, demonstrating that a room-temperature SF is feasible, but still, the quantum-optical properties of this SF akin to traditional SFs of gaseous phases have yet to be explored. Because of the potential inherent in a room temperature SF, it is of pressing importance that SFs from solid-state quasi-2D perovskites are refined and their exquisite quantum states measured. The proposed work will advance our understanding of the collective optical effects from a robust solid-state material and show the practical way to engineer and control the output properties of the quantum lights. <br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop optical devices that control SF-lasing phase transitions by incorporating quasi-2D perovskite onto distributed feedback (DFB) resonators. Engineering monolithic resonant cavities with quasi-2D perovskites will provide optical controllability over the phase diagrams of SF-lasing transitions. Besides reproducing the existing results, the proposed project will perform (1) time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy on a femtosecond time scale to examine the dynamical characteristics of the SF emission from quasi-2D perovskite DFB resonators. This experiment will measure the SF build-up time required for the phase-synchronization of interacting emitters and the characteristic Rabi-type oscillations of photoluminescence decay curves, implying a strong light-matter coupling. Moreover, this project will perform (2) measurements of wavelength-dependent second-order correlation functions that will reveal the photon statistics and bunching characteristics of SFs. Finally, using homodyne detection tomography, the research team will (3) search for their non-classical photon states, such as displaced squeezed states. The pulsed and quantum nature of SF at room temperature may open a route toward realizing an ultrafast quantum light source. Photonic device fabrication and femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy are the major experimental tasks of the project, which will also allow the exploitation of other emerging photoluminescent materials beyond perovskites. In addition, this project involves the development of a quantum optics lab course at Michigan Tech.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many instances, like in the case of chemical reactions, these structures emerge from the interaction of two competing processes that lead to an instability. Roughly, the first mechanism relates to the intrinsic behavior of the system, while the second one corresponds to a transport, or diffusion process. While in most cases diffusion is the correct mechanism to consider, in many biological applications it does not capture the observed behavior. This is particularly true when modeling dispersion of populations or plant seeds, or when looking at hunting or foraging behavior of certain animals. In this project, the investigator studies how these nonlocal forms of dispersal affect pattern formation in physical and biological applications. The main motivation comes from arid ecosystems, which are known to exhibit patterns of banded vegetation. While most mathematical models use diffusion to represent dispersal of plant seeds, numerical experiments suggest that these equations, although more tractable, ignore critical information. For example, the analysis of these 'local' models shows that changes in the spacing between bands of vegetation due to reduced rainfall often signal a possible irreversible transition to a fully desert state. However, when nonlocal seed dispersal is considered, simulations indicate that the resilience of these ecosystems with respect to such changes is increased. The discrepancy between these two models highlights the need for more in-depth studies of long-range dispersal effects. To study these effects, a nonlocal Gray-Scott model will be used as a test case. This specific set of equations also provides a basis for interesting projects for graduate students and for summer research experiences for undergraduates. <br/><br/><br/>Because nonlocal processes are often modeled using convolution operators, the main obstacle for studying these systems comes from the limited set of mathematical and numerical tools available to analyze these maps. Indeed, most studies represent these operators using convolution kernels that have properties which facilitate their analysis. At the same time, numerical simulations often ignore the fact that convolution maps require information about the unknown outside the computational domain, and thus incorrectly implement boundary constraints. One of the project's goals is to provide methods for proving Fredholm properties for these maps by choosing as their domain a specific class of functions with algebraic decay. This work allows investigators to use the implicit function theorem to prove the existence of patterns. Since the class of functions being considered also provides information about the level of decay of solutions at infinity, this information can then be used to construct numerical schemes with appropriate boundary constraints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study where energy is used as an organ grows and develops. This will be accomplished by imaging the energy in growing organs and then using physics to predict the growth and development of that organ, thus establishing a ?Rule of life.? Such a rule could have far-reaching implications for studying organs, and this work will provide a new perspective for understanding organ development. The organ this study focuses on will be the lung. Broader impacts will include outreach to young scientists through an annual 8 week summer program through Princeton University (The Princeton Learning Laboratory) designed for high school students, as well as training of undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project explores the hypothesis that the physical forces driving tissue development are proportional to the local rate of energy production. Measurements in early embryonic chicken and mouse lung explants will connect patterns of chemical-energy turnover to mesoscopic tissue morphogenesis. The project will (1) use fluorescence microscopy of lung explants to measure spatial variations of energy metabolism, (2) measure the mechanical properties of the tissue layers in the lung explants, and (3) model the growth of the lung from the perspective of active matter physics, with a driving force locally proportional to the rate of energy production. The embryonic lung was chosen as a model organ because the morphology is distinct and stereotyped within a species, easily imaged in real-time, and prior work has characterized the morphogenesis of lung explants. Lungs collected from chicken eggs will make this research easily accessible for young scientists. Training programs incorporated into this project include a high school student summer program and subprojects for university students. These experiments and models will be some of the first work toward understanding energetics in organogenesis. The spatial quantification of energy metabolism and material properties generated by this work will provide a testbed for physical theories that relate cellular energetics to tissue generation from the molecular level, up the hierarchical structure of the developing lung, to the whole-organ scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The properties of all solids are determined by the elements that comprise them and their arrangement. Even a simple combination of two elements, like iron sulfide, can produce as many as nine different crystal formations with vastly different chemical and magnetic behavior, conductivity, color, other properties, and potential uses. This complexity makes crystalline science incredibly intriguing.  The knowledge to be gained from this research project is expected to help in the discovery of conditions to produce individual nanocrystal types in pure form.  Focusing research on nanocrystalline inorganic materials could ultimately unleash potentially disruptive technologies as this size of crystal generally has a great potential for applications in solar cells, batteries, medical magnetic imaging, semiconductors, and novel catalysts. One outreach activity of the project, involves using the knowledge gained on iron chemistry to rediscover long-lost methods for preparing ancient rock art of the Anishinaabe.  In addition, this project will provide a rigorous research training for graduate and undergraduate students to help build the future workforce in science.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Macdonald and her team will perform a wide, sweeping, and systematic study of the phase-controlled synthesis. Manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper chalcogenides (sulfides, selenides and tellurides) be examined in particular because they have particularly complex phase diagrams. Libraries of organochalcogenides will be employed to separate the role of the kinetic rate from the decomposition mechanism of the precursors in phase determination. Maps will be drawn of the phase landscape that will provide guidance for targeted synthetic changes to achieve one phase over another.  The second aim strives to resolve a long-standing debate about how polytypes are controlled in nanocrystal synthesis. Tools gleaned from molecular coordination chemistry will be employed with the goal of achieving polymorphic phase control more broadly across the periodic table to target ""ghost phases"" that have been predicted but never seen.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing text-based privacy policies are hard to read and make sense of, making it hard for people to understand what a mobile app will do with their data. This has led major app stores to require apps to use standardized ?privacy labels??akin to nutrition labels?to help people make informed choices about the apps they use; however, it is unclear how well these labels work in the real world. This project will attack this question by studying how privacy labels work for three main groups: app developers who must select correct labels for their apps; app store administrators that create the policies and standards for the labels; and end users who must use them to make privacy decisions. The team will also analyze mobile apps to see how well they adhere to the promises made by their privacy labels, and how both people?s understandings of privacy labels and apps? adherence to them changes over time. Together the work will lead to better understanding, design, and use of privacy labels for both regulators and people who use mobile apps.<br/> <br/>To address these questions, the project will apply a mixed-methods approach. For studying end users, the research team will perform iterative usability testing and longitudinal comprehension studies to gauge understanding of these new privacy labels and how it changes over time. The team will also use factorial vignettes analyzed by multivariate regressions to identify factors of both existing and hypothetical privacy label designs that might impact user decision making around installing, using, and granting permissions to apps. For studying developers and platforms, the team will conduct quantitative measurement studies using a ?privacy label observatory? that will periodically collect a number of versions of both apps and their privacy labels, using dynamic software analysis of the apps to determine their use of private information. This will help answer questions about whether privacy labels become more accurate over time as developers become more familiar with them, as well as how the app ecosystem reacts to events like regulatory or company policy changes and enforcement actions. The primary outcomes of this project will be empirical data on whether these new privacy tools are working, how and why they might be failing both app developers and consumers alike, and how platforms can improve their design to make them more effective.

The goal of this research is to design new photoactive iron complexes with sulfoxide ligands. The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry, and is appropriate for education of scientists at all levels of experience. The University of New Mexico is a majority minority institution and the Rack research group is works to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science and will continue to do so under this award.

The goal of this work is to discover if phototriggered sulfoxide isomerization can be supported on iron centers in a fashion similar to that on related ruthenium complexes. In ruthenium complexes, 3MLCT excitation prompts transient Ru3+ formation, which induces excited state isomerization of the sulfoxide from S-bonded to O-bonded. Professor Rack and his research team aim to reproduce this photochemistry on iron with the objective of stabilizing high or intermediate spin states with the O-bonded coordination mode. There are two major challenges that must be met to observe this chemistry on iron:  3MCLT (metal-to-ligand charge-transfer) states on iron are rare due to the primogenic effect and sulfoxide isomerization on iron has not been reported. Preliminary results provide  evidence that these challenges can be overcome and that the goal of achieving S- to O-sulfoxide bonding on iron can be achieved.  If successful, the ability to achieve such intermediate to high spin state Fe-sulfoxide complexes would be a significant advance for the field as this would bring this chemistry into the realm of earth abundant transition metal space, and open up an important new avenue of exploration for organometallic chemists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main objective of the project is to develop a cohesive system of support for middle and high school PSTs to become CMTs. The objective will be achieved by supporting PSTs in their methods courses and their fieldwork. Support in fieldwork will be provided in collaboration with cooperating teachers and university supervisors through extended professional development focused on critical mathematics education, including supporting PSTs in creating lessons relevant to students' lives and introducing the cultural and historical origins of mathematical ideas. This project is supported by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12), which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Autonomous engineering systems, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial robots, are emerging engineering systems that are replacing humans in many aspects of society. It is envisioned that AES in the future should have the capability of not only autonomously accomplishing a mission, but also proactively preventing failures in operation (i.e., active failure prevention). Through simulation-based design under uncertainty, this research will incorporate post-design active failure prevention into the early design stage of AES, thus reducing the probability of failure when the designed AES is put into operation. The research will establish a theoretical foundation that enables: (1) efficient and accurate analysis of the reliability of AES equipped with active failure prevention in the presence of uncertainty; and (2) co-design of AES physical and cyber systems for active failure prevention subject to specific reliability requirements. This research will enable the design of AES with assured reliability. It will accelerate the development of AES by reducing the reliability certification effort in the design process. Additional deliverables of this project include improvement of reliability and design-related curricula, research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach initiatives for students and under-represented minorities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to create a new design paradigm shift from the conventional reliability-based design of engineered systems through passive reliability assurance to the model-based design of reliable AES to account for both passive reliability assurance at the population level and active failure prevention at the individual level. Personalized active failure prevention and autonomy set AES apart from conventional engineered systems and make current design under uncertainty methodologies inapplicable to AES. The research draws upon model-based design, statistics, machine learning, and optimization to fill the gap in the current methods. It will create innovations in reliability analysis by tackling the computational challenges through a first-passage method and co-simulations, while accounting for active failure prevention, along with innovations in design optimization by decoupling and decentralizing reliability-based co-design problems. The research has broad societal impacts by enabling the design of AES with active failure prevention with the consideration of reliability, which accelerates the development of next-generation reliable autonomous engineering systems to replace humans in safety-critical or dangerous mission/working environments.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This fellowship aims to study patterns of distribution of living organisms across tropical and polar latitudes. Prior studies of the distributions of species show that the diversity of living organisms tends to decrease with distance from the equator. Even though this pattern is global and has been known since the days of Charles Darwin, we still do not know what causes this trend. This research will explore how the distinct diversity of living organisms across latitudes arose by comparing species formation in tropical, temperate, and polar environments. By discovering regions where species are more likely to originate, the fellow will work to uncover the history and distribution of biodiversity across the planet. A more complete understanding of how biodiversity operates across geographic scales will contribute to our ability to mitigate invasive species, diseases and their vectors, and the costs of climate change. Research activities will be accompanied by several education and outreach efforts directed at incarcerated and formerly-incarcerated populations in the Nashville area.<br/><br/>This project will explore the latitudinal diversity gradient by conducting a series of large-scale diversification studies. Due to the breadth of sampling required to estimate global diversification, current studies are largely limited to densely sampled groups in vertebrates and vascular plants. This limits the scope of our understanding both phylogenetically and geographically, as these groups are largely restricted to tropical and temperate climes. To address these knowledge gaps, this research will generate global diversification gradients in a previously unexplored kingdom (Fungi) and two marine invertebrate clades (Polynoidae and Pycnogonida) with circumpolar distributions. Diversification gradients will be inferred through a combination of methods explicitly designed to accommodate concerns recently raised over the ability of diversification analyses to distinguish between hypotheses. These include nonparametric approaches, hidden state speciation extinction models, and new methods incorporating diversity-dependence and paleogeographic shifts. The work will also be integrated into multiple broader impact efforts, including the Evolutionary Studies Initiative and Maximizing Access to Research Careers programs at Vanderbilt University, as well as develop new outreach and engagement materials geared toward prison education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

No, far from it. In fact, the precise pattern of DNA folding is very important for how genes, which are scattered all across chromosomes, can function. For example, in addition to genes, chromosomes harbor a constellation of elements called ?enhancers? that boost the activity of genes packaged with them in the nucleus. Thus, if chromosome folding brings a given gene together with an enhancer, the gene will be more active; whereas if they are separated, the gene will be less active. This project will establish novel tools based on the cohesin protein complex to artificially manipulate chromosome folding and modulate various genome functions ? including enhancer regulation of gene expression. Such technologies can enable unprecedented control over chromosome structure and function, opening new avenues for both fundamental research as well as  genome and epigenome engineering. Broader impacts of this project include multi-disciplinary research training opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>Cohesin catalyzes DNA loop extrusion, which is central to the proper folding of chromosomes. This project will create tools to either force or disable cohesin-mediated looping at any desired genomic location and effectively enable re-folding of chromosomes in a designer fashion. The resulting technology will be used to explore novel ways to modulate, supplant or bypass how enhancers regulate genes. For example, control of DNA looping could be the basis of future strategies to prevent genes involved in cancer from being activated by neighboring enhancers in tumor cells. Gaining the ability to rewire the genome and control the many processes that rely on genome architecture holds promise for synthetic biology, biomedicine, and other research areas that advance biotechnology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will create, characterize, simulate, and test how atoms of distinct metals move and facilitate reactions upon the surfaces of nanoparticles comprised primarily of gold with small amounts (1-5%) of a second element such as palladium or platinum. These materials are commonly described as single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts. These materials offer high rates and selectivities for numerous reactions important for domestic production of energy carriers and platform chemicals (e.g., valorization of biomass, shale gas, operation of fuel cells and electrolyzers). SAA currently suffer from a distressingly low number of active sites per gram of precious metal used. The collaborative team aims to develop methods to create SAA nanoparticles with smaller diameters (< 2 nm) to remedy this problem, and then test if the emergent and beneficial catalytic properties of these SAA are preserved as the size of the nanoparticles decreases. Here, the team will combine cutting-edge methods in quantum chemical simulations and multiscale modeling, characterization of operating catalysts using synchrotron methods, and catalyst testing and spectroscopy to learn how the nanoparticles restructure in different combinations of reactive gases relevant for catalysis (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide). Subsequently, the team will assess how rates and selectivities for a testbed reaction (reduction of oxygen with hydrogen) depend on the spatial organization of the atoms on the nanoparticle surface. Methods that will be developed will be useful for other dynamic catalyst systems and will be integrated into graduate-level courses. The proposed work involves lab-based education of graduate and undergraduate students and focused efforts to increase participation of women in catalysis science, especially with NSF REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) opportunities and cross-training of researchers across the three partnering institutions.<br/><br/>Under this award, the collaborative Flaherty/Hibbitts/Karim team aims to learn how the structure, dynamics, and catalytic properties of bimetallic and SAA materials depend upon mean particle diameters, composition, and support identity, all factors that impact the coordinative saturation of surface atoms and the identity of their nearest and next-nearest neighbor atoms. The team will couple precise synthesis, advanced characterization techniques (including n situ, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, microcalorimetry, infrared spectroscopy), and computational methods (simulations of full nanoparticles with density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo) to address the complexity and dynamics of SAA catalysts. A testbed reaction system with rates and selectivities proven to be structure-sensitive with respect to these materials (H2 + O2 ? H2O2) will be used to probe the surface structures of active catalysts, a challenge as the high pressures and complex solvents used often render characterization difficult. First, Au-rich bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (i.e., M1Aux materials, where M = Pd, Pt, Rh) with mean diameters of 1-2, ~6 and ~10 nm will be created, their post-synthesis structures will be characterized, and then the influence of adsorption and reactions on their structures will be examined over extended periods.  Second, the thermodynamic relationships among adsorption energies, active site motifs, and nanoparticle structure will be determined. Third, the fundamental connections surrounding  elemental identity, mole fraction, and coordination of the reactive metal and reaction rates, selectivities and barriers for H2O2 and H2O formation will be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The automated system for carbon tracking and visualization that this project is evolving could allow it to network many organizations that are trying to pursue carbon reduction activities on a verifiable map, coordinating otherwise disparate efforts. Regional, national, and global coordination are important as the world attempts to solve the global climate change problem. The proposed platform not only envisions aggregate multisector information on the global level, it allows for collaboration among organizations by sharing carbon goals and decarbonization investments through carbon easements or credits.  The solution also contextualizes carbon footprints on the entity or region-level within the planetary carbon usage and planetary carbon boundaries. This visualization tool used for coordination is expected to help accelerate public-private partnerships in the sustainability space, and help organizations collaborate around resource management, and support economic activities and job creation through connectivity. <br/><br/>The technical innovation in this research is the visual coordination of all the simultaneous, multi-level, decarbonization efforts onto one map. Regional coordination remains one of the biggest obstacles to widespread climate action. Even when a county-level climate action plan is pursued, cities within the counties may not implement goals evenly, as there are often inequities in resource distribution. Similarly, there is often a lack of coordination within industries; Companies may have trouble mapping scope data, let alone collaborating with other industries. The project is likely to make collaborations more accessible for companies and governments by visualizing potential partners? goals and trajectories publicly. Companies that provide verified footprints may have advantages of more thorough data, more accurate data, and recommendations offered to them. In this research, the team intends to pursue the development of a carbon negative budget for users, map out past and future carbon usage, automate emissions data uploads, build out maps for internal facilities or assets of a user, and build out a decarbonization model tool for users to explore solution scenarios enabling tokenized on-platform carbon trading.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new reaction monitoring systems have provided new avenues to explore organolithium (Thrust I) and ozonide (Thrust II) intermediates. The ability to investigate the fundamental reactivity patterns of various systems is providing new and, at times, unexpected mechanistic insights to be obtained, allowing for new reactions to be developed. The newly found mechanistic data are being applied to answer several open synthetic challenges that have considerable importance to the field. Specifically, Thrust I is focused on exploring how chiral Lewis bases can create new avenues for the asymmetric construction of carbon-carbon bonds with organolithium reagents; and Thrust II is developing new oxygenation reactions with ozone by exploring the reactivity patterns of primary ozonides. In addition, this program is well suited to impart a broad set of skills to students as the research requires extensive training in organic synthesis, kinetic analysis, and advanced spectroscopic techniques such as rapid-injection NMR spectroscopy. The crux of the research program has been integrated into an education plan that seeks to expand the scientific literacy of all citizens and places a special emphasis on engaging low-income areas. A chemistry workshop has been established to expose 3rd , 4th, and 5th graders to chemistry early on and inspire them to seek careers in STEM. <br/><br/>By using unique RI-NMR reaction monitoring systems, this project is focused on the following two objectives: (Thrust I) development of new asymmetric deprotonation substitution sequences with separated ion pairs and (Thrust II) development of asymmetric constructive ozonolysis for carbon-oxygen bond formation. In Thrust I, a variety of chiral Lewis bases will be synthesized and investigated for the asymmetric capture of carbanions. Specifically, the proposed work endeavors to elucidate the key structural features of chiral Lewis bases and organometallic reagents that engender essential activating and controlling functions for the development of highly general and selective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. Thrust II of this proposal seeks to gain a detailed mechanistic understanding of the steric and electronic control elements that influence the formation of primary ozonides and their subsequent diversification. Specifically, Thrust II addresses the long-standing synthetic challenge of functionalizing oxygen after it is installed into a carbon skeleton ? pursuing new modes for alkyl ether formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, online retailers must decide how to distribute their available inventory among geographically distributed warehouses, influencing individual order fulfillment decisions. In current practice the resource allocation decisions do not consider the nature of the operational decisions, which can result in significant losses in efficiency. This research project will contribute to the economic welfare of the nation by developing a general strategy for these problems that can be customized to different problem settings, providing a context-independent coordination mechanism that can be applied to many industries. The educational and outreach activities will involve students in hands-on optimization projects, create new education programs in datacentric decision-making, and address the food deserts problem in urban areas by viewing the problem from the lens of coordinating resource allocation decisions with real-time operations.<br/><br/>The current state of knowledge does not provide efficient algorithms for coordinating tactical resource allocation decisions with the operational decisions that use those resources. There are two main reasons for this gap: computing the optimal operational policy often requires solving a high-dimensional dynamic program, and the optimal value functions may lack structure, providing no clear basis for resource allocation decisions. This project will build a general approximation framework for coordination that is independent of the application setting. The framework uses surrogate functions to develop an upper bound on the performance of the optimal operational policy and a lower bound on that of an approximate operational policy. Bounding the relative gap between the two surrogates will yield a performance guarantee for the coordination problem. Selection of appropriate surrogate functions will allow application of the approximation framework to different applications, providing efficient approximate solutions with provable performance guarantees. To achieve such solutions, ideas from combinatorial and dynamic optimization, as well as discrete choice and price response modeling will be combined. The resulting algorithms will be tested on several publicly available datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It analyzes how differences in which individuals produce offspring and how many offspring they produce lead to population-wide changes in behavior or morphology. In natural populations, some individuals are often more successful than others at producing offspring. This is especially true in ?lek? mating species, where males display to many females in one location, and females visit many males before mating. Iconic examples of such behavior occur in peacocks, birds-of-paradise, and small tropical birds called manakins. This project builds on long-term monitoring of behavior in the lance-tailed manakin to investigate patterns of individual reproductive success. By following the fate of individual manakins and linking individual behavior and other traits to genetically measured reproductive success, researchers will measure the strength of both natural and sexual selection in a wild population. Broader impacts of this work include intensive independent research opportunities for undergraduate students, internationally and on the university campus. A collaboration hosts a live stream of manakin display activity with supporting in-depth and accurate content about evolution and behavior. The work produces training opportunities for post-graduates and graduate students, who will take part in data collection and outreach.<br/><br/>This project advances three key areas of research in evolution and animal behavior. First, it characterizes temporal variation in the potential for sexual selection to occur (measured as standardized reproductive variance). To do so, the work investigates three hypothesized sources of this variation: breeding synchrony, climactic variation, and variation in the availability of preferred mates. Second, it draws on strengths of the long-term dataset to incorporate changes that occur across individual lifespans into analyses of sexual selection. This allows for the separation of developmental from selective processes to more accurately characterize targets of selection. Long-term data include video of displays by the same males across their breeding tenure, and these will be analyzed to objectively measure changes in display performance over time. Finally, this study directly quantifies genetic changes in the population over time. These data will be used to assess the relative contribution of multiple sources of evolutionary change, including viability selection, gene flow, and drift as well as sexual selection. Samples archived during this study build potential for later genomic analysis to understand the genes underlying sexual selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This tradeoff happens all the time in everyday life - do we ?exploit? what we already know, or ?explore? something new and unfamiliar? Do we choose to go to our favorite restaurant (exploitation) or try out a new restaurant (exploration)? Other examples include deciding where to go for vacation, which friends to talk to at a party, or what foods to order at the restaurant. While exploring new places, new friends, new foods is key to figuring out what we like and can lead to the formation of new preferences, it comes at the cost of foregoing the immediate value of familiar options. This project seeks to understand how the decision to explore or exploit takes shape in the human brain. <br/><br/>In order to understand the neural basis of decision making, two non-invasive, complementary neuroimaging techniques can be used to analyze brain activity while people make the decision to explore or exploit. One approach (fMRI or functional magnetic resonance imaging) has superb spatial resolution, and can tell where brain activity is localized during decision-making. Another approach (MEG or magnoencephalography) has excellent temporal resolution and can pinpoint precisely when brain signals occur while people make explore-exploit decisions. Relatively little is known about the timing of these decisions in the brain. Utilizing these neuroimaging techniques, experiments measure the spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity in situations where people are trying to gain as many profits as possible, as well as in contrasting situations where people are trying to avoid losses. This will allow an experimental test of the hypothesis that the brain circuits involved when people are trying to maximize profits through explore-exploit decisions are distinct from the circuits involved when they are trying to minimize losses. Using computational modeling, the project will also study the accuracy of decoding exploration and exploitation decisions from MEG brain data under different conditions and at different points in a decision trial. Additional research will use a technique (TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation) for safely stimulating the brain to provide a ?cause-and-effect? test of predictions about how the brain controls explore-exploit decisions. How the human brain chooses between familiarity and novelty during decision-making is a long-standing mystery in human brain and decision sciences, and this research project is likely to greatly increase our knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying decision making. These studies will also have significant societal implications in educational and clinical settings and in a broad array of contexts where insights from neuroscience may encourage and help people to make better choices. The scientific research in this project will be accompanied by an outreach program to an under-represented community to teach computer programming and STEM skills to high school students, and introduce them to the excitement of neuroscience research.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cognitive Neuroscience Program in SBE, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has led major app stores to require apps to use standardized ?privacy labels??akin to nutrition labels?to help people make informed choices about the apps they use; however, it is unclear how well these labels work in the real world. This project will attack this question by studying how privacy labels work for three main groups: app developers who must select correct labels for their apps; app store administrators that create the policies and standards for the labels; and end users who must use them to make privacy decisions. The team will also analyze mobile apps to see how well they adhere to the promises made by their privacy labels, and how both people?s understandings of privacy labels and apps? adherence to them changes over time. Together the work will lead to better understanding, design, and use of privacy labels for both regulators and people who use mobile apps.<br/> <br/>To address these questions, the project will apply a mixed-methods approach.

This doctoral dissertation project investigates the meaning of a particular class of discourse particles known as additives, which include English 'too', 'either', 'also', and 'as well'. An additive signals that the sentence it occurs in augments another piece of information. For example, a speaker who utters, 'I like pizza. I like spaghetti too,' conveys that the sentences 'I like pizza' and 'I like spaghetti' both contribute to the discourse goal of determining what foods the speaker likes. This project uses data from corpora of naturally-occurring English texts and large-scale web-based experiments to understand how English additives link pieces of information in discourse. By consulting with native speakers of four additional languages, the project also aims to identify ways in which additives perform similar functions across languages as well as ways in which they vary across languages. In addition to facilitating the exchange of information to achieve shared discourse goals, additives also convey social meaning ? that is, information about a speaker?s social identity. A particularly salient social effect arises when the additive particle 'too' is used to express disagreement. For example, if a parent says, 'You didn?t do your homework' to a child, the child might respond, 'I did too!' This use of 'too', which has been called the 'refutational use', is only appropriate in informal contexts and tends to make the speaker sound childish. This project seeks to characterize the social meanings that various additives convey and understand how their social meanings might be related to their semantics. Results of this project are shared with the public through an outreach activity at the Center of Science and Industry (COSI), a local science museum in Columbus, Ohio. This outreach introduces members of the public of all ages to key concepts in semantics and sociolinguistics, contributing to science education and raising the visibility of linguistics as a field.<br/><br/>Using the tools of formal semantics and pragmatics, this doctoral dissertation project analyzes the meaning of additive expressions in terms of how they shape the structure of discourse. This involves precisely specifying what relationship must hold between an additive?s host sentence and the previously salient piece of information that it augments (called its 'antecedent'). In other words, in what way must two pieces of information be related in order for a speaker to signal that one is offered 'in addition to' the other? The analysis also explains how the meaning of some additive particles could have been extended over time to give rise to the refutational use, whose meaning has not been rigorously studied in previous research. To better understand their meaning, a large-scale web-based experiment is conducted to investigate the precise range of contexts for the refutational uses. To determine the extent to which the analysis of English additives can be extended to other languages and to identify dimensions along which additives vary between languages, native speakers of four additional languages are consulted. One product of this cross-linguistic investigation is a questionnaire that other researchers can use with consultants in the field to study the additive inventories of other languages beyond those studied in this project. To study the social meaning of both the refutational and the additive uses of additive expressions, two large-scale experiments are also conducted measuring the social inferences that listeners draw from the use of such expressions in various contexts. Using those data, the project investigates how differences between the social meanings of the additive and refutational uses might be rooted in semantic differences. This advances interdisciplinarity by bringing the formal rigor of semantics together with insights from anthropology and sociology that are foundational to sociolinguistics. In sum, this dissertation undertakes a holistic investigation of the meaning of additive particles, encompassing semantic, pragmatic, and social dimensions of meaning and employing both formal and experimental methods. The results of this investigation sheds light on how speakers regulate the flow of information in discourse and on the interplay between semantics and social meaning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Backhaul is the network link that moves massive data streams at high speed between two points, supporting large subnetworks of mobile and fixed-location users.  Normally optical fibers carry backhaul data, but fiber deployment is not always viable; wireless backhaul provides the high-speed alternative and solution.  6G will be the first generation of widely deployed wireless communication that has data rates comparable to fiber optics, heralding important benefits to our nation and society.  Rural and remote populations may especially benefit from wireless backhaul, since it supports broadband connectivity (helping to close the digital divide) where fiber deployment is cost prohibitive. Wireless backhaul would also enable temporary high-speed networks critical to operations in mobile military units, natural disaster recoveries, or seasonal endeavors, such as smart and connected farming.  Even the fiber-dominated networks in urban centers may economically and logistically benefit from the high flexibility and relatively low installation cost of wireless backhaul segments.  Further, 6G wireless backhaul will strategically leverage the long-underutilized terahertz spectrum between 0.1-10 THz. Realizing ubiquitous 6G networks will require much new research, but terahertz backhaul is an important first step.  The proposed work will utilize a combination of unique experimental measurements, theoretical models, and new device designs to fill knowledge gaps in the understanding of terahertz backhaul performance under real-world conditions.  The knowledge gained will establish the critical foundations upon which future 6G systems can be intelligently engineered and optimized.  Moreover, this work will train a new generation of students, from high school to graduate levels, inspired to work in electrical engineering and capable of advancing the highly complex wireless communications and sensing technologies in the future.<br/><br/>To date, experimental demonstrations of terahertz communication are still very rare, leaving numerous scientific gaps in the holistic understanding of the impact of the atmosphere, antenna pointing, weather, and turbulence, especially when employing the backhaul requirements of ultrawide bandwidth and long distance.  This dearth of measurements further leads to an inability to properly validate comprehensive theoretical models used in system engineering.  The project goals and scope involve three thrusts: 1. to measure real terahertz backhaul links and enable gap issues to be studied and properly understood;  2. to use experimental measurements as the validation standard upon which theoretical channel models can be corrected and made more comprehensive;  3. to develop multi-functional reflectarrays, which are devices that can actively correct ? in situ ? terahertz communication problems such as antenna pointing, turbulence, and beam distortion.  The measurement method will rely on a unique NSF-funded suite of terahertz systems that are purposely built to enable sensitive, long-distance, ultrawide bandwidth operations, both indoors and outdoors.  The theoretical modeling will be extended to account for backhaul-unique properties, such as ultrawide bandwidth, and to unify the various physical mechanisms into a single comprehensive tool by which backhaul system behavior can be predicted in any practical circumstance.

This new generation of systems will be radically more responsive to learner needs, behaviors, and development and be designed to support the whole learner, beyond discipline-focused achievement. Use-inspired research focuses on computer science education, examining how students learn programming concepts, how they persist through challenging coding tasks, and how generative AI can provide scaffolding support while teachers promote noncognitive skill development. The resultant AI-based tools will be integrated into classrooms to empower teachers to support learners in more developmentally appropriate ways.<br/><br/>This work will generate rich datasets documenting learners' interactions with educational technologies, programming environments, and teachers, allowing researchers to study learner growth over time and across different computer science learning activities. Research draws from partnerships with middle school computer science programs and utilizes platforms including block-based coding and pedagogical agent systems. Research and outreach activities leverage the INVITE partner network including schools, school districts, national organizations, and nonprofits. The Institute will offer programs to support students' participation in research experiences, undergraduate courses in AI in education, and professional development programs for teachers.<br/><br/>Institute research will pursue foundational AI advances in robust and fair machine learning, learner modeling, natural language understanding, and generative AI applications for education to enable assessment and modeling of noncognitive skill development over time and across domains. It will revolve around three interconnected strands: (1) Collect, analyze, and share novel datasets for fair and robust machine learning and natural language understanding; (2) Build novel, robust methods for understanding learner behaviors and persistent, integrated learner models that incorporate assessments of noncognitive skills; (3) Develop new computer science learning environments that provide natural and adaptive interaction with pedagogical agents and intelligent scaffolding. Interpretable generative models fit to real data and simulated learners will enable new discoveries and hypotheses about human learning in programming contexts. Use-inspired research will advance the science of noncognitive skill acquisition during computer science learning and uncover relevant contextual aspects of learning historically overlooked by AI systems. The institute will serve as a nexus for building capacity for research, education, and expanded participation in the intersection of AI and computer science education, serving a wide array of stakeholders. Specifically, the Institute will (1) produce a database of multimodal datasets for use by other researchers, (2) provide open source tools and opportunities to develop knowledge about the use, control, and impact of innovative AI-enabled education systems, and (3) actively build a strong workforce of future scientists and engineers to design, implement, and deploy the next generation of AI-enabled Education for All systems.<br/><br/>The National Center for Education Research at the Institute of Education Sciences of the US Department of Education is partnering with NSF to provide funding for the Institute.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graph analysis has been central for multiple communities, including the classical graph theory community, network analysis, graph optimization, as well as the modern day graph learning communities. Traditionally, graphs are regarded as purely combinatorial objects. However, as applications of graphs proliferate, they tend to be regarded as much richer structures. For example, a graph might be viewed as a noisy skeleton of a hidden geometric domain, and there could be rich, complex data associated with its nodes or edges. While this viewpoint is not new, existing algorithmic treatments of graphs have not yet fully leveraged this perspective. In this project, the investigators aim to further integrate various (geo)metric and topological perspectives into graph analysis in order to enrich graph analysis algorithms and broaden the range of methodologies one can use to tackle diverse graph related tasks. This project will integrate ideas and notions from metric geometry, applied topology, spectral geometry and also algorithms to develop new perspectives and effective methods to analyze complex graphs. It will inject new ideas to graph analysis and learning, while at the same time also advancing the field of geometric and topological data analysis. Given the ubiquity of graphs data, methods resulting from this project can potentially impact various application fields, from scientific domains such as molecular biology, materials science, neuroscience, to engineering domains such as chip design. Results from this project will be integrated into the data science curriculum, strengthening the workforce by training undergraduates and graduates in data science.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigators will consider a range of important problems related to the study of individual as well as of collections of graphs. A central theme of this project is to view graphs as objects enriched beyond their combinatorial structures. Two specific research thrusts that the investigators will focus on are: (1) various graph distances, trade-offs between their discriminating power and computational complexity, and potential applications in graph sparsification and in the study of graph neural networks; and (2) modeling, recovering and using (potentially higher order) structures in graphs. To tackle the challenges emerging from these two research thrusts, the investigators will use various metric and topological methods. Examples include viewing graphs as metric spaces and bringing in topological tools (e.g., the interleaving distance from applied topology) to compare them; viewing graphs as metric measure spaces so as to use optimal transport ideas; and bringing together topological persistence through the high dimensional Laplace operator to study spectral structures induced by graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), APAR will make measurements of clouds and severe storms all over the world, including over oceans, rough land, and forested regions, which are mostly unreachable by conventional radar systems thereby eliminating a data gap in atmospheric science research. As the next-generation operational weather observing capability for the United States, APAR meets a critical need for new weather observations. With new capabilities to see deep into the three-dimensional structure of intense storms and cloud systems, crucial new insights are gained into the distribution of water vapor, precipitation, and associated radiative processes that govern Earth's energy balance. APAR measurements will be used to test predictions about severe weather, including tropical cyclones, tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds, hail, and flash flooding, and allow researchers to record the complex and changing lifecycle of severe systems. APAR will be a requestable community facility in the GEO /AGS Lower Atmosphere Observing Facilities pool. The implementation and subsequent operation of APAR will offer the research community access to high-resolution radar data for engineering and scientific analyses, and help mitigate threats and risks to transportation, forestry, agriculture, economy, and health. Other innovations include mapping out characteristics of insect/bird migrations over thousands of kilometers and the development of innovative software solutions. Funding for APAR will enable significant opportunities for training a diverse workforce by incorporating educational and training opportunities that will draw from underrepresented and minority student, educator, and researcher populations. Multi-faceted and -lingual outreach and education events and products are planned to reach a broad and diverse audience through the NCAR Explorer Series.<br/><br/>APAR will be the world?s first phased array C-band (5 cm wavelength), dual-Doppler, dual-polarization radar with fast-scan agility to be carried on an aircraft. It will consist of four removable active electronically scanned array antennas that will be mounted on the fuselage of the NSF/NCAR C-130.  The engineering breakthroughs required to implement APAR push the boundaries of current phased-array-radar technology, including antenna performance never previously achieved and tools and techniques (including signal processing to derive a multitude of storm characteristics) to harvest the copious volumes of data to be collected. Compared to ground-based platforms which must alternate between data collection and transit modes, APAR will be able to obtain continuous three dimensional, very high spatiotemporal resolution observations of storm kinematics and microphysical cloud properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hollow pillars are unique in that they exhibit adhesion changes over 1000 times when buckling under pressure. Tunable dry adhesion has many applications including pick-and-place manufacturing and haptics. However, current approaches to tunable dry adhesion still suffer from limited adhesion changes. Many also require high power consumption and long activation time. This research will introduce a new approach to highly tunable dry adhesion using soft hollow pillar structures. The study will examine the effects of geometry, material stiffness, and buckling on the fundamental adhesion mechanics of these soft hollow structures. The results from this project will advance the development of soft grippers for manipulation of small, curved, and thin parts that are difficult to manipulate using current approaches. The new mechanics knowledge gained will also benefit the design of other robotic mechanisms, such as haptics. This project also has a set of integrated education and outreach programs to broaden its impacts including course development, undergraduate research opportunities, soft robotics summer camps at a local STEM museum, and interactions with industry partners.<br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER project is to unravel fundamental mechanics of highly tunable dry adhesion of soft hollow pillars through constrained buckling for compliant manipulation applications. Specifically, the project will investigate (1) constrained buckling of cylindrical soft hollow pillars under low pressure and how the geometric and material parameters impact its adhesion mechanics; (2) the impact of cross section shape on tunable adhesion of soft hollow pillars; (3) the impact of using smart materials with tunable stiffness on tunable adhesion of soft hollow pillars; and (4) the impact of bistable bottom surface on tunable adhesion of soft hollow pillars. Both experiments and finite element simulations will be used to address these fundamental mechanics problems. The success of this project will generate new mechanics knowledge that advances the field of tunable dry adhesion for compliant manipulation and other robotic mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A primary focus of the research resides in the development of these theories in settings which lack traditional notions of smoothness or regularity, for instance, in fractal spaces. Some of the research topics under consideration are motivated by questions in physics, engineering, or mathematical finance. A potential benefit of success in this project lies in the possibility to bring tools from one mathematical field to bear on other fields, thereby increasing the interactions between areas of mathematics. The project also provides opportunities for collaboration and for the mentoring and training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three subjects within the broad field of nonsmooth analysis, geometry, and probability. First, spaces of Sobolev functions and functions of bounded variation will be considered on general metric measure space. The theory of Sobolev spaces on abstract metric measure spaces has attracted substantial attention over the past few decades. In this context the upper gradient approach has proved to be one of the most successful approaches. However, due to the lack of sufficient connectivity, the approach via upper gradients fails to be effective in many fractal spaces. This project will explore an alternative approach to Sobolev spaces, building on prior work of Korevaar and Schoen, which is more effective in fractal settings. A second direction of research involves fractional Gaussian fields and the parabolic and hyperbolic Anderson models on Dirichlet metric measure spaces. A key goal here is to develop a general theory of fractional Gaussian fields and Anderson models on general Dirichlet spaces, including fractals. Motivation arises from mathematical physics, and challenging properties such as intermittency and localization will be investigated. Finally, the project takes up the study of random matrices and symmetric spaces, exploring how Riemannian fibrations of symmetric spaces enable the construction of integrable random matrix functionals. Integrable here is understood in the sense that the Laplace transforms of such functionals can explicitly be expressed using special functions. These explicit formulas will be employed to obtain suitable limit theorems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, natural language generation systems (NLGs) are becoming popular. Examples include question and answer systems and chatbots that are used for advancing public health, and social sensing systems that are used for emergency response and crime prevention. However, there are risks that attackers may be able to manipulate these systems leading to poor outputs and poor decision-making. Robustness to adversaries in deep learning systems has become an active topic in the machine learning and security communities, but the robustness of NLG-based systems is much less studied. This is important to address because there are many differences in the nature of the data and algorithms deep learning and NLG systems employ, as well as the types of tasks they are used for. This project will address these differences through a comprehensive look at the kinds of attacks natural language generation systems are vulnerable to, developing both mathematical models of their vulnerabilities and strategies for reducing them through changes in how NLG systems are designed. This, in turn, will lead to safer, more trustworthy NLG systems and provide a number of educational opportunities for students involved in the research and related classes.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to understand NLG systems' attack surface and vulnerabilities and develop novel empirical and theoretical methods for increasing their adversarial robustness. The work will be grounded in two common NLG tasks, summarization and question-answering, and structured around three interconnected aims. The first is developing a framework and proposing novel AI-based optimization methods for examining NLG systems against various attack models. The second is having an in-depth analysis and characterization of vulnerabilities that lead to such attacks. The third is developing a set of defensive methods and tools for enhancing the robustness of NLG systems. This research will be integrated with education and outreach by providing research experiences for for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, incorporating research results into the course content development and curriculum design, and organizing workshops and competitions to reduce the gap between NLP and cybersecurity programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Subduction zones provide the opportunity to systematically investigate multiple hazards simultaneously in locations that generate some of the largest risk from geological events. In addition, the geometry of subduction zones permits unusually well-controlled natural experiments that can be used to isolate and study key factors driving geohazards. The study of subduction zones is intrinsically an international enterprise because:  (1) Comparison across regions allows for insights about the controlling factors of the tectonic, volcanic and landscape systems. (2) Large geohazards are inherently rare events that require a portfolio approach globally to guarantee the correct observations are made systematically.  Significant investments in subduction zone geohazards are now being made internationally. Active networks in Latin America, Europe, North America, Oceania and Asia are currently pursuing complementary science agendas and building large-scale deployments. Coordination between activities is needed to ensure that the maximum science is obtained from these efforts. SZNet would combine 14 networks across 5 continents with a particular emphasis on improving observations in Chile, which hosts one of the world?s most geologically active and accessible subduction zones. Multiple projects on and offshore are working to establish the large-scale data collection and research effort required to study this exemplary system and coordination is needed to optimize the scientific output both here and globally. <br/>   <br/>The goal of SZNet is to develop an intellectual community with  three missions:<br/>1.	to compare observations of subduction zones around the globe with a common dataset and understanding,<br/>2.	to cooperate to consistently instrument critical subduction zones that can provide key and transferrable insights, and<br/>3.	to develop and nurture an international and diverse cadre of early career scientists that is equipped to make the necessary breakthroughs.<br/>These missions will be supported through a combination of workshops, webinars, data exchanges, field schools, pilot projects and student exchanges. We anticipate that these activities will allow a portfolio approach to observations to enable geographical coverage that will both create the necessary baseline data and maximize the chances of capturing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and landslides. In addition, the exchange of ideas will benefit partner networks while stimulating coordinated deployment and research strategies. Understanding geohazards has direct societal significance for the inhabitants of the Pacific Rim and other subduction zones around the world. The lack of understanding of the fundamental controls on when and where impactful earthquakes, eruptions and landslides can happen is a major impediment to focussing resources and mitigation efforts.

This project funds imaging and spectroscopic observations in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) part of the coronal emission during the 8 April 2024 total solar eclipse (TSEs). The observations will probe the most critical spatial extent of the solar corona spanning the solar surface out to several solar radii (Rs). Observing sites across the US path of totality will be selected to acquire 20 minutes of continuous observations. Graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Hawaii will participate in TSE observations and engage with local communities at the observing sites for outreach. This project is in response to NSF Dear Colleague Letter 23-014: Great American Solar Eclipses 2023 and 2024.<br/><br/>Remote sensing broadband, narrowband and spectroscopic imaging during TSEs are currently the only tools for exploring the underlying physical processes responsible for producing complex coronal structures due to the intricate coupling between coronal plasmas and magnetic fields. These processes also produce the steep temperature gradient beyond the 6000 K surface temperature which is responsible for coronal expansion in the form of the solar wind. Inferences of plasma properties from observations of coronal emission resulting from scattering, collisions and photo-excitation, the broadband visible and select emission from ions at discrete wavelengths in the VIS and NIR wavelength range include the elemental and ionic composition of coronal plasmas, species temperatures, densities, outflow velocities and non-thermal motions. Predicted to coincide with a maximum in solar activity, operation of the instrumentation at the 2024 TSE from multiple observing sites spread across a few thousand km will further provide the thermodynamic characteristics of dynamic events, such as jets, waves, turbulence and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), triggered primarily by erupting prominences. The accessibility, duration and availability of multiple observing sites during the 2024 total solar eclipse will not only provide invaluable scientific data but will also offer an outstanding opportunity for education and public outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports the research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Speciation, the process by which new species evolve, is a fundamental process of evolution that must be studied by exploring the relationships between different groups of organisms. This is often done with a focus on factors that keep groups separated, known as isolating barriers. Research on isolating barriers is often approached through laboratory experiments or surveys of natural variation. This project will unite these approaches to investigate the progression of speciation in a group of monkeyflowers that are known to have rapidly evolved such barriers?in particular, the inability to create healthy seeds when crossed. Genomic investigations of monkeyflower plants from regions where two species meet and produce progeny will be combined with greenhouse crosses to study naturally occurring variation and its consequences. This work will also allow them to make direct connections between barrier phenotypes and the flow of genetic information between two young species. <br/><br/>The fellow will use accessions from 5 replicated hybrid zones to genomically dissect the dynamics of introgression between recently diverged Mimiulus guttatus and M. decorus. Patterns of ancestry will be used to identify the rate, timing, and directionality of gene flow. Next, by assessing ancestry correlation among sites in the genome (i.e. patterns of ancestry disequilibrium), the fellow will identify putative incompatibility alleles. Lastly, the fellow will resurrect inbred lines derived from the originally sequenced plants to assess the phenotypes associated with putative incompatibility. The fellow will also mentor undergraduate researchers and provide workshops for graduate students on essential computational research skills.

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. With climate change and population density on the rise, global food demand is projected to substantially increase. Nanobiotechnology offers sustainable approaches to help supply agricultural demands by adapting nano-sized materials to monitor plant health and to deliver nutrients or genetic material (RNA and DNA) to increase crop yields. Plants spontaneously react to nanomaterials by forming internal structures called biocoronas. Biocoronas can impact the effectiveness of nanomaterials for agricultural applications, such as blocking the release of genetic material for gene editing. To increase the potential and successful use of nanomaterials in crops, the Fellow will characterize biocoronas, and use this information to optimize gene-editing mediated by nanomaterials. The Fellow will also work to promote diversity at the host institution, using social media, and through outreach to migrant farm-worker communities. <br/><br/>The Fellow aims to extract and identify the in planta biocorona composition from the surfaces of nanocarriers functionalized with genetic material, such as silencing RNA. Enriched proteins, lipids and metabolites will be identified through untargeted multi-omic approaches and datasets will be fed into machine learning algorithms that can predict the in planta biocorona formation in various agricultural crops. Moreover, these datasets will be used to develop gene-editing nanocarriers with specific surface chemistries, such as single protein coatings that enhance nanotechnology uptake efficacy and payload release for post-transcriptional gene silencing, which will be validated using RT-qPCR. The Fellow will enhance computational skills through training workshops, organize nanobiotechnology seminars held at the host campus, and lead informational sessions tailored to undergraduates from historically excluded groups interested in pursuing graduate degrees in STEM. The Fellow will disseminate the results of this project at specialized international scientific conferences and through social media platforms.

However, they are best known for energy transduction and are often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell.  This project focuses on mitochondrial structure because without appropriate structure, mitochondria become dysfunctional.  Although mitochondria developed from an ancestral bacterial cell, different organisms (e.g., humans, amoeba, algae, yeast, etc.) maintain mitochondrial structure in different ways.  If we can understand the mechanisms that maintain structure across these organisms, we can learn why the mechanisms are different while also gaining insight into the causes of mitochondrial dysfunction. The broader impacts of this project include the intrinsic merit of the work as the vast majority of eukaryotic cells contain these organelles.  Other activities will involve K-16 students.  Students at a primarily undergraduate university in central Arkansas will carry out this project.  Exposure to quality, well-funded research provides students the ability to explore whether research is an appropriate career choice for them. It prepares students for doctoral programs, and mentoring students in research is critical for retention of those from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM.  In addition to training undergraduates, this project involves outreach to K-6 students.  The plan is to formalize relationships with local elementary schools, specifically ones whose ACT Aspire scores indicate a deficit in science.  Interactions with K-6 students via hands-on-activities are designed to inspire students, show them that science is fun, and continue to develop their scientific inquiry skills. <br/><br/>The essential functions of the mitochondria are dependent upon their structure, which, in turn, is dependent upon mitochondrial dynamics, fission, fusion, and motility.  In many cell types such as mammalian and yeast cells, a protein family known as dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) maintains the highly interconnected network of mitochondria. Importantly, our model organism, Dictyostelium discoideum does not use DRPs to regulate mitochondrial dynamics.  Rather, the D. discoideum genome encodes two proteins, FszA and FszB, which are derived from the bacterial cell division protein, FtsZ.  It is not understood why some organisms use DRPs and some use what appears to be derived FtsZ proteins.  A long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial dynamics in D. discoideum in order to identify when and why some organisms replaced FtsZs with DRPs as they evolved. The first project goal is to identify the role of extant FtsZs in mitochondrial dynamics and will involve altering protein levels, identifying interacting proteins, and analyzing FtsZs structural complexes. Recent work has shown that the cytoskeleton is a major player in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, and the second goal of this project is to study the relationship of the cytoskeleton with mitochondrial dynamics by identifying fission/fusion events, along with transport velocities when the cytoskeleton is disrupted. Completion of this project will help determine if FtsZs function like DRPs, and how the D. discoideum cytoskeleton regulates mitochondrial dynamics. Ultimately, this work will contribute to understanding the evolution of mitochondria and mitochondrial dynamics and specifically why some organisms use DRPs and some use FtsZs.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competititive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective is to help the user with grasping and holding actions, and enable performance of tasks of daily living. The project focuses on three assistance methods. The first is to use the high reaction speed of the robot to anticipate and augment the user's own grasp reflexes. The second is to provide natural and comfortable collaborative grasping and holding, by having the robot adapt its response to user preference. The third combines both anticipatory reflex augmentation and adaptive collaborative grasping to bestow maximal benefits under conditions of realistic variability and uncertainty. This work addresses fundamental issues of shared human-robot collaboration and the design of assistive mechanisms. It advances the health and welfare of people with disabilities, and increases their ability to function independently. Other benefits to society are the development of new educational techniques to broaden participation of people with disabilities in engineering and science, both in the classroom and in the local community.<br/><br/>For people with disabilities capable of partial body-power, miscoordination with a robotic exoskeleton can lead to inefficiency, slowness, and frustration. This project introduces an unexplored modality for assistive grasping devices called collaborative grasping, or co-grasping, which is suitable to augment people with partial body power. This approach fundamentally alters the role of robotic elements with the goal of improving shared task performance and device embodiment. The project pursues two primary functional outcomes: (R1) reducing the rate of accidental object drops using tactile sensors and robot-led reflexes and (R2) easing body movements with robotic support to improve comfort and skill during reach-and-grasp. The methods used include the modification of a novel co-grasping testbed to also enable human-only and robot-only control cases, to probe interwoven questions of intelligence and embodiment through human subjects experiments. Specific experiments investigate the role of inherent haptic feedback on physical human robot interaction and user perception during challenging grasping tasks. The capstone of this project (R1+R2) is a collaborative arbitration prototype to accomplish (R1) and (R2) concurrently, including during realistic tasks of daily living. Overall, this work generates new tools and knowledge to improve and personalize the integration of robotic systems with the hands to enhance human independence and wellbeing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is important in determining the efficacy of drug delivery. For example, electric fields can create transient pores on a cell membrane, a process called electroporation, which is used to deliver cargo into cells, but it remains a challenge to achieve efficient delivery without causing irreversible damage. This award will use sub-nanometer resolution imaging to capture how cell membranes dynamically respond upon applying an external electric field. The understanding of intracellular delivery gained will not only benefit the biomedical field, but also biomolecule manufacture, gene editing and other intracellular investigations. This imaging capability will also benefit the understanding of solid-liquid interface systems in applications including fuel cells, batteries, and corrosion/erosion processes. In synergy with the research activities, the knowledge of bio-interfaces and imaging techniques will be disseminated to the general public, by developing and using mobile and webpage apps for workflow visualization, doing demos of bio-interfaces to K-12 students and senior residents, and providing training to both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This award will use an atomic force microscope with sub-nanometer and high temporal resolution to offer the molecular-level imaging, with a focus on revealing the dynamic responses of lipid bilayer and its hydration structure under an external electric field. The understanding of nanoscale interactions involved in the drug delivery process are still limited due to lack of appropriate imaging tools. The key hypothesis in this work is that the hydration structure of lipid bilayer determines the nanoscale interactions of lipid bilayer with drug molecules and the biophysical behavior of lipid bilayer under the external stimuli. Three research thrusts will be initiated: i) imaging the dynamic changes of lipid bilayer under an electric field; ii) capturing the structural changes of hydration structures involved in lipid bilayer reconfiguration; and iii) establishing the structure-property relationship for different types of lipid and solution chemistry. The proposed research activities aim to resolve and understand the pore formation and sealing processes during electroporation of lipid bilayers and reveal the role of hydration structure in this process.

Soft lithography will be used to fabricate two-dimensional porous environments with different heterogeneities. Using optical microscopy, the changes in network structure and flow distribution will be monitored upon injection of antisolvent to precipitate the polymer.

Continuous innovation of rechargeable batteries that supply power to an electric motor is required to boost the adoption of EVs since the battery significantly affects the driving range, safety, and cost of EVs. A lithium/sulfur (Li/S) battery consisting of a lithium metal anode and sulfur cathode is a promising candidate for EV applications as it has the potential for a five-times longer driving distance at a given weight of the EV battery compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. The major challenges towards the development of reliable and safe Li/S batteries are 1) the need to mitigate problematic issues associated with chemical compounds called lithium polysulfides, which are formed in the organic liquid electrolyte during battery operation, and 2) the flammable ionic conductor used as electrolyte. A Li/S solid-state battery is a promising system for overcoming these issues because it uses a solid-state electrolyte which is non-flammable and can prevent polysulfide formation better than liquid electrolytes. However Li/S solid-state batteries suffer from poor energy storage/delivery performance due to an insufficient understanding of the electrode-solid electrolyte interface. This project will conduct fundamental studies on the interfaces in Li/S solid-state batteries, advanced materials characterization methods, and implement rational electrode design to address these challenges. The results from this project will create new knowledge that can enable energy storage solutions to meet the U.S.?s mission toward decarbonizing the global automotive sector and shaping the sustainable energy future. Comprehensive education and workforce development plans are laid out through a seamless partnership between Arizona State University and the University of Michigan Ann Arbor.

Printed tunable devices proposed in this work will allow the electrical tuning of circuit functions, drastically reducing the cost, footprint, and weight of the overall circuitry compared to mechanically tunable electrical devices. These printed tunable electrical devices are critical to national security, especially radio communications. In addition, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable devices will significantly benefit from the proposed tunable flexible electrical devices. However, currently, there are no tunable printable inks to fabricate tunable electrical devices on flexible substrates. In addition, existing printable materials need high-temperature processing (greater than 800 °C) to achieve the required tunability, which will damage most types of flexible substrates, such as plastics, paper, and fabrics. Multiple challenges and unique bottlenecks are associated with printable inks, and there are limited ongoing research efforts to solve these issues. This project will cover novel tunable materials syntheses, printable ink development, and the design, simulation, and fabrication of tunable electrical devices. This project will open a new paradigm of tunable flexible electronic devices. Both undergraduate and graduate students will directly benefit from this project, and the proposed educational outreach projects will enhance middle school students' interest and awareness of science and engineering careers. In addition, the proposed project's novel findings will be integrated into graduate-level printed electronics-related teaching.<br/><br/>This project will comprehensively advance the fundamental understanding of the utilization of sinterless Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) nanoparticles as a tunable material for flexible electronics. The composition of BST nanoparticles to achieve the highest possible dielectric constant and tunability at room temperature (without sintering) will be identified. An in depth investigation will be carried out to determine the effects of the Ba:Sr molar fraction, the size, and the packing density of BST nanoparticles on dielectric tunability. High-resolution X-Ray diffraction patterns of sinterless BST nanoparticles under an applied electric field will be used to investigate the correlation between the variation of lattice parameters and the dielectric tunability. This will give a greater insight into the dielectric tunability of sinterless BST nanoparticles, which have not been experimentally reported yet. Lowering the required bias voltage to less than 25 Volts is a significant achievement that enables the usage of printed tunable flexible devices in real-world applications, such as phase shifters, frequency-selective surfaces, and phased array antennas.

These advances have been partly due to advanced perception capabilities (using vision and haptics) and new learning models and algorithms for manipulation and control. However, state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems remain limited in their sensing and perception to a direct line of sight and direct contact with the objects they need to perceive. The goal of this project is to design, build, and evaluate a cyber-physical system that can sense, perceive, learn, and manipulate far beyond what is feasible using existing systems. To do so, the research will explore the terahertz band, which offers a new sensing dimension by inferring the inherent material properties of objects via wireless terahertz signals and without direct contact.  This project will also explore radio-frequency signals that can traverse occlusions. Building on these emerging sensing modalities, the core of the project focuses on developing full-spectrum perception, control, learning, and manipulation tasks. The success of this project will result in CPS system architectures with unprecedented capabilities, enabling fundamentally new opportunities to make robotic manipulation more efficient and allowing robots to perform new complex tasks that have not been possible before. <br/><br/>The project will enable robotic perception via full-spectral wireless sensing in order to unlock unprecedented robotic manipulation capabilities. This research involves learning synergies between sensing and control- whereby sensing is used for control and vice-versa - to optimize the end-to-end cyber-physical tasks. In particular, this research includes three inter-connected thrusts: (i) It will enable a new sensing modality that exploits high-resolution terahertz frequencies for robotic imaging and inference; (ii) It aims to build a new learning platform for full spectrum (mmWave, THz, and vision) perception to enable beyond-vision perception and reasoning in non-line-of-sight and cluttered environments, where optical systems lack in performance; and (iii) It presents a platform to learn the synergies between sensing and control to further co-optimize the end-to-end robotic manipulations tasks.

Existing text-based privacy policies are hard to read and make sense of, making it hard for people to understand what a mobile app will do with their data. This has led major app stores to require apps to use standardized ?privacy labels??akin to nutrition labels?to help people make informed choices about the apps they use; however, it is unclear how well these labels work in the real world. This project will attack this question by studying how privacy labels work for three main groups: app developers who must select correct labels for their apps; app store administrators that create the policies and standards for the labels; and end users who must use them to make privacy decisions. The team will also analyze mobile apps to see how well they adhere to the promises made by their privacy labels, and how both people?s understandings of privacy labels and apps? adherence to them changes over time. Together the work will lead to better understanding, design, and use of privacy labels for both regulators and people who use mobile apps.<br/> <br/>To address these questions, the project will apply a mixed-methods approach. For studying end users, the research team will perform iterative usability testing and longitudinal comprehension studies to gauge understanding of these new privacy labels and how it changes over time. The team will also use factorial vignettes analyzed by multivariate regressions to identify factors of both existing and hypothetical privacy label designs that might impact user decision making around installing, using, and granting permissions to apps. For studying developers and platforms, the team will conduct quantitative measurement studies using a ?privacy label observatory? that will periodically collect a number of versions of both apps and their privacy labels, using dynamic software analysis of the apps to determine their use of private information. This will help answer questions about whether privacy labels become more accurate over time as developers become more familiar with them, as well as how the app ecosystem reacts to events like regulatory or company policy changes and enforcement actions. The primary outcomes of this project will be empirical data on whether these new privacy tools are working, how and why they might be failing both app developers and consumers alike, and how platforms can improve their design to make them more effective. This will include public datasets about current and historical usage of privacy labels, as well as design patterns and policy recommendations for improving the state of privacy labels and mobile app privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There, participating students will learn the methods of behavioral and ecological data collection from senior UNBP researchers, and they will also have the opportunity to develop their own research projects based on their interests within the broad topics of baboon behavior and ecology. This experience will benefit the participating students by training them in behavioral and ecological data collection methods and by giving them the opportunity to conduct fieldwork in a foreign country, which will greatly increase their likelihood to succeed when pursuing graduate or professional careers in fields related to animal behavior and ecological monitoring.<br/><br/>As our closest living relatives, other primates are the most common models for understanding the evolution of our own species. In particular, olive baboons are highly intelligent, socially complex, and behaviorally flexible animals that live in an ecological context similar to that in which our own species likely evolved. The long-term data collected at the UNBP have tracked the ways in which these animals can adapt ? both behaviorally and physiologically ? to a rapidly changing anthropogenic environment, shedding light on the complex interactions between ecology and behavior and contributing to our understanding of how similar processes may have influenced human evolution. Through this IRES, a new generation of researchers will develop their own research projects at the UNBP, benefitting both from the mentorship of experienced baboon researchers and from the decades of data available at this site.

Most astronomers take images of large structures in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, observations of radio waves from pulsars traveling through the ISM allow access to much smaller scales. These pulsars act as probes within the Galaxy's active environments. Astronomers use pulsars to understand turbulence in the ISM, identify clouds and filaments, and even understand the wind of particles streaming from the Sun. The investigators will combine observations of hundreds of pulsars by many telescopes around the world. These will be combined to create Galaxy-sized detector known as a ""Pulsar ISM Array."" This work will connect pulsar astronomers around the world with many other communities to create a detailed picture of our dynamic Galaxy. The investigators will also build classroom laboratory and outreach demonstrations. These will engage students and the public in understanding the complex phenomena of the ISM.<br/><br/>The investigators will construct a ""Pulsar ISM Array"" (PISMA) analogous to a pulsar timing array (PTA) used in the study of low-frequency gravitational waves. Since all pulsar emission is dispersed by the ISM, all pulsars can contribute to the PISMA and not just the ultra-precise ones used in PTA experiments. In combining a wide-range of observables, including but not limited to pulsar dispersion measures, scintillation parameters, flux-density variations, secondary spectra, along with non-pulsar observables such as sky maps from H-alpha surveys, the PISMA will provide key insights into understanding the processes that govern the transfer of turbulent energy from kiloparsec to sub-AU scales; the formation, morphology, and population of compact plasma structures and larger-scale over-densities; and the extreme environmental conditions around pulsars themselves. Advancing understanding in these areas will also benefit understanding in the broader astronomical communities researching Fast Radio Bursts and extragalactic transients, space weather, and intraday variability of radio quasars, and provide input into the most sophisticated Galactic electron density maps yet created.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These advances have been partly due to advanced perception capabilities (using vision and haptics) and new learning models and algorithms for manipulation and control. However, state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems remain limited in their sensing and perception to a direct line of sight and direct contact with the objects they need to perceive. The goal of this project is to design, build, and evaluate a cyber-physical system that can sense, perceive, learn, and manipulate far beyond what is feasible using existing systems. To do so, the research will explore the terahertz band, which offers a new sensing dimension by inferring the inherent material properties of objects via wireless terahertz signals and without direct contact.  This project will also explore radio-frequency signals that can traverse occlusions. Building on these emerging sensing modalities, the core of the project focuses on developing full-spectrum perception, control, learning, and manipulation tasks. The success of this project will result in CPS system architectures with unprecedented capabilities, enabling fundamentally new opportunities to make robotic manipulation more efficient and allowing robots to perform new complex tasks that have not been possible before. <br/><br/>The project will enable robotic perception via full-spectral wireless sensing in order to unlock unprecedented robotic manipulation capabilities. This research involves learning synergies between sensing and control- whereby sensing is used for control and vice-versa - to optimize the end-to-end cyber-physical tasks. In particular, this research includes three inter-connected thrusts: (i) It will enable a new sensing modality that exploits high-resolution terahertz frequencies for robotic imaging and inference; (ii) It aims to build a new learning platform for full spectrum (mmWave, THz, and vision) perception to enable beyond-vision perception and reasoning in non-line-of-sight and cluttered environments, where optical systems lack in performance; and (iii) It presents a platform to learn the synergies between sensing and control to further co-optimize the end-to-end robotic manipulations tasks. These capabilities can open up entirely new realms of possibility to industrial robotics as well as assistive, warehousing, and smart home robotic. The research will be evaluated through extensive experimentation, prototype design, and system implementation. The results will be disseminated through close collaboration with industry and publications in top research venues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This possible modal alternative provides a safe, reliable, and environmentally sound option to reduce surface-level congestion. Nevertheless, the history of transportation infrastructure development shows that it is imperative to design transportation infrastructures with the community to find the best balance between these sociotechnical requirements. Much research shows that the design of transportation systems has a long-lasting, often discriminatory effect that reinforces existing socio-economic inequality. As UAM is being developed as a new transportation mode, we are at an opportune moment to design its infrastructure to provide effective and equitable air mobility for all, avoiding our past mistakes. This project will focus on understanding the preferences, attitudes, and concerns of all stakeholders of UAM, including the potential users of UAM, the general public in different communities who may be positively and/or adversely affected by UAM, policymakers, and city planners. The knowledge elicited from the stakeholders will guide the design of an open-source Computer Aided Planning tool that policy-makers and urban planners can use to design UAM infrastructure that accommodates communities? priorities and enables transportation equity.  While the timeline for UAM may be in the future, its deployment may entail significant future investment in infrastructure which makes inclusion of equity considerations and early community engagement critical.<br/><br/>We propose a ''Community-in-the-Loop Integrative Framework for Fair and Equitable Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Infrastructure Design''. Our integrative framework will develop methods to engage with key stakeholders to address significant socio-technical challenges, including (a) understanding the community preferences and desiderata in terms of necessary considerations for equitable mobility, (b) developing novel machine learning techniques to generate design options that optimize for community desiderata efficiently and (c) devising community-driven evaluative measures and trade-off decision mechanisms. We address these challenges by drawing from urban and transportation engineering, aerospace, and computer and information sciences. The final product of our framework is an open-source Computer Aided Planning tool called VertiCAP. VertiCAP will be equipped with novel machine learning-based algorithms to navigate complex design space options, including long-term decisions (i.e., allocation of UAM airports, also known as vertiports), medium-term decisions (i.e., design of air space), and short-term decisions (i.e., air-traffic control). We will establish a ''community council'' representing different stakeholders. Through continuous interactions with the community council, we will evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed VertiCAP tool in the City of Austin, TX and Southern California.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will work with drivers to obtain location and operational data and generate optimized and coordinated guidance on tactical and operational decisions to maximize their welfare. Transportation agencies and local communities could partner with drivers to gain insights into the market and optimize policies to meet societal goals. The independence of ride-sourcing drivers comes at the price of social isolation and anxiety. This project will chart a technology-inspired pathway to better connection and organization of the diffusive workforce, and increase its cohesion, vitality, and social contribution. Ride-sourcing drivers are more likely from the lower income and other vulnerable parts of the population, and the project prototype serves as an outreach tool to improve their well-being, in addition to being a test bed for the research program. The PI will incorporate the research results in her graduate/upper-class undergraduate courses on transportation systems analysis and economics, where traditionally the supplier side of the transportation market is not treated in the same depth as the consumer side.  <br/><br/>There are three major research objectives: 1) Understand drivers' learning and choice behaviors using dynamic discrete choice models grounded on psychologically sound learning theories; 2) Develop model-based and model-free algorithms to optimize decisions on when to start and end working, where to search for passengers and whether to accept a ride request, scalable to the level of driver participation; 3) Generate behaviorally informed driver guidance synthesizing results from previous two objectives. The project is innovative in three major aspects. First, it provides an alternative approach to enhancing the ride-sourcing market by directly working with drivers instead of platforms as commonly done in the literature and practice. The driver-centered approach is potentially more socially efficient due to the avoidance of a platform's tendency for over-supply and fairer due to its collaborative nature. Secondly, it advances understandings of drivers' learning and choice making dynamics under uncertainty at various temporal scales: routing and order acceptance at the minute-to-minute level, and scheduling at the hour-to-hour level. This integrated approach will fill the knowledge gap of reasons and dynamics behind the low retention rate of ride-sourcing drivers. Thirdly, it contributes to the development of high-performance optimization algorithms for ride-sourcing operations with an emphasis on the scalability to the level of driver participation and data availability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New experimental techniques use X-rays to track the dynamics of electrons and nuclei during chemical reactions at extremely short time scales. These experiments can also reveal how molecules interact with their environment. It is difficult to extract the atomistic mechanism of reactions from X-ray experiments alone. Quantum mechanical calculations play an important role in interpreting X-ray experiments. Scientists cannot accurately perform these calculations for many interesting molecules due to the challenges created by the correlated motion of electrons. Evangelista and his research group are developing methods that will enable simulations of state-of-the-art experiments that can be used to track reactions in complex chemical environments. This project will create new open-source computer codes that implement the theories developed by Evangelista and that are freely available. The Evangelista group also plans to engage undergraduates in summer research as part of the team to help build the future STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce.<br/><br/>Under this award, Francesco Evangelista and his team will develop methods to compute core-excited states for molecules in regimes where many-body correlations contribute significantly to the wave function. The approach will employ the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) formalism to account for dynamical correlation effects to produce an effective Hamiltonian for a manifold of electronic states. The project seeks to develop a new technique to target specific valence- and core-excited diabatic states and will apply these methods to simulate state-of-the-art experiments that track bond-dissociation processes. The group also seeks to extend their computations to molecules adsorbed on semiconductors and solid-state defect qubits by combining the GAS (general activation space)-DSRG approach with multi-reference quantum embedding methods. These techniques are intended to address the problem of computing full X-ray absorption spectra for transient species as their molecular geometry and electronic state evolve over time. The proposed methods will be general in that they will apply to both ground and valence-excited starting states. More broadly, these developments are expected contribute to the advancement of multi-reference theories with potential impact on the related areas of photochemistry and chemical reactivity. These methods are potentially deployable for the simulation of diamond defects with relevance to quantum information science (QIS) as, for example, in the use of X-ray spectroscopy for the characterization of solid-state qubits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Worldwide, 13 million laparoscopic surgeries are performed each year. Surgeons require proper visualization of the operating site which entails continually wiping the lens, reinserting the scope, relocating the surgical site, and then resuming the surgery. This difficulty in visualization results in the need to temporarily halt the operation and potentially lose critical focus of the surgical area in order to restore the surgical field of view. Surgeons repeat this process an average of six times per hour, accounting for nearly 1/3 of the operating time. This time delay results in an estimated loss of 336,000 hours of operating room procedure time and $1.25 billion in productivity losses in the United States alone each year.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase 1 project will develop operating prototypes of a novel, flexible, micro-mechanical mechanism with multiple degrees of freedom. The device integrates flexible and conforming mechanisms with a wiping blade to enable real time wiping of surgical scopes and ports. This technology enables surgeons to quickly and intraoperatively re-enable laparoscope vision within the patient. The technical challenges of the project include the development of a computational engineering model that optimizes user control of off-axis stiffness, force response, and stress.

Multifunctional protective coating materials and processes are urgently needed to alleviate the problem of ineffective coating technologies.  For example, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems costs can represent more than 50% percent of a building?s energy consumption, yet the high cost of maintenance and corrosion of commercial HVAC units are often overlooked. Humidity and exposure to pollutants like hydrocarbons are major causes of corrosion, commonly observed on the heat exchanger coils from HVAC systems. When corrosion sets in, the operating efficiency can soon be reduced by 50-70%, and unit life halved. This will progressively increase energy bills, discharge of CO2, and health risks for occupants. Current epoxy-based coatings are thick polymers with low thermal conductivity, which commonly act as an insulating layer and inevitably reduce the heat exchange efficiency by up to 15%. Moreover, epoxy coatings are neither flexible nor UV resistant. Eventually, they tend to peel off or disintegrate, which leaves the coils unprotected from corrosion damage. The proposed hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) protective coating may increase heat exchange by 70%, and add elevated anti-corrosion, anti-abrasion properties to HVAC systems to survive harsh working environments reducing energy costs and emissions. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a scalable chemical-assisted ball-mill process for large-scale production of ultra-fine hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanosheets.  The hBN nanosheet is an electrically insulating and thermally conductive layered material with excellent thermal and chemical stabilities making it a promising anti-corrosion, anti-oxidation, anti-wear, as well as anti-erosion coating additive.  The manufacturing process starts with HBN powder, the polymer deformation and sheer force resulting from collision facilitate the exfoliation of commercial bulk hBN.  The process has the additional advantage of being able to integrate optional chemicals during ball-milling, which could provide hBN with designated chemical functionalities. In addition, thin hBN flakes may be further integrated into continuous film on various industrial substrates using existing coating techniques, such as vapor deposition and spray coating.  Successful development of the proposed technology may significantly improve coating performance and provide a process for integrating materials into a protective coating on different industrial substrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The frequencies of ULF waves overlap with the range of drift frequencies of energetic electrons as they circle the Earth, leading to resonant interactions.  Numerous expressions have been derived to quantitatively describe radial diffusion so that they can be incorporated into global models of radiation belt electrons.  However, most expressions of the radial diffusion rates are derived only for equatorially mirroring electrons and are based on estimates of the power of ULF waves that are obtained either from spacecraft close to the equatorial plane or from the ground.  Recent studies using the Van Allen Probes and Arase have shown that the wave power in magnetic fluctuations is significantly enhanced away from the magnetic equator, consistent with models simulating the natural modes of oscillation of magnetospheric field lines.  This has significant implications for the estimation of radial diffusion rates, as higher pitch angle electrons will experience considerably higher ULF wave fluctuations than equatorial electrons.  This project will derive the magnetic and electric field wave powers and incorporate them into the 3D test particle simulations to estimate the diffusion coefficient.  The novel, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion rates will be introduced to a global model of radiation belt electrons to evaluate the effect of the pitch-angle dependence of the diffusion coefficient on radiation belt dynamics.  The result could have significant implications for the radial diffusion rates as currently estimated.  It will pave the way for incorporating pitch-angle-dependent radial diffusion coefficients in global models to predict the near-Earth radiation environment better.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the role of off-equatorial Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves on the radial transport and diffusion of relativistic electrons (100s keV to few MeV) in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7), investigating the effect of pitch-angle-dependent radial transport of energetic particles on global dynamics of the radiation belts. The following science questions will be answered: How are ULF electric and magnetic field fluctuations distributed in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time under varying solar and geomagnetic conditions? What is the role of off-equatorial ULF wave fluctuations on the radial diffusion and transport of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7)? How are off-equatorial ULF waves expected to impact current radiation belt models, and what is their contribution to the global dynamics of the radiation belts?  The team will use multiple satellite datasets (THEMIS, Van Allen Probes, Cluster, and Arase), test particle tracing simulations, and a global radiation belt model to quantify the contribution of off-equatorial ULF waves on radial diffusion in the radiation belts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials are highly reactive in the environment and interact with elements available in soil and water, affecting their bioavailability for plants and microorganisms. The small size of metal-based nanomaterials results in a high rate of their uptake by living organisms including plants. The impact of nanomaterials on living organisms and their toxicity level depends on various factors including their size, concentration, and type, as well as the exposed organism. Studies on the fate of nanomaterials in the environment have reported the potential of plants to accumulate nanomaterials. However, the exact mechanism of nanomaterials uptake and their fate in plants is not well understood. Nanomaterials accumulated in plants can enter the human body through direct consumption of plants or through the food chain. Therefore, it is important to understand how they interact with plants to further protect public health and improve sustainable agricultural practices. This research project investigates the fate of the commonly used metal-based nanomaterial, silver nanoparticles, in plants and their interaction with essential plant nutrients such as potassium, magnesium, and zinc. This will involve a series of molecular, physiological, and analytical studies to understand the form and the site of accumulation of silver nanoparticles in plants, in addition to their impact on membrane transporters. The PI will mentor undergraduate and master?s students during the study and provide educational and research opportunities for underrepresented minorities in STEM fields including women, first-generation college students, and people of color. To improve public awareness about nanomaterials and their fate in plants, a three-dimensional model will be created based on the results of this study and will be displayed in a local science museum. <br/><br/>Nanomaterials are used worldwide in various sectors including medicine, agriculture, and industry. Silver nanoparticles are a common form of metal-based nanomaterials. These materials can be oxidized in the environment and be transformed into the ionic form, which is more interactive and toxic than the particulate form. Silver nanoparticles, in either particulate or ionic form, impact plant physiology and metabolism at various levels including the membrane transporters and electrical potential, which subsequently affects plant water absorption and nutrient translocation. Silver nanoparticles are not needed for plant growth and there is not a membrane transporter specifically designated for silver nanoparticles to enter cells. However, since plants can translocate and accumulate these nanoparticles in their tissues, there must be a transporter that allows these materials to pass across the membrane. Plasma membrane aquaporin and potassium channels are among the possible transporters for silver nanoparticles. Once these nanoparticles are taken up by plants, their presence in inter- and intra- cellular spaces changes the electrochemical potential of cells. To provide equilibrium, the expression of several membrane transporters including proton ATPase, and cation and anion channels can be impacted. This in turn affects the movement of essential nutrients and water across the membrane, turgor pressure, and cytosolic and apoplastic pH level. These series of events can impact the structure of xylem cells and subsequently bioaccumulation and translocation of essential nutrients and water in plants. Due to the role of aquaporins in the translocation of water, maintaining turgor pressure, and potentially transporting silver nanoparticles across the membrane, in this study tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and mutant for aquaporin PIP1 will be exposed to silver nanoparticles in order to determine the mechanism of translocation of these nanoparticles in plants and their interaction with plant essential nutrients. This project will include a series of analytical, molecular, and morphological analyses to achieve these aims, including the concentration, form, and site of silver nanoparticles accumulation in plants, the effects of their exposure on membrane transporters, and the impact of  their exposure on vascular tissues. Results will provide information in understanding the fate of nanomaterials in plants and to efficiently use plants for phytoremediation approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given its high power density and large force capacity, the hydraulic cylinder is a trusted workhorse across many industrial applications. By its design, it is also vulnerable to a variety of critical faults, such as seal failures, leakage, fluid contamination, and reduced load-carrying capacity, that may negatively affect performance and efficiency, and result in high costs from downtime, permanent damage, or operator injury. To ensure that such faults can be accurately detected and identified, this project relies on a combination of physics-based modeling and innovative frequency domain analysis to develop a novel diagnostic methodology that accounts for system nonlinearities and closed-loop operation. Such a diagnostic paradigm is also anticipated to find application in a variety of energy and power transmission systems, including electric vehicles. Efforts to disseminate research outcomes to local industry in Southeast Michigan, undergraduate research opportunities, and integration of modeling and systems diagnostics principles in coursework will produce broader societal impact.<br/><br/>This research aims to develop the foundations for a comprehensive systems diagnostics methodology for hydraulic cylinders that relies on physics-based modeling rather than statistics and machine learning techniques, as has been common in recent years.

Several tasks will be pursued through a combination of theoretical modeling, numerical simulations, and physical experiments, including comprehensive fault analysis using a nonlinear, inverse, frequency domain representation of the system dynamics, and formulation and testing of a parameter estimation algorithm for such a nonlinear inverse model under closed-loop operation using an adaptive digital twin.

With the growing demand for the Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems, and Smart Buildings there will be a significant increase in wireless sensor networks, all of which will require power to operate. However, batteries have a limited lifetime, therefore there is a need to create a self-sustaining system that can harvest energy from the ambient environment without the need of batteries. Vibration-based energy harvesters have the advantage of functioning 24/7 and can be applied to almost all applications. Microsystems-based energy harvesters have advantages such as small-scale and low cost, but there are numerous challenges which have limited their success. This study will investigate methods to solve those challenges and overcome the limitations. The goal of this study is to create a universal low-frequency microsystem vibration energy harvesting system to power these wireless sensor networks. The investigated methods to solve these challenges have potential to be applied to other microsystem applications to enhance sensor or actuating performance in the future. The project will impact society as well as the scientific community. In addition, this project aims to increase awareness of microsystems through an interdisciplinary STEM education outreach program directed at undergraduate and K-12 students. The program will develop outreach events to promote microsystems and STEM education to underrepresented students. The study of microsystems is interdisciplinary consisting of all STEM disciplines. The educational goal of this project is to increase awareness of microsystems and how they impact our daily lives to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.<br/> <br/>Microsystem vibration energy harvesters have been extensively investigated over the past decade but limitations due to their micro-scale and mechanisms of actions have limited the systems from progressing past the lab environment. There are four grand challenges that currently limit their use: 1) narrow frequency bandwidth, 2) lack of frequency tunability, 3) low power density, and 4) reliability. This study will investigate and develop novel designs and microfabrication methods to address these challenges. The research objective of this project is to enhance functionality of a low frequency low acceleration piezoelectric microsystem energy harvester by combining novel integration and actuation mechanisms to i) widen the bandwidth, ii) perform wide range active/passive frequency tuning, and iii) enhance power density using novel functional thin film material structures. Each component will be designed and characterized individually and then integrated together to develop a complete universal system that can overcome the current challenges associated with micro-scale vibration energy harvesters. Non-linear dynamics mechanisms to widen the bandwidth without significant decrease in power using monolithically integrated movable proof-mass will be investigated. This will result in a passive wide bandwidth system that does not require any additional power consumption. Frequency tuning will be investigated using a novel mass load distribution method that can be passive to increase manufacturability of the devices and promote batch fabrication advantages of microsystems to obtain a universal low-frequency system for multiple applications (<250 Hz). An active tuning mechanism based on mass load distribution with a targeted frequency range of 200 Hz with a resolution of <1 Hz will also be investigated. Power density will be enhanced by developing new polarity controlled piezoelectric structures by enhancing material properties of ternary nitride thin films. Integration of these methods to create a monolithic all-in-one system requires novel microfabrication methods which will be developed and can be applied to future microsystem applications beyond energy harvesters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A collaborative team of mathematics faculty, instructional designers, equity-minded practitioners, and accessibility experts will work together to design mobile-friendly course shells, or digital containers for course content, grading, and centralized student-instructor communication. In addition, they will also provide linked professional development opportunities to faculty. The majority of students in online courses use mobile devices to access course content. However, research has shown that women, students of color, students with disabilities, first-generation students, students who are independent, and students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds see their devices as significantly more important to their success than do their peers outside these groups. While this establishes a clear need for mobile-friendly courses, there is a lack of research and guidelines on how to design online courses that are mobile accessible. In addition, there is a lack of research on how mobile-friendly courses affect student success in STEM. This project will develop empirically-based guidelines for designing mobile-friendly courses, as well as an understanding of how mobile-friendly courses can impact student success in STEM courses. Three principal outcomes are expected. First is the design of three mobile-friendly course shells with integrated grading for equity approaches intended to close equity gaps in anatomy and physiology, introductory physics, and statistics courses. Second is the completion of a research study that: (i) explores the impact of mobile-friendly course design on student success, (ii) develop understanding of student perspectives of mobile-friendly course design, and (iii) documents the student experiences in mobile-friendly courses. The third outcome is increased visibility and awareness to encourage broader faculty adoption of mobile-accessible courses. <br/><br/>By designing mobile-friendly STEM courses, this project is taking important strides toward designing for equity. Courses will be made freely and widely available on Canvas Commons. To generate interest and awareness of the importance of mobile design, the project will disseminate outcomes on both key components of mobile design and the impact of mobile-friendly courses on student experiences and outcomes. Publication, presentations, and a project website will guide researchers, faculty and instructional designers who are interested in creating mobile-friendly courses or engaging in further study. A mixed-method project evaluation will inform the project's progress towards the HSI Program's aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity for improved STEM learning at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research on: (i) engaged student learning; (ii) insights into what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively; and (iii) improved understanding of how to build institutional capacity for transformation at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying these cooperative interactions requires both surface techniques that are capable of single molecule detection and computational tools for quantifying the degree of interactions. Drs. Chilukuri, Hipps, and Mazur and their students will investigate how single molecules interact with one reactive site and how that system impacts beyond other nearby domains using both experimental and computational methods.

Real-time STM imaging will be used to monitor the reaction between molecules in solution and/or the gas phase and reactive sites on surface supported metal complexes containing two or more reactive sites. Reactivity will be monitored as a function of temperature, reactant concentration, solvation environment, and nature of the support for the metal complexes. Several approaches will be used to model the STM experiments, including the grand canonical ensemble to parameterize the energetics of binding for each distribution over the reactive sites and periodic DFT calculations to provide insight into how electronic distributions affect binding cooperativity at reactive sites.

Collectively, these diseases afflict more than 120 million people and cost more than $580 billion in patient treatments in the US annually. The current standard care of treatments for many of these diseases have variable efficacy and serious side effects. There is increasing interest in modulating the gut microbiome using microbiome therapeutics, i.e., therapeutics comprising living bacteria, as a new generation of drugs for difficult-to-treat diseases. However, the industry currently lacks a reliable approach to systematically and cost-effectively developing effective microbiome therapeutics. Specifically, the largest barrier to microbiome therapeutic development is the lack of predictive preclinical models to translate early-stage research into drug discovery and development.<br/><br/>The proposed project seeks to address the barrier to the use of microbiome therapeutics by developing a first-of-its-kind computational platform, as the first comprehensive, computational, drug design and discovery platform. Currently, the development of microbiome therapeutics is based on a series of experimental and statistical steps that identify the potential microbial strains for target therapeutic candidates in an empirical and iterative process. As a result, this approach requires extensive iterative in vitro and in vivo experiments, which substantially increase the length and cost of the development programs. These challenges have resulted in an inefficient and unpredictable microbiome therapeutic development process, limiting the number of efficacious microbiome therapeutics that could save millions of lives worldwide.

A successful solution which decreases scan times by half will provide improved patient access and care, especially with regard to measuring metabolic activities, brain activity, and cognition.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop high resolution MRI as a powerful tool for understanding metabolic activity in humans and animals. High dielectric constant (HDC) materials provide a low impedance pathway between the patient and magnetic coil of the MRI. The goal of this project is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the MRI by over 50%, thereby cutting the scan time by half.  The HDC materials will have an immediate impact on animal and human behavior studies where neuroscientists are using MRI techniques to monitor brain activity and cognition.  An integrated development approach includes electromagnetic simulation, ceramic processing, and phantom testing.  A working prototype will be tested in clinical MRI scanners thus creating an innovative ecosystem comprised of original equipment manufacturers, hospitals, and researchers with clinical experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While configurability makes software flexible, it can have an impact on software reliability, correctness, usability, performance, and security across all stages of development.  Hence, a large community of researchers are studying ways to explore, sample, predict and reason about configurable systems in multiple sub-disciplines of computer science.  This collaborative planning proposal brings together researchers from Iowa State University and the University of Central Florida to lay the groundwork for a collective research collaborative, A Community for Configurability Open Research and Development (ACCORD), that will help to centralize research on configurability and to create shared approaches, tools and solutions.<br/><br/>The proposal includes activities to survey the research community, create awareness across different sub-disciplines, and document common goals and needs via interaction through workshops and outreach. In addition, activities will develop a common framework, set of tools, and vocabulary, including exemplar artifacts that embody the nature of ACCORD. The final ACCORD infrastructure will provide software tools, models, and solutions that work across different communities, along with tutorials and meta-data information that is not obtainable by only searching the literature. Benchmarks for different types of configurable systems will highlight functional, security and performance challenges.<br/><br/>Concepts on configurability and preliminary ACCORD artifacts will be used in the classroom. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the prototyping of designs and artifacts and will help to build a survey of existing research in configurability. Workshops will be held for different sub-disciplines. Students from the Iowa State first-year honors undergraduate program and the University of Central Florida K-12 Camp Connect will be involved in activities related to this project. The planning will include outreach to non-CISE disciplines, e.g. researchers in the Bioinformatics community, who can benefit from the eventual development of ACCORD.<br/><br/>The project website can be found at: https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/mcohen/accord.

Iron in contact with an oxidant such as oxygen can result in iron oxidation. When iron oxidation occurs in soils, it can lead to the sequestration of nutrients and metals; thus, understanding the mechanisms and controls on iron oxidation is critical. Microorganisms can catalyze iron oxidation, yet the extent of microorganism contribution to oxidation remains relatively unknown. This project evaluates microbial iron oxidation mechanisms (genes/proteins) to help identify when, and how much, microbial iron oxidation is occurring in the environment. This project specifically uses the iron-oxidizing bacterium Leptothrix cholodnii SP-6 to explore new iron-oxidizing mechanisms. The advanced knowledge can be applied to determine controls on iron-oxidizing bacterial activity and how to harness it for bioremediation, water treatment, resource recovery, and other applications. This project trains two graduate students and numerous undergraduates. In addition to public lectures, hands-on activities, and lab tours, a major outreach activity includes ""Microbes in the Wild"" workshops for middle school girls and first-generation college-bound students, who learn about the power of microbes to address environmental challenges. Culturing, genetics, and 'omics research tasks are being incorporated into college classes as multi-week experiential learning units.<br/><br/>A new genetic system in the heterotrophic iron-oxidizing bacterium Leptothrix cholodnii SP-6 provides an unprecedented opportunity to reveal new iron oxidation mechanisms. L. cholodnii SP-6 is easily culturable and its genome has numerous predicted metal oxidation genes including genes for multiheme cytochromes and multicopper oxidases with homologs in other iron oxidizers. Yet, the genome is missing well-known iron oxidase genes, making L. cholodnii SP-6 a good model organism to investigate novel iron oxidation mechanisms. This project is using a combination of culturing, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, genetics, and microscopy to determine the iron oxidation mechanisms in Leptothrix, notably SP-6. The research aims include (1) discover candidate iron oxidation genes in L. cholodnii SP-6 via transposon sequencing (TnSeq), transcriptomics, and proteomics. A high throughput pipeline for culturing and assaying iron oxidation is being developed so that as many genes as possible can be screened. (2) Explore the environmental diversity and frequency of Leptothrix iron oxidation genes via isolation and genomic characterization of new Leptothrix spp. followed by comparative genomics study. (3) Validate iron oxidation genes in L. cholodnii SP-6 via genetic methods of knockout and complementation. (4) Determine the role of iron oxidation proteins in biomineralization by labeling and localizing key iron oxidation proteins and imaging cells and biominerals by confocal and electron microscopy. Together, these approaches will establish a larger set of iron oxidation genes/proteins while understanding how these catalyze formation of environmentally important iron oxyhydroxide biominerals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials have a wide range of applications, including but not limited to preventing the interference of aircraft digital instruments, mitigating signal jamming, enhancing the performance of wireless devices, and safeguarding control of electronics for power grid systems. Most of the electromagnetic shields that are widely used at present rely mainly on reflecting the incident waves, which can result in secondary pollution. This Faculty Early Career Development project will combine experimental and computational studies to investigate how the molecular interactions between charge-containing polymers and two-dimensional carbides MXenes can be utilized to create functional materials with tunable electromagnetic wave absorption. This project will develop a science-based connection between the chemistry of charged macromolecules and MXenes and the mechanisms by which they interact, and form intricate, hierarchical nanoscale structures. In addition, this project will provide opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as STEM teachers, to engage in hands-on experiments and workshops. The project also involves curriculum development related to the synthesis, characterization, and application of hybrid functional materials based on nanoscale interactions. Regional research symposia on two-dimensional materials will also be organized to facilitate knowledge-sharing among the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>The integration of MXenes and charged polymers within three-dimensional hybrid structures presents an enticing prospect for developing hybrid materials with adjustable mechanical and electrochemical properties. Nevertheless, creating such three-dimensional assemblies can prove difficult due to the complex surface chemistry of MXenes, which can result in uncontrolled interactions and, ultimately, aggregation. A key challenge in the field of MXene nanomaterials is gaining a fundamental understanding of these interactions and discovering methods to manipulate them effectively. This CAREER project addresses this challenge by integrating experimental and computational modeling through three interconnected research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on comprehending the nanoscale interactions between MXenes and polyelectrolytes, while the second thrust aims to exploit these interactions to direct the 3D bottom-up assembly. The third thrust involves the bottom-up structural modulation of electromagnetic wave absorption. The dynamics of assembly and the development of morphology and composition will be studied at multiple length scales. The regulation of morphology is accomplished by managing the conformation of the adsorbed polymer chains on MXene nanosheets, which controls the nanostructure of the MXene-polyelectrolyte heterointerface. The impact of various molecular characteristics of polyelectrolytes and MXenes, as well as hydrodynamic forces, on their interactions at heterointerfaces and the assembly of MXenes-polyelectrolyte into hybrid structures will be explored. This project will also demonstrate how controlling the interface nanostructure can lead to the creation of hybrid materials with improved microwave absorption, which arises from tunable electrical conductivity and interfacial polarization. The fundamental knowledge obtained from this research has the potential to inform the development of other MXene-based hybrids for applications in antimicrobial materials and water treatment. This project will integrate research, teaching, and outreach initiatives to advance scientific innovation while educating and inspiring a diverse, inclusive group of future STEM students and researchers.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the CBET Nanoscale Interactions Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include a broad spectrum of human-made products, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and consumer products. Their deleterious impacts on humans and the environment often become apparent only after such compounds have become distributed widely in air, water, and soils. This is to a significant extent due to their degradation in the environment to form unanticipated products that are more toxic than the parent compound. The focus of this project is on compounds that contain nitrogen. The goals are to measure how fast selected members of this group, which includes pesticides and pharmaceuticals, degrade on contact with atmospheric constituents, and to identify the products that are formed. The data generated in this project will form the core needed to assess how these synthetic chemicals are degraded under atmospheric conditions. Through a partnership with a local environmental justice community group, high school students from historically disadvantaged communities will join the team to work in their labs during the summer. The proposed research will also provide training to undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows in the integration of experiment and theory to address current important environmental problems.<br/><br/>Two different environmentally relevant oxidation systems will be explored: hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation from the top down, representing gas phase OH impinging on a solid, and OH oxidation from the bottom up, representing oxidation of an adsorbed organic by OH generated from a nitrite ion or TiO2 substrate. Top-down studies will probe the oxidation of thin films of the organics using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy or in situ oxidation of organic particles in a flow system. Bottom-up studies will use OH from photolysis of solid nitrite salts or TiO2 in the presence of water. Loss of the organics and formation of products will be monitored using IR, UV and a variety of mass spectrometric techniques. The structures of the strongest binding complexes between OH and the organics will be predicted using semi-empirical quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations will be applied to each of these complexes in order to provide insights into the molecular basis for the experimental results.

This project will partner with autistic STEM majors enrolled on partner campuses and empower them to design campus resources, with the help of STEM faculty and student services staff. These new resources will deepen their engagement with their STEM fields, provide opportunities to develop and pursue their STEM career interests, and establish meaningful and lasting peer and mentor relationships. The number of autistic young people seeking college degrees continues to increase and universities are not prepared to harness the strengths and interests that autistic students can contribute to their campus communities. This project is significant because it employs and fully involves autistic STEM majors from the design through the implementation of this project. A collaborative team of researchers, campus faculty and staff, and autistic undergraduates will develop and pilot campus programs and activities aimed at better supporting autistic students on campus, and evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and activities after a semester-long pilot period. A broader impact of this project includes the dissemination of programs and activities to other campuses nationwide, specifically public institutions similar to those within the CSU who serve a diverse array of students, many of whom are low-income and first-generation college degree seekers. Of note, this project will use identity-first language (i.e. ?autistic person?) throughout as autistic self-advocates and recent research indicates that this is preferred by the autistic community. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to improve the undergraduate learning experience for autistic students pursuing STEM majors. Not only will the programs produced by this project directly benefit autistic students, but autistic students at three CSU campuses will be employed as research partners and co-developers of programs on their campuses throughout the project. Driven by student needs and interests identified during interviews and focus groups held in Year 1, a team of researchers, campus faculty and staff, and autistic undergraduates will develop and pilot programs aimed at improving student learning and engagement in Year 2. Project staff will conduct pre- and post-intervention interviews and surveys to evaluate semester-long pilot programs, generate recommendations for future program development, and disseminate findings with the goal of improving undergraduate education for autistic STEM students within the CSU and beyond. Four objectives will guide this two-year project. First is to understand the existing support landscape for autistic STEM undergraduates at three partner CSU campuses. Second is to identify gaps in available CSU campus programs from the perspective of autistic students, faculty, staff, and administrators and make recommendations to fill these gaps. Third is to iteratively develop, implement, and evaluate pilot campus programs and experiences for autistic STEM students and professional development for faculty and staff. Fourth, and finally, is to prepare to expand campus partnerships to additional universities by synthesizing recommendations based on findings from pilot program implementation.

The total addressable market for all telehealth point of care tests (beyond strep throat) in urgent care and primary care is $10.4 billion. This solution impacts antibiotic overprescribing and economics of health services. Currently, 34% of children and 75% of adults with pharyngitis receive unnecessary antibiotics, and this is 10-21% worse with telehealth. A remote point of care prediction for strep throat can potentially reduce the $22 million/year costs in unnecessary antibiotics and reduce drivers for drug-resistant bacteria. When pharyngitis is treated on telehealth it saves patients up to 1-3 hours per clinical visit and saves health insurance companies up to $100-400 per visit, compared to an emergency room or urgent care facility.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the field of machine learning by combining smartphone image analysis and deep learning.

This project provides partial support for the Gordon<br/>Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Coastal Ocean Dynamics, to be held at the Bryant University on June 17-23, 2023. The financial support from NSF will be used to support the attendance of students, postdocs, early career researchers, invited speakers and discussion leaders, and to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants. Coastal oceans play a major role in the Earth?s system for reasons such as transforming nutrient-rich and often polluted freshwater discharge from land and dissipating large amounts of tidal energy. Understanding the processes in the coastal ocean offers great promise for linking scientific research to societal needs and to anthropogenic impact in the global ocean. Studying the interconnectedness of the physical, geological, chemical, and biological aspects of the coastal oceans is fundamental to developing sound practices for the protection of the marine ecosystem and public health. The 2023 GRC and GRS on Coastal Ocean Dynamics strives to provide a platform to foster communication on interdisciplinary thinking and nurture rapport between senior researchers and students/junior researchers. It is organized with a special emphasis on diversity and equity in gender balance, URM community representation and international participation to provide a better range of perspectives on the scientific topics. Besides the regular conference communication, there will be a structured ?Power Hour? event focused specifically on different aspects diversity and equity. The 2023 GRC and GRS on Coastal Ocean Dynamics will continue a long-standing record of informing and inspiring researchers that will ultimately comprise the technically skilled and creative research workforce required to meet future challenges in applied coastal ocean dynamics research.<br/><br/>The theme of the 2023 GRC on Coastal Ocean Dynamics is coastal ocean physics and its connections to marine ecosystems, and the associated GRS, a 2-day seminar before the GRC, targets professional development of students and early career scientists.

There is significant evidence that interactions of nitrate with sunlight can change the composition of the atmosphere in ways that can lead to poor air quality or influence cloud formation. The chemical mechanisms involved are still not well understood. Laboratory experiments will be carried out on well-characterized models of soil, sea salt and aerosols using sensitive instrumentation that follows chemical reactions in real time and under real environmental conditions. This research will help clarify how pollutants in the atmosphere are formed and destroyed, with potential long terms scientific relevance to the causes of air pollution, particularly, to the nature of oxidized nitrogen species that might obtain in the atmosphere from nitrate chemistry. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this research. The latter will include entering first-year students from underrepresented groups who will carry out summer research projects designed to increase their interest in pursuing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors. In addition, the outcomes of this project will be used in outreach activities to enhance science education at a local high school.<br/><br/>Under this award, the research team led by Jonathan Ruff at Indiana University will study the photochemical reactivity of nitric acid, nitrate, and organic nitrates on environmental surfaces with a focus on elucidating chemical mechanisms leading to the release and recycling of nitrogen oxides and chlorine atom precursors that contribute to the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. Experimental approaches will involve UV-visible and infrared diffuse reflection spectroscopy, and photochemical flow reactors with gas phase product detection by chemical ionization mass spectrometry and chemiluminescence analysis. In addition to revealing mechanisms of nitrogen oxide and chlorine recycling, the project will provide the kinetics and photochemical data needed to advance the ability to model and predict multiphase photochemistry of oxidized nitrogen. The long term broader scientific impacts of this research include providing a more complete reaction tree emanating from atmospheric nitrates with a particular focus on the constellation of oxidized nitrogen species that is produced photochemically upon interaction with UV/vis light from the sun.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These SST changes affect the global atmospheric circulation and thus induce long-range impacts including changes in the severity of winters in Canada, the distribution of rainfall in the Asian monsoon, and Atlantic hurricane activity.  These worldwide impacts have motivated intensive efforts to develop ENSO prediction systems, which show some promise but so far have had mixed results.<br/><br/>Here the PIs hypothesize that the mixed success of ENSO predictions is intrinsic to ENSO, meaning that some ENSO events are in fact more predictable than others.

The Principal Investigators (PIs) are particularly concerned with the skill of ENSO predictions made before the onset of the event, which are skillful to the extent that ENSO events develop from some form of preconditioning such as the buildup of heat in the subsurface equatorial ocean.  Model simulations conducted previously by the PIs suggest that preconditioning is not a necessary condition for ENSO events, which can initiate rapidly starting from neutral conditions.  Such events, arising purely from the chaotic growth of very small initial perturbations of the atmosphere-ocean system, would be inherently unpredictable.  But the PIs argue that some forms of preconditioning can render the system less susceptible to noise-level perturbations and instead drive the evolution of an El Nino or La Nina event in a deterministic manner, allowing skillful predictions several months ahead of the onset.<br/><br/>The PIs test their hypothesis through numerical simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM).  The work takes advantage of procedures they have developed for strictly controlling the state of the equatorial Pacific in CESM simulations, so that various forms of preconditioning can be imposed or excluded.

More than 95% of chemical industry products derive from a small slate of molecular building blocks that are relevant to more than 30% of the GNP of the United States.  It is the central thesis of this project that recent conceptual advances in oxidative chemical and biochemical catalysis, and the interplay of emerging experimental techniques and modern theory, offer unprecedented opportunities to develop inexpensive, earth-abundant transition metals as catalysts for these selective processes. The project combines knowledge of biocatalysis used by microorganisms with insights derived from synthetic systems to provide a conceptual basis to understand these processes. Broad application of this chemistry will have high impact on the nation?s and the world?s chemical and energy economies. The Groves group will continue to serve as an effective training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, especially women and members of under-represented groups in science. <br/><br/>In this project, Professor Groves aims to develop new methods for the catalytic oxygenation, fluorination and halogenation of C-H bonds. The development of novel and efficient oxidative processes requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of metal-mediated atom transfer by observing the unitary processes of catalysis, also including a range of metal-halogen species, and elucidating the nature of their reactions with organic substrates. In particular, the proposed research strives to elaborate a conceptual basis for heteroatom rebound catalysis, which can be dissected in a manner similar to hydrogen atom transfer. The project will integrate small molecule chemical catalysts with insights from metalloenzymes and biocatalytic processes. Nature employs iron proteins to achieve C-H hydroxylations and halogenations. Through analogy, the redox chemistry of Fe, Mn, Co and other abundant transition metals will add significantly to our fundamental understanding of reactive metal species, of the utility of new kinetic probes, and likely afford a deeper understanding of electronic structure and of the power of computation.  In the end, this work is expected to offer opportunities to realize a detailed quantitative and predictive understanding of oxidative catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among its most significant applications are partial differential equations (PDEs) which, in conjunction with their analysis and numerical algorithms, represent some of the most powerful tools humanity has ever developed for understanding the material world. However, increasingly complex mathematical models arising from physics, biology, and chemistry challenge the efficacy of first-principle-based approaches for solving practical problems, such as those in fluid turbulence, molecular dynamics, and large-scale inverse problems. A major obstacle for numerical algorithms is the so-called curse of dimensionality.  Fueled by advances in Graphics Processing Unit and Tensor Processing Unit general-purpose computing, deep neural networks (DNNs) and deep learning approaches excel in combating the curse of dimensionality and demonstrate immense potential for solving complex problems in science and engineering. This project aims to investigate how mathematical structures within a problem can inform the design and analysis of innovative DNNs, particularly in the context of inverse problems where unknown parameters are inferred from measurements, such as electrical impedance tomography. Additionally, the programming component in this project will focus on training the next generation of computational mathematicians.<br/><br/>The Operator Learning (OpL) framework in deep learning provides a unique perspective for tackling challenging and potentially ill-posed PDE-based problems. This project will explore the potential of OpL to mitigate the ill-posedness of many inverse problems, as its powerful approximation capability combined with offline training and online prediction properties lead to high-quality, rapid reconstructions. The project seeks to bridge OpL and classical methodologies by integrating mathematical structures from classical problem-solving approaches into DNN architectures. In particular, the project will shed light on the mathematical properties of the attention mechanism, the backbone of state-of-the-art DNN Transformers, such as those in GPT and AlphaFold 2.  Furthermore, the project will examine the flexibility of attention neural architectures, enabling the fusion of attention mechanisms with important methodologies in applied mathematics, such as Galerkin projection or Fredholm integral equations, in accordance with the a priori mathematical structure of a problem. This project will also delve into the mathematical foundations of attention through the lens of spectral theory in Hilbert spaces, seeking to understand how the emblematic query-key-value architecture contributes to the rich representational power and diverse approximation capabilities of Transformers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, many students fail to reach their potential in these skills. One of the challenges that preschool-aged children face when acquiring an understanding of numbers is distinguishing between numerical magnitudes (like three elephants) and spatial magnitudes (like the size of an elephant). Prior research suggests that children often focus on the size of the objects instead of the exact number of objects (for example, when comparing 3 elephants to 6 mice, children often mistakenly say that there is a greater number of elephants than mice). The ability to flexibly pay attention to both numerical and spatial magnitudes and then determine which magnitudes are relevant for a given situation is referred to as ?flexible attention to magnitudes? (FAM). This project aims to understand the development of young children?s flexible attention to magnitudes skill and how it can best be supported by specific experiences in early childhood. It is hypothesized that this skill is essential to later mathematical thinking and is an important skill for many mathematical activities, such as number line estimation and proportional reasoning.<br/><br/>The proposed studies are designed to identify specific mechanisms that lead to improvements in flexible attention to magnitudes (FAM) skills. The first aim of these studies is to examine the roles of mathematical language and visual experience as potential causal mechanisms that drive improvement in this skill in young children. The second aim is to determine whether improving flexible attention to magnitudes skill has a causal effect on mathematics achievement. The third aim is to test whether an intervention leads to durable improvements in flexible attention to magnitudes skill and mathematics achievement, and far transfer to executive function skills. The fourth aim is to explore whether the impact of flexible attention to magnitudes instruction depends on students? socioeconomic status (SES) and initial number word knowledge. These aims will be tested with young children ages 3 - 5 years via three experimenter-led studies using pretest-intervention-posttest designs. Each study will compare reading books with specific types of FAM content to each other and to an active control. Study 1 will test the effects of mathematical language and Study 2 will examine the role of visual experience on FAM skill and mathematics achievement. Study 3 will examine gains in FAM skill and mathematics achievement at a delayed post-test, and far transfer to executive function skills. Study 4 will pool data from Studies 2 and 3 to provide a well-powered test of SES and number knowledge as moderators of the effects of FAM intervention. These studies will build a theoretical model of how FAM skill develops and impacts other skills, while simultaneously laying the foundation for larger-scale interventions aimed at improving children?s mathematics skills.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

Traditional examinations of rational choice theory have assumed that would-be criminals prefer crime and therefore only calculate its costs and benefits to decide whether to commit it. However, little is known about how the full, more nuanced decision process (from decision sciences) plays out in actual criminal incidents or how it is shaped by living in areas of concentrated disadvantage that contribute to high rates of community violence. This omission can distort how we view offenders and produce less effective policy based on faulty assumptions. The overarching goal of this EAGER project is to unpack the black box of the decision process as it unfolds in incidents of violence among youth living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. This basic science can advance understanding of all forms of crime by drawing on insights from those navigating the real-world contexts associated with crime to understand the role of neighborhoods in the decision process. In addition to these theoretical insights, this project will inform efforts to reduce youth violence through decision aiding that targets specific components of the decision process and by seeking to change the contexts that produce such outcomes. The impact of this work will be enhanced by providing students and a postdoctoral fellow with research and professional development opportunities, partnering with a community advisory board from the communities most impacted by community violence, and creating a technical advisory board to inform the dissemination plan.<br/><br/>To achieve project goals, the research team will collect data from multiple interviews with youth ages 18 to 24 residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Lansing, Michigan, to examine how the decision process operates during violent incidents and the contextual influences on it. Interview protocols will be derived using inductive and deductive techniques, and a coding scheme will be developed to construct mental models of youth?s decision process and its neighborhood influences. Completion of this work will produce an updated choice framework to the field of Criminology to improve understanding of decision-making and violence and inform related policies that largely respond to crime as though it is unrelated to the social milieu in which it occurs. It is imperative that we address this problematic aspect of criminological theory, as current policies (e.g., mass incarceration) are detrimental to an already marginalized segment of society (i.e., young Black males) for whom we tend to overlook the complexity of decision processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its prevalence, the complexity of the underlying processes in a flame still represents a challenge for scientists and engineers, especially considering the need for more stringent regulations for harmful emissions, uncontrolled fires, and climate change mitigation.  To simplify the analysis of practical burners, it is common to employ reduced sets of physical and chemical processes retaining essential characteristics of the overall phenomenon.  However, such an approach often oversimplifies relevant combustion attributes by neglecting the effect of curvature and stretch inherent to real-world flames.  Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the influence of topography and stretch on combustion and sooting characteristics of non-uniformly curved flames.  Results from the proposed investigation will generate data for combustion model development and validation to advance power and heat generation technologies to sustain U.S. energy security using clean fuels and its position as a global leader in sustainability.  The project will also allow students from CSUN, a Master?s Hispanic Serving Institution, to participate in cutting-edge research and develop skillsets critical for preparing the future workforce in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The proposed work will detail the effect of topography and stretch of non-uniformly curved non-premixed flame structures in their combustion and sooting characteristics.  To this end, this project will study stretched curved flames to provide: (1) novel non-premixed counterflow configurations with non-uniform curvature; (2) experimental data detailing stretch and non-uniform curvature influence on the flame structure, stability, temperature, soot formation, and extinction; (3) a simplified theoretical framework for the description of stretched non-premixed flames with non-uniform curvature.  New non-premixed opposed-flow experimental burners employing quadric surfaces, and combinations thereof, will be developed to produce flame topographies equivalent to those observed in flame elements from practical combustion systems.  Particle image velocimetry will be used for fluid flow characterization, whereas soot and thin filament pyrometry will be employed to determine soot formation and flame temperature.  Simplified reacting flow models based on potential flow solutions and infinitely fast chemistry will be developed to describe curvature effects on overall flame characteristics theoretically.

Despite great progress in studying TC development over the last several decades, our current understanding of TC processes is still inadequate. A direct consequence of this lack of understanding of TC formation is our limited capability in predicting TC formation in practice. Thus, improving the understanding of TC formation processes and TC subsequent development is of significance for both the advance of science and social safety and risk management. Using numerical simulations along with recent machine learning techniques, this project introduces a new approach to TC research that can help unfold the dominant mechanisms underlying TC formation in different ocean basins. Unlike the traditional vortex tracking methods in the current TC research and operation, the approach in this project offers an alternative way to search for new environmental factors governing TC formation. By exploring the practicality of these machine learning methods for TC research, this project will not only introduce an innovative way of studying tropical cyclogenesis but also help train a new generation of workforce in the area of artificial intelligence applications for atmospheric research. <br/><br/>This project combines several new modelling and machine learning methods to investigate two key scientific questions: 1) what are the key environmental factors that control different TC formation pathways in different ocean basins, and 2) whether global tropical cyclogenesis possesses an episodic development, and if so, what environmental factors determine the frequency of this global TC formation. Using a combination of model simulations, physical diagnostic analyses, and machine learning algorithms, this project will look into major environmental conditions and their dynamical constraints in the tropical atmosphere that are insufficiently represented in the current TC genesis potential index framework. These environmental constraints will help determine different favorable conditions for TC formation and how to use these factors for studying the shift of TC climatology in the past and future climates. The outcomes from this project will also bring more insights into the physical mechanisms behind the maximum capacity of the tropical atmosphere in generating TCs annually in our current Earth?s atmosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Regional manufacturers in northeast Wisconsin are interested in new academic pathways for technicians to meet this growing demand in the region. Competency-based education (CBE) addresses industry technician needs by preparing skilled students to enter the workforce with less difficulty than traditional credit-based instructional delivery modes. Lakeshore Technical College has been a state-wide leader in the implementation of CBE for technical education programs. CBE is an instructional model in which students, learning at their own pace, demonstrate that they have achieved a high level of competency for a specific set of skills that are valued by industry. This project will develop and implement a dual enrollment program for high school students at a new charter school to help students achieve competencies with maintenance, Industry 4.0, and welding technologies. Professional development for high school teachers will provide an opportunity for teachers to earn industry-recognized certifications for training students in advanced manufacturing technologies. Recruiting activities for high school students in the region will provide opportunities for students to learn about technician careers, work-based learning programs, and advanced manufacturing technologies. The project should be of interest to the technical education community as it will advance knowledge about how to implement CBE in technical education and how mastery of concepts can be used for high school students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to address the critical demand in the region for skilled advanced manufacturing technicians by pursuing three objectives. First is to create a CBE dual enrollment program in advanced manufacturing in consultation with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT). Second is to train instructors in the use of advanced manufacturing technologies with CBE. Third is to recruit high school students to increase the pipeline of technicians with an emphasis on students from underrepresented groups. The BILT will review and evaluate the advanced manufacturing curriculum to ensure that the competencies within the maintenance, Industry 4.0, and welding pathways represent the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for advanced manufacturing technician positions. Community college faculty will serve as mentors for charter school instructors and serve as a class resource during instruction until charter school instructors complete required certifications and are able to independently deliver all coursework in each educational pathway. Recruitment activities for high school students will include an annual marketing plan, bootcamps, and events in collaboration with regional organizations to help students understand the career opportunities in advanced manufacturing. The impact of the project on student engagement in the program will be assessed using institutional data, online surveys, and focus groups. The CBE model and project results will be shared and disseminated through the Wisconsin Resource Center for charter schools, ATE Central, and the ATE PI Conference. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A widespread and very useful framework for studying both of these tasks is provided by probabilistic graphical models.  This framework originates in statistical physics, and physical intuition has guided both the development of algorithms and the understanding of computational complexity.  A common setting in both practical and scientific applications is the imposition of global constraints on a graphical model; examples including fixing the number of interacting particles in a system, fixing magnetization in a mathematical model of a magnet, or fixing the sizes of a partition of elements.  A rigorous understanding of the performance of algorithms in this setting is still largely absent. The goal of this project is to develop new techniques in algorithms and complexity to understand how global constraints influence the tractability of these sampling and optimization problems.  Guided by insights from statistical physics, this research project will develop new algorithms and study the limits of algorithmic approaches. The project also involves the training of graduate students in interdisciplinary research and a high-school outreach program.<br/><br/>The main research goal of the project is to build a robust theory of sampling and optimization in the presence of global constraints in several algorithmic contexts: computational thresholds for approximate counting and sampling; Markov chain mixing times; and the structure of optimization problems on random graphs.  Preliminary work shows that imposing a global constraint on a Markov random field can transform the behavior and complexity of the associated sampling and optimization problems.  Specific problems the project focuses on include the determination of computational thresholds for the antiferromagnetic Ising model at fixed magnetization on bounded degree graphs; proving optimal mixing time bounds for conservative dynamics like the Kawasaki dynamics; and understanding the limiting values of optimization problems on sparse random graphs.  The approach is guided by intuition from statistical physics, a field that provides a natural language and suite of techniques for analyzing graphical models and a wealth of examples of different phenomena that result from imposing global constraints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While ET graduates often work alongside engineers and there may be little distinction between their entry-level job descriptions, many encounter barriers to career advancement in the hierarchical engineering field because of their chosen degree path. In addition, the disproportionately large number of Black students in some engineering technology programs compared to engineering directly impacts the number of Black students   who later have the degree credentials often required to enter to the engineering professorate, engineering research careers, and leadership positions in industry. This study will center on the voices, experiences, and knowledge of Black ET students through focus group interviews and surveys in order to gain insight into the factors that led them to their chosen major and their experiences as Black students in ET. The project will also compare the engineering and ET programs at the collaborating institutions and examine whether there are certain engineering majors that are less accessible than others, and whether Black students are concentrated in some ET majors more than others.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this work is to contribute to the identification and removal of systemic and structural barriers and racial inequities in ET undergraduate education. The long-term goal is that the findings of the research will be used to inform interventions and policy changes. Investigating the reasons why there is a disproportionately high percentage of Black students in ET compared to engineering will shed light on the complex social terrain that Black students must navigate to combat the structural barriers in education to achieve an undergraduate college degree generally, and an engineering-related degree specifically, with all of the professional benefits a degree confers. The specific research questions of the project are as follows: 1. What role do high school counselors, college counselors/recruiters, and faculty play in Black students? choice of ET versus engineering? 2. What are the academic and structural barriers that effect Black students? admittance to engineering? 3. What are the structural barriers and affordances that enable or prevent Black students to transfer from ET to engineering (and vice versa) from during an undergraduate program? 4. How do Black ET students perceive their future career opportunities? 5. To what extent do Black ET students identify with the Engineering and/or ET domain and how is this related to contextual salience of stereotype threat and belongingness to the program? 6. How do students? perceptions of their experiences in ET and the interpretation of these experiences relate to their self-schemas including their expectations of success, personal, cultural, and professional identities, and their career goals? This project will contribute to efforts to develop a more diverse STEM workforce by examining how these complexities influence student choice of major and suggesting solutions to lessen their impacts.<br/><br/>This collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EDU Racial Equity). The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Today's diversity of plant and animal forms observable in nature arises from accumulated morphological innovations. Despite the scientific interest in this topic, the evolutionary processes that give rise to new forms are still surrounded by mystery and debate. One promising model is genetic assimilation, in which new forms that have emerged from environmentally induced variation (phenotypic plasticity), can later become genetically determined. However, it remains unclear how such a switch from environmental to genetic control might occur. This project aims to characterize the molecular mechanisms facilitating genetic assimilation, to further our understanding of morphological novelty, diversity, and evolution. As a study system, the fellow will utilize the pea aphid, in which a female form variation has been genetically assimilated in males by changes in their DNA. <br/><br/>Pea aphids produce two types of wingless morphs: asexual wingless females induced by maternal environment (wing polyphenism, a type of phenotypic plasticity), and genetically determined wingless males (genetic assimilation). Importantly, the shorthand term ""wingless"" used here describes not only a loss of wings, but a systemic change in metabolic, behavioral, and multiple morphological character states. Thus, ""wingless"" pea aphid morphs comprise a bona fide example of phenotypic novelty. Two duplicates of the gene follistatin (fs), a TGF-beta ligand inhibitor, are separately involved in male and female wingless morph determination. The duplicate fs2 is upregulated in wingless females, while the presence of the fs3 duplicate determines wingless male morphs. Both duplicates exhibit changes to their protein coding and putative regulatory regions. The fellow will use cutting edge experimental techniques to characterize changes in cis-regulation (Aim 1), signatures of selection (Aim 2), and protein function (Aim 3) at fs paralogs, to determine how duplication and divergence facilitated genetic assimilation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low temperature plasmas are partially ionized gases, comprising of electrons, ions and neutral molecules.  Small solid particles, or dust, introduced in a low temperature plasma can get charged and become suspended against the force of gravity.  Dusty plasmas are common in space, such as tails of comets and the rings of Saturn, and in the semiconductor industry, where dusty plasmas can form during manufacturing of computer chips.  Control of floating and moving dust is a challenge for both fundamental plasma physics studies and the industrial applications.  This collaborative project allows the development of a novel method to trap dust particles in plasmas by combining cutting-edge optical and laser diagnostic techniques at Mississippi State University with advanced dusty plasma systems at Auburn University.  The project also provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students from historically excluded communities to obtain hands-on plasma science experience geared toward industrial applications.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will address one of the key challenges in the field of dusty plasmas: ?Tuning of plasma - dust grain interactions for precision control of trajectories and growth of nanometer and micrometer size particles? as stated in the 2020 Decadal Assessment of Plasma Science. A novel optical trapping technology will be designed to actively pin down single dust particles in the plasma and to transport them in a controlled way anywhere in the device. In addition, multifold laser diagnostic techniques will be used to measure the impacted plasma parameters resulting from physical and chemical processes, thus aiding understanding of particle-plasma interactions, particle charging behavior, and particle growth in a reactive dusty plasma at the microscopic level. The single-particle dusty plasma diagnostic techniques developed in this project can be readily adopted to other dusty plasmas such as magnetized dusty plasma, and for plasma fabrication and control in the industry. The synergy of the expertise of the collaborating research groups both enables fundamental dusty plasma research at a deeper level with unprecedented precision, and provides a new platform to grow future workforce in laser-based diagnostics and plasma physics at two NSF EPSCoR jurisdictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology is based upon the direct measurement of the filter status using photosensors, smart signal processing algorithms for accurate filter soiling condition determination using the sensor data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for control and communication. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""Ambient air pollution kills about 3 million people annually... About 90 percent of the world's population is exposed to levels exceeding WHO limits."" While air-filtration technology alone cannot solve the overwhelming problem of ambient air pollution, it must be an integral part of a comprehensive solution. With data driven decision making to eliminate premature filter replacement and to reduce costs, the proposed technology will propel the usage of high-quality filters more ubiquitously, leading to enhanced public health. With 150 million heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in operation, and quarterly filter replacement, an estimated 600 million filters are manufactured and thrown away every year. A reduction of 50% of the filter waste will have a significant positive impact on the environment because of reduced manufacturing and waste.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will leverage the accuracy of photosensors in detecting the degree of filter blockage by sensing transmitted light through the filter. Underlying the seemingly straightforward solution is a set of complex technical challenges. Due to the uneven structure including pleats and frame obstructions, the sensor data are inherently noisy. A software-controlled actuator will place the sensor in front of the filter and take data from multiple locations of the filter. A smart algorithm will be developed to extract a parameter from the analysis of the data set that would be an accurate proxy for the particle size removal efficiency defined in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard which in turn is expected to be a sufficiently accurate indicator of the true filter age. Using the IoT capability, the sensor data will be collected in the cloud, where the smart algorithm and control software will be stored. The final objective is to determine the optimum point for filter replacement by comparing the parameter with a threshold parameter derived from a predetermined maximum particle size removal efficiency and airflow resistance based on indoor air quality requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The frequencies of ULF waves overlap with the range of drift frequencies of energetic electrons as they circle the Earth, leading to resonant interactions.  Numerous expressions have been derived to quantitatively describe radial diffusion so that they can be incorporated into global models of radiation belt electrons.  However, most expressions of the radial diffusion rates are derived only for equatorially mirroring electrons and are based on estimates of the power of ULF waves that are obtained either from spacecraft close to the equatorial plane or from the ground.  Recent studies using the Van Allen Probes and Arase have shown that the wave power in magnetic fluctuations is significantly enhanced away from the magnetic equator, consistent with models simulating the natural modes of oscillation of magnetospheric field lines.  This has significant implications for the estimation of radial diffusion rates, as higher pitch angle electrons will experience considerably higher ULF wave fluctuations than equatorial electrons.  This project will derive the magnetic and electric field wave powers and incorporate them into the 3D test particle simulations to estimate the diffusion coefficient.  The novel, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion rates will be introduced to a global model of radiation belt electrons to evaluate the effect of the pitch-angle dependence of the diffusion coefficient on radiation belt dynamics.  The result could have significant implications for the radial diffusion rates as currently estimated.  It will pave the way for incorporating pitch-angle-dependent radial diffusion coefficients in global models to predict the near-Earth radiation environment better.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the role of off-equatorial Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves on the radial transport and diffusion of relativistic electrons (100s keV to few MeV) in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7), investigating the effect of pitch-angle-dependent radial transport of energetic particles on global dynamics of the radiation belts. The following science questions will be answered: How are ULF electric and magnetic field fluctuations distributed in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time under varying solar and geomagnetic conditions? What is the role of off-equatorial ULF wave fluctuations on the radial diffusion and transport of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7)? How are off-equatorial ULF waves expected to impact current radiation belt models, and what is their contribution to the global dynamics of the radiation belts?

The students range from early-stage graduate students to tenured professors, with backgrounds in areas including genetics, molecular and cellular biology, bioinformatics, engineering, and physics.<br/><br/>Since their foundation in the 1970s and early 1980s, the CSHL summer courses on Advanced Bacterial Genetics, Yeast Genetics & Genomics and Frontiers & techniques in Plant Science (collectively, the Model Genetics Systems courses) have each played a critical role in disseminating new approaches and techniques to the broad scientific community interested in the use of model systems in genetics and genomics. The proposed courses (2023-2025) will continue this tradition by providing advanced training in the fundamentals of working in these model systems making use of classical genetic and molecular biological approaches, analysis of genetic interactions, and genomics. The courses each consist of hands-on laboratory modules, a vigorous lecture series, technical presentations and demonstrations, and informal discussions. The instructors and invited speakers, acknowledged leaders in their fields, present up-to-the-moment research on a wide range of topics. The informal, highly interactive course format allows students and teaching apprentices to learn from each other as well as from the instructors and invited speakers. In sum, the courses provide for intensive three-week immersion into cross-disciplinary and cutting-edge approaches, helping prepare the next generation of microbiologists and plant scientists to apply the latest genetic/genomic tools and approaches to their own research, often in non-model and ?real world? applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continuous innovation of rechargeable batteries that supply power to an electric motor is required to boost the adoption of EVs since the battery significantly affects the driving range, safety, and cost of EVs. A lithium/sulfur (Li/S) battery consisting of a lithium metal anode and sulfur cathode is a promising candidate for EV applications as it has the potential for a five-times longer driving distance at a given weight of the EV battery compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. The major challenges towards the development of reliable and safe Li/S batteries are 1) the need to mitigate problematic issues associated with chemical compounds called lithium polysulfides, which are formed in the organic liquid electrolyte during battery operation, and 2) the flammable ionic conductor used as electrolyte. A Li/S solid-state battery is a promising system for overcoming these issues because it uses a solid-state electrolyte which is non-flammable and can prevent polysulfide formation better than liquid electrolytes. However Li/S solid-state batteries suffer from poor energy storage/delivery performance due to an insufficient understanding of the electrode-solid electrolyte interface. This project will conduct fundamental studies on the interfaces in Li/S solid-state batteries, advanced materials characterization methods, and implement rational electrode design to address these challenges. The results from this project will create new knowledge that can enable energy storage solutions to meet the U.S.?s mission toward decarbonizing the global automotive sector and shaping the sustainable energy future. Comprehensive education and workforce development plans are laid out through a seamless partnership between Arizona State University and the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. Training graduate and undergraduate students via this research project will significantly contribute to the mission of both universities mission to become a hotbed of energy technologies.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to improve the understanding of the electrochemical processes taking place in Li/S composite cathodes employing garnet-type lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (Li7La3Zr2O12, LLZO) as a solid electrolyte. The research will focus on: 1) Obtaining an improved understanding of the reaction mechanisms in Li/S composite cathodes using model systems, electroanalytical techniques, and in operando/ex-situ X-ray analyses, 2) Elucidation of fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic parameters influential in the electrochemical processes of sulfur, and 3) Investigation of design parameters such as particle size, morphology, surface properties, and mass loading of components in the sulfur/solid state electrolyte composite cathode. Enabled by the collaborative research team?s expertise in Li/S cell chemistry, solid-state battery technology, and synchrotron-based in-situ/operando characterization, this project will result in a comprehensive methodology for investigating and designing sustainable, next-generation energy storage systems. The results of the project will lead to the innovative design of S-LLZO composite cathodes, which is favorable for fast and sustainable electrochemical processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plastic pollution is a growing environmental concern, made worse by the increasing use of plastic during the coronavirus pandemic. Large plastic particles break down in the environment to eventually form plastic nanoparticles. These particles may have a variety of surface characteristics due to the variable conditions experienced by the plastics in polluted waterways. Plastic nanoparticles also have a large surface-to-volume ratio and can be porous, allowing them to easily sorb small molecule contaminants that may also be present in polluted waterways. If plastic nanoparticles are ingested by wildlife or humans, these toxic small molecules may leach out of the plastic and cause harm. As part of the project, Dr. Casabianca?s team will participate in summer camps sponsored by Clemson?s Programs for Educational Enrichment and Retention (PEER) and Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) programs and will also develop demonstrations for high-school students that relate chemistry to the problem of nanoscale plastic pollution. <br/><br/>The project will make use of Saturation-Transfer Difference Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy to test different types of plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride) for their ability to bind different contaminants. Competition STD-NMR will be used to investigate how other substances present in polluted waterways influence sorption of potential contaminants. Beyond just binding constants, the atomic site-specific nature of NMR spectroscopy and detailed structural information that it can provide will be used to understand the driving forces that are responsible for binding. Finally, in this project, the Clemson team will endeavor to develop new NMR methods to answer some the next questions on the horizon of environmental remediation and sensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An ongoing debate on the realization of consonant sounds is whether the amount of effort speakers make to produce them is represented for different sounds at an abstract level in the mind or is simply explained by the position these consonants occupy in words and sentences. This project sheds light on this matter by analyzing and comparing the acoustic properties of multiple consonants in different positions in two languages. Additionally, this study trains and supports student participation, contributing to the development of the next generation of language researchers.<br/> <br/>All sound productions require some degree of movement in the vocal tract, and languages generally show two processes that regulate the amount of effort involved in those movements, namely fortition (more articulatory effort and clearer gestures) and lenition (less effort and more relaxed movements). This study tests a) what kinds of consonants are affected by these two processes, b) how these two processes are conditioned by the position of the consonant (e.g., beginning of a word vs. between vowels vs. beginning of a phrase), and c) if some common sound patterns involving these two processes are predictable from the duration of different sounds. The analysis of two different languages also serves as a starting point for a cross-linguistic comparison leading to a greater understanding of the extent to which linguistic sound patterns are dependent on abstract mental processes or concrete physical ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through this professional development, the STEM instructional community (i.e., instructors, teaching assistants, and peer tutors/mentors) will gain the knowledge and skills to use evidence-based and culturally engaging practices in their learning spaces. The objective is to better serve and, ultimately, improve academic outcomes (i.e., course drops, grades, persistence) for students that experience the most academic inequities. Intentionally improving success for a diverse and talented, yet underserved, student population requires a commitment to the instructional community that teaches and supports students during early and pivotal moments in their academic careers. This instructional community includes instructors (largely non-tenure track), teaching assistants, and tutors/mentors that lead or assist instruction in lower-division, gateway, high needs, pre-requisite, and/or larger courses. While this instructional community has a large impact early on in students? academic careers, they typically receive less support, guidance, and funding on college campuses. As such, many lack the time, energy, and resources to engage in professional development. A product of this discrepancy is that this population also receives less attention in the research literature. As a result, knowledge gaps surrounding the impact and development of this instructional community compound inequity in the students they serve. The expected outcomes for this project include quality instructional and culturally engaging professional development and improved academic outcomes.<br/><br/>The question project proposes to answer is, will adequate funding, intentional support, and quality training in evidence-based and culturally engaging practices for the less privileged STEM instructional community (e.g., instructors, teaching assistants, and tutors/mentors) improve college success outcomes in the targeted courses? The project proposes to answer this question by offering competitive stipends and scholarships for the STEM instructional community to engage with three tiers of evidence-based, culturally engaging professional development. The project uses an intersectionality framework to inform professional development design, data collection, and data analysis. A recursive, action-oriented, mixed-method research emphasis will be employed based on academic outcomes, classroom observations, cultural engagement surveys, and qualitative contextualized inquiry for the continual improvement and success of the program and students. This project tackles a specific need identifiable by academic success data, one which promises to both have an immediate and direct impact on equitable student success at our institution. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The frequencies of ULF waves overlap with the range of drift frequencies of energetic electrons as they circle the Earth, leading to resonant interactions.  Numerous expressions have been derived to quantitatively describe radial diffusion so that they can be incorporated into global models of radiation belt electrons.  However, most expressions of the radial diffusion rates are derived only for equatorially mirroring electrons and are based on estimates of the power of ULF waves that are obtained either from spacecraft close to the equatorial plane or from the ground.  Recent studies using the Van Allen Probes and Arase have shown that the wave power in magnetic fluctuations is significantly enhanced away from the magnetic equator, consistent with models simulating the natural modes of oscillation of magnetospheric field lines.  This has significant implications for the estimation of radial diffusion rates, as higher pitch angle electrons will experience considerably higher ULF wave fluctuations than equatorial electrons.  This project will derive the magnetic and electric field wave powers and incorporate them into the 3D test particle simulations to estimate the diffusion coefficient.  The novel, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion rates will be introduced to a global model of radiation belt electrons to evaluate the effect of the pitch-angle dependence of the diffusion coefficient on radiation belt dynamics.  The result could have significant implications for the radial diffusion rates as currently estimated.  It will pave the way for incorporating pitch-angle-dependent radial diffusion coefficients in global models to predict the near-Earth radiation environment better.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the role of off-equatorial Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves on the radial transport and diffusion of relativistic electrons (100s keV to few MeV) in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7), investigating the effect of pitch-angle-dependent radial transport of energetic particles on global dynamics of the radiation belts. The following science questions will be answered: How are ULF electric and magnetic field fluctuations distributed in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time under varying solar and geomagnetic conditions? What is the role of off-equatorial ULF wave fluctuations on the radial diffusion and transport of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt (L~4 to 7)? How are off-equatorial ULF waves expected to impact current radiation belt models, and what is their contribution to the global dynamics of the radiation belts?  The team will use multiple satellite datasets (THEMIS, Van Allen Probes, Cluster, and Arase), test particle tracing simulations, and a global radiation belt model to quantify the contribution of off-equatorial ULF waves on radial diffusion in the radiation belts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dusty plasmas are common in space, such as tails of comets and the rings of Saturn, and in the semiconductor industry, where dusty plasmas can form during manufacturing of computer chips.  Control of floating and moving dust is a challenge for both fundamental plasma physics studies and the industrial applications.  This collaborative project allows the development of a novel method to trap dust particles in plasmas by combining cutting-edge optical and laser diagnostic techniques at Mississippi State University with advanced dusty plasma systems at Auburn University.  The project also provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students from historically excluded communities to obtain hands-on plasma science experience geared toward industrial applications.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will address one of the key challenges in the field of dusty plasmas: ?Tuning of plasma - dust grain interactions for precision control of trajectories and growth of nanometer and micrometer size particles? as stated in the 2020 Decadal Assessment of Plasma Science. A novel optical trapping technology will be designed to actively pin down single dust particles in the plasma and to transport them in a controlled way anywhere in the device. In addition, multifold laser diagnostic techniques will be used to measure the impacted plasma parameters resulting from physical and chemical processes, thus aiding understanding of particle-plasma interactions, particle charging behavior, and particle growth in a reactive dusty plasma at the microscopic level. The single-particle dusty plasma diagnostic techniques developed in this project can be readily adopted to other dusty plasmas such as magnetized dusty plasma, and for plasma fabrication and control in the industry.

As people age, the cartilage in their joints can break down, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. This makes performing everyday activities, like walking, climbing stairs, and even getting out of a chair, very difficult. Although there are treatments available for osteoarthritis, like oral pain medication and injections, they only provide temporary relief and do not cure the disease. As a result, surgery that replaces the damaged joint with an artificial one could be the only viable option.  However, this surgery is a very difficult procedure that requires a lengthy recovery period and carries additional risks for seniors with underlying health conditions. Use of nanoparticles can potentially help in treating the early stages of tissue failures but there is a lack of knowledge about their interactions with biological tissues. That is why the goal of this project is to understand the processes happening upon nanoparticles contacting heathy and damaged tissues. The researchers propose to focus on diamond nanoparticles as a controlled system of study. The project will focus on  understanding the mechanisms of interactions of these tiny particles with biological tissues and immune cell. In addition to the research itself, this project also aims to provide educational opportunities for students in the fields of materials science, biomedical engineering, and surface science. By engaging more students, especially women and minorities, the project will create a more diverse and inclusive scientific community, enabling new discoveries and innovations in the STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>In the early stages of osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down and the joint becomes inflamed, leading to pain and reduced mobility. One of the major challenges preventing the development of effective osteoarthritis treatment is the lack of understanding how the different mechanical, biochemical, and cellular processes within the joint interact with each other. This project aims to address this challenge by studying how diamond nanoparticles interact with joint cells and tissues to reduce damage and inflammation. The researchers will examine the effects of diamond nanoparticles on biological tissues and how they impact cell health as a function of the surface functionalization. The functionalized nanodiamonds will be analyzed for their ability to stay dispersed in body fluids and to escape macrophage attack to establish the correlation between the functionalization and the biocompatibility potential. Acquiring this essential knowledge will aid in comprehending the interactions between nanomaterials and biological cells, which will have a significant  broader impact on the advancement of nanoparticle-based treatments and therapies. This will be particularly useful for treating joint-related conditions such as osteoarthritis, leading to decreased pain, improved mobility, and the prevention of further joint damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thawing of previously frozen soils will have consequences for society through alteration of carbon emissions. Most previous research has focused on how Arctic ecosystems respond to average warming trends. There is however very little research on variability of environmental conditions within that average warming trend. The Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research site (ARC-LTER) community has found that tundra ecosystems respond strongly to fluctuations in environment on a range of time scales. ARC-LTER will continue to produce long-term data and perform modeling simulations that examine the role of that environmental variability on critical ecosystem functions. The main activities in this renewal will expand our understanding by focusing on how climate variability affects the terrestrial production and breakdown of organic matter and how those processes combine to affect CO2 production in lakes and streams. The project will therefore contribute understanding of how trends in mean climate, climate variability, and disturbances all interact to control arctic ecosystem structure and function. The project will have many broader impacts such as training of young investigators, engagement of K-12 teachers in research via the Earth Camp program, schoolyard activities and research experiences for teachers. Outreach to stakeholders will include briefings to Alaska State, North Slope Borough, and US government agencies overseeing environmental and natural resource programs.  ARC-LTER will also work with the Study of Environmental Arctic Change program on co-production of knowledge with Indigenous experts for use in decision making.<br/><br/>The 2023-2029 ARC-LTER project will determine how concurrence of climate trends and altered variability of environmental conditions combine to affect arctic ecosystems. The project will test the hypothesis that variability in environmental conditions is a stronger driver of change in the Arctic than are the average long-term trends in climate. The project will examine how ?openness? and ?connectedness? of ecosystems relate to disturbances such as wildfire and climate change. This research will include the maintenance of ongoing and development of new activities associated with long-term monitoring, experiments and numerical modeling work in the vicinity of Toolik Lake, AK. The project will address three main questions which will integrate research along the terrestrial-aquatic continuum:  Question 1: How does climate variability affect the openness and connectivity of arctic ecosystems? This research will focus on vegetation and biogeochemical cycles in moist acidic tundra along an existing nutrient gradient, within warming plots, and in nearby Alder stands. Question 2: How does climate variability affect key consumers and their influence on ecosystems? The research activities will focus on how climate variability affects the composition of consumer communities, their influence on ecosystems, and the genomic potential and metabolism of microbial communities. Question 3: How does climate variability affect carbon dynamics along the terrestrial-aquatic continuum? The project will study how the dynamics of carbon biogeochemistry along the continuum are affected by environmental variability. Together, the answers to these questions will improve our understanding on how long and short-term changes in environment shape ecosystem function.<br/><br/>This Long Term Ecological Research site is supported by The Division of Environmental Biology and the Office of Polar Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While some eruptions are explosive, others erupt without major explosive behavior, leading to different natural hazards for each eruptive style. These distinct eruption styles are controlled by the fundamental physical properties of magma, particularly viscosity, and density. The viscosity of magma is highly dependent on the atomic-scale structure of the magma, influenced by magma composition, temperature, pressure, and the presence of dissolved gases such as water vapor. In this study, the researchers aim to obtain fundamental physical constraints on the structure and viscosity of magma at conditions relevant to the Earth?s interior. We will combine the experimentally derived physical properties of magma and fluids with numerical simulations to predict how magmas migrate from the Earth?s subducting plates. It is the migration of this material that ultimately leads to eruptions at the surface, but the complex role of viscosity in magma transport makes it difficult to trace material from its source in the interior to the surface. The project will provide training for the next generation of Earth Scientists at various stages of their career, including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral scholars.  <br/><br/>Although extensive research has been done to constrain the elastic and transport properties of fluids and melts at conditions relevant to the Earth?s interior, the combined effects of pressure, temperature, and dissolved water remain poorly constrained at the conditions of the upper mantle where these melts are produced. This research will couple lab- and synchrotron-based experimental data to pressures up to 20 GPa with first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations, with the objective to determine the local melt structure, and fluid and melt viscosity to high pressures and temperatures. This work will quantify the structure and properties of aqueous fluids with dissolved albite, in addition to albite and basaltic melts with and without water. The results will provide insight into how pressure, temperature, and composition affect the structure and viscosity of polymerized aluminosilicate melts at mid-mantle depths and illuminate the causes of observed pressure anomalies on viscosity. The resulting viscosities will be integrated into two-phase flow models in the slab-arc system and the upwelling region above the mantle transition zone to assess the pathways of melt migrations through state-of-the-art geodynamical models. These models will assess how the pattern of fluid migration changes with slab age and subduction rate, slab thermal structure, and the distribution and volume of fluid sources in the subducting slab. The resulting work will assess the impact of fluid volumes due to melting and whether melting alone is sufficient to focus melts into a narrow region beneath volcanic regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ""West Virginia Network for Functional Neuroscience and Transcriptomics"" (WV-NFNT) project seeks to build human and physical infrastructure capacity in neuroscience and data science. This project will examine the ability of the nervous system to change during development and in response to stimuli along two themes: 1) circuit plasticity during development and adulthood; and 2) synaptic structure and plasticity as a result of altered function. WV-NFNT will expand the capability and variety of those working in the fields of neuroscience and data science by implementing specific education and workforce development activities that will engage students, especially rural college students in these research areas. New collaborations among neuroscientists and bio-informaticists from four institutions across the state will position West Virginia to be a center for neuroscience research. The project will be administered by the Higher Education Policy Commission in collaboration with four institutions: Marshall University, Shepherd University, West Virginia University, and West Virginia State University.<br/><br/>The WV-NFNT project will contribute to one of the most impactful neuroscience research areas ? circuit and synaptic plasticity. Despite the importance of neural plasticity, the mechanisms by which the brain changes are not fully understood. WV-NFNT is specifically designed to use advanced techniques including stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and single-cell and/or spatial transcriptomics to understand neural plasticity of circuits, neurons, glia, and synapses in various animal models. New methodologies to elucidate structure-function relationships at high resolution are advancing the ability to examine how synapses, cells, and neural circuits are controlled at a level of spatial detail that is not possible until recently. The WV-NFNT project brings together researchers who work on these questions and provides the infrastructure to address key gaps in knowledge about neural function. The project will grow the neuroscience and bioinformatics community in West Virginia, and a significant portion of the research component of this project will be conducted by graduate and undergraduate trainees. Formalized training and mentorship of trainees in neuroscience and data science research, coupled with access to internships, will contribute to the goal of placing West Virginians in competitive post-graduate programs or employment in STEM industries.

Improvements in insulation technology have the potential to reduce energy use nationwide, along with all carbon emissions associated with the production and transmission of that energy. According to the Energy Information Administration, 51% of all residential energy in the United States is used for heating and cooling living spaces, which amounts to about 11% of the total energy consumption of the country. This project aims to use the principles of biomimicry to develop a more effective batt insulation. Unlike other insulation materials, unprotected exposure by the insultation installers will not aggravate respiratory issues, which is increasingly important for homeowners and working people who suffer from the long-term effects of COVID-19. This project seeks to push the potential and affordability of this new technology while creating new American jobs. <br/><br/>The project is inspired by the nests of yellowjacket wasps that live in pockets of permafrost high above the Arctic circle. The nests are protected from extreme temperatures by the hollow wall structure surrounding the nest?s interior. This structure can be adapted to create insulation panels that are highly efficient, lightweight, water-resistant, non-combustible, non-toxic, non-dusting, and irritant-free. The project focuses on the development of such a thermal insulation material in an efficient way to keep its price point competitive with the current products. This involves designing a manufacturing machine capable of producing the new insulation quickly and consistently. To further push the thermal performance of the material, the company will also develop a complementary machine that can scan insect specimens in museum collections to assess biological structures that are highly reflective in infrared wavelengths and use the data to address management of radiative heat transfer. The team will apply a six-sigma approach to quality control for improving the insulation manufacturing process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After this impact, the early Earth likely experienced continued bombardment of leftover planetesimals. These bombardments are called late accretion impacts, some of which could be as large as the Moon. Both giant impacts and late accretion impacts are very energetic. Each of them can melt a large fraction of Earth?s mantle, and the surface can be as hot as 5,000-15,000 K. Such a hot surface would help the atmosphere escape to space, which is important for the surface environments of the early Earth. The lightest element - hydrogen - is most easily removed by this process, so in the presence of surface water the impact-driven atmospheric loss could result in the oxidation of Earth. The notion of such catastrophic evaporation is generally accepted in the exoplanet field, but it has not gained traction in the Earth sciences. This research will incorporate novel ideas developed in the exoplanet atmospheric literature to the study of the Hadean Earth (the first 500 million years of Earth history). The redox state of the atmosphere is also important for the emergence of life on Earth. Thus, our modeling of Earth evolution in the aftermath of high-energy impacts could provide a timely reference frame for those currently exploring exoplanets for signs of life. This project will support a postdoctoral researcher and contribute more broadly through mentoring New Haven Science Fair high school students.<br/><br/>Most research on the removal of volatiles from Earth?s early atmosphere focuses on a narrow temperature range of 1500?2500 K when mass loss is inefficient and limited by diffusion above the turbopause. The extreme thermal conditions right after high-energy impacts would quickly dissipate in a few hundred years, but even in this short period, the atmospheric loss can be on the order of several Earth oceans. The proposed research aims to quantify this extreme period of the early Earth, by conducting a fluid dynamical simulation of Earth?s post-impact atmosphere that incorporates the interior heat and the incoming X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation from our Sun. Because Earth?s early atmosphere would chemically interact with the magma ocean below, the evolution of the atmosphere will influence the redox evolution of the mantle. The relevant parameter space will be explored to assess how the different evolutionary pathways of the Hadean Earth comply with available geological data, and with other theoretical possibilities suggested in the literature. This will provide an unprecedented insight into the properties of the Hadean Earth and, in doing so, reveal how the loss of volatiles may be the missing nexus that explains why Earth is unique among the planets in our solar system.

By gaining fitness advantage, cancer cells undergo rapid growth.  The overarching goals of this award are to use theory and computations to provide quantitative predictions for collective motions of mixtures of cancer and normal cells and link them to changes in genome organization and dynamics. To accomplish the goals, the Principal Investigator (PI) will create physical models to elucidate the principles governing collective cell dynamics in mixtures of two cell types. The PI will also investigate the differences in the three-dimensional organization and dynamics of chromosomes between normal and cancer cells. The two major problems that the PI wishes to solve, using physics-based ideas, emerge from the following observations. First, it is unclear how the generation of a single cancer cell interacts with normal cells, and eventually spreads without control. Second, what are the differences between movements of normal and cancer cells as they move through constrictions that arise through cell jamming? The proposed problems were generated by surveying recent experiments have generated questions that can be quantitatively addressed using theoretical and computational methods. <br/><br/>To address how cancer cells invade the space of normal cells, in this award, the investigators will develop methods to solve the organization and dynamics when cancer cells are mixed with normal cells. Indeed, in all aspects of tissue formation, ranging from development to breakdown of their structures during cancer and other diseases, the description of how multiple cell types organize themselves is a difficult but an important issue. In this award, the Investigators will develop novel models to simulate the structures and dynamics of mixtures of cells as a function of cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions, and cell division, and apoptosis. The second goal is to study the effect of cell movement through constrictions on chromosomes in normal and cancer cells. As cells move, their motions are constricted through cell jamming, driven by self-crowding of cells and confinement, which profoundly affect chromatin structures, possibly resulting in altered gene expression. Most recent experiments have given glimpses of the differences in the chromosome organization between normal and cancer cells. The ability of a primary tumor to migrate to distant parts involves a cascade of steps in the invasion of the cancer cells into heathy tissues. During migration, cancer cells have to, at least occasionally, squeeze through constrictions in the extra cellular matrix surrounding the cells.  The sizes of the constrictions could be smaller than the nucleus size, which potentially deforms the genome in the cells.  The natural questions that need to be answered by this award are: Does the deformation of the nucleus alter the organization of the chromosomes? What insights can one gain by using theoretical methods to quantitatively understand these experiments? Answering these questions requires development of models that go roughly from the molecular scale to tissue level. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this award will include the development of curated software, which will be made publicly available.

Predicting those impacts requires understanding the role of climate in determining when and where diseases can occur. Understanding how climate affects pathogen evolution is also essential for improving disease prediction and management. Fungal pathogens cause many diseases that threaten hosts of agricultural and conservation concern. However, effects of environmental change on fungal pathogens are poorly understood. This is largely because fungi have complex life cycles that are challenging to study with respect to climate. For example, many fungi reproduce in different ways under different climate conditions. The researchers will determine effects of warming on fungal pathogens using mathematical models, field studies, and experiments. The models will simulate spread of infections by several types of pathogens under different climate scenarios. Data collection and analysis will focus on common plants and their fungal pathogens. These will be studied over a wide range of climate conditions. Undergraduates will contribute to the project through an introductory biology course at Truman State University. In that course, students will analyze images of diseased plants that were collected by citizen scientists around the world. Students will also be recruited to participate in field and laboratory research through the Tyson Undergraduate Fellows program at Washington University in St. Louis.<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to determine how climate warming changes the ecology and evolution of fungal pathogens. Most fungi are capable of both asexual and sexual reproduction, and each phase of the life cycle can be temperature dependent. In temperate regions, many fungal pathogens produce asexual (clonal) spores from spring through early fall seasons and then undergo sexual production of an overwintering stage when temperatures cool in later fall. Warming should alter the production, survival, and dispersal of clonal spores as well as the frequency of sexual reproduction and genetic recombination. In Aim 1, the researchers will develop a general metapopulation model to evaluate how effects of temperature on pathogen life-history traits lead to changes in pathogen prevalence and genotypic diversity under different climate scenarios. They will resolve how model outcomes depend on pathogen thermal biology, mating system, and other parameters. In Aim 2, the researchers will experimentally quantify thermal performance curves for life history traits of a fungal plant pathogen collected along a climatic gradient. They will test for pathogen local adaptation to thermal regimes and wild host plant populations. In Aim 3, the researchers will assess relationships between climate and the occurrence and genotypic diversity of the focal pathogen. This aim will be accomplished through field surveys, genotyping, and a citizen science project coupled with a course-based undergraduate research experience. Those data will be compared to predictions from a version of the metapopulation model parameterized for the focal study system. The project will integrate student training in a course-based undergraduate research experience class with data management and communication training to undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among its most significant applications are partial differential equations (PDEs) which, in conjunction with their analysis and numerical algorithms, represent some of the most powerful tools humanity has ever developed for understanding the material world. However, increasingly complex mathematical models arising from physics, biology, and chemistry challenge the efficacy of first-principle-based approaches for solving practical problems, such as those in fluid turbulence, molecular dynamics, and large-scale inverse problems. A major obstacle for numerical algorithms is the so-called curse of dimensionality.  Fueled by advances in Graphics Processing Unit and Tensor Processing Unit general-purpose computing, deep neural networks (DNNs) and deep learning approaches excel in combating the curse of dimensionality and demonstrate immense potential for solving complex problems in science and engineering. This project aims to investigate how mathematical structures within a problem can inform the design and analysis of innovative DNNs, particularly in the context of inverse problems where unknown parameters are inferred from measurements, such as electrical impedance tomography. Additionally, the programming component in this project will focus on training the next generation of computational mathematicians.<br/><br/>The Operator Learning (OpL) framework in deep learning provides a unique perspective for tackling challenging and potentially ill-posed PDE-based problems. This project will explore the potential of OpL to mitigate the ill-posedness of many inverse problems, as its powerful approximation capability combined with offline training and online prediction properties lead to high-quality, rapid reconstructions. The project seeks to bridge OpL and classical methodologies by integrating mathematical structures from classical problem-solving approaches into DNN architectures. In particular, the project will shed light on the mathematical properties of the attention mechanism, the backbone of state-of-the-art DNN Transformers, such as those in GPT and AlphaFold 2.  Furthermore, the project will examine the flexibility of attention neural architectures, enabling the fusion of attention mechanisms with important methodologies in applied mathematics, such as Galerkin projection or Fredholm integral equations, in accordance with the a priori mathematical structure of a problem. This project will also delve into the mathematical foundations of attention through the lens of spectral theory in Hilbert spaces, seeking to understand how the emblematic query-key-value architecture contributes to the rich representational power and diverse approximation capabilities of Transformers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Free-living amoebae are single-celled microorganisms that feed on smaller microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Free-living amoebae are important predators in soil and aquatic ecosystems, influencing microbial communities and contributing to the evolution of bacterial strategies to evade predation. However, the mechanisms that govern interactions between free-living amoebae and bacteria are poorly understood. This research will investigate how free-living amoebae interact with pathogenic and benign bacteria, and how these interactions shape microbial communities. The research is important because it will provide insights essential for engineering of microbial communities and prevention of pathogen growth in soil and aquatic environments. The fellow will broaden participation of groups underrepresented in biology through the formation of a postdoctoral peer mentoring group, which will encourage the retention of postdoctoral researchers from underrepresented groups in science by providing a venue for peer support and professional development.<br/><br/>This research will investigate how the ubiquitous free-living amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii interacts with diverse bacteria, and the resulting impacts on microbial communities. Specific hypotheses include the following: 1) A. castellanii utilizes distinct predation mechanisms for different bacteria, 2) A. castellanii preferentially grazes on benign bacteria versus pathogenic bacteria, 3) chemotaxis is not involved in A. castellanii predation, and 4) predation mechanisms employed by A. castellanii for grazing on bacteria in biofilms are distinct from those used for grazing on planktonic cells. Hypotheses will be investigated using transcriptomics, advanced microscopy, and microfluidic chips with live-cell microscopy. The research will provide vital knowledge regarding predator-prey theory and the interactions between amoebae and bacteria in environmental systems. It also will inform the fields of environmental engineering and public health, which require a deeper understanding of microeukaryotes to effectively control microbial communities and prevent pathogen proliferation. The fellow will receive mentoring in analysis of transcriptomic data sets and live-cell microscopy through the sponsoring scientists. The fellow will also work to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biology through mentorship of undergraduate and graduate students in the laboratory and the formation of an interdisciplinary postdoctoral peer mentoring group, which will provide professional development and increase a sense of belonging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Converting lignin, a largely underutilized yet chemically rich byproduct of the biorefining industry, to valuable aromatic platform chemicals is an energy-intensive process that has made this approach cost prohibitive. Recently, dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells (similar to photovoltaic cells) have emerged as a low-cost and environmentally friendly technology for converting solar energy into chemical fuels or electricity. These photoelectrochemical cells offer a means of using renewable solar energy to drive energy-intensive chemical conversions at ambient temperature and pressure. Here, the collaborative fundamental research project will study how a dye-sensitized photoanode can chemoselectively oxidize lignin with a suitable catalyst as a first step toward a complete light-driven lignin depolymerization process. This approach will expand on the use of heterogeneous catalysis for the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to produce carbonyl or carboxyl compounds for the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. This work represents a new application for dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells, and the research findings from the project will be disseminated to the public through research publications, conference presentations, and by organizing and hosting educational outreach programs for future professionals in the STEM field. The PIs will also actively recruit and support underrepresented minority students through the outreach program.<br/><br/>Organic oxidation reactions are important in organic synthesis or lignocellulosic biomass processing. Chemoselective oxidation of the aliphatic and/or benzylic alcohol moieties in lignin is a good target for controlling the degradation of lignin to generate desired small molecular products. This project aims to elucidate a photoelectrosynthetic chemoselective oxidation of alcohol moieties in lignin by combining the use of aminoxyl mediators with a dye-sensitized photoanode (DSP) at room temperature. Essential to this approach is the use of a dye-sensitized electrode interface to activate a nitroxyl mediator via light-induced charge separation. This presents both a new approach for driving the photochemical oxidation of the secondary benzylic alcohol and the primary aliphatic alcohol functional groups found in lignin, as well as a new photocatalytic application for dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells, which have traditionally focused on solar water splitting. The approach will involve (1) the synthesis of photoactive polymeric catalysts and the elucidation of their underlying photochemical electron transfer properties for activating nitroxyl mediators, (2) the fabrication and evaluation of mesoporous semiconductor-based electrodes specifically designed for the chemoselective oxidation of lignin dimer model compounds with a series of nitroxyl mediators, and (3) the elucidation of mechanistic pathways for the light-driven oxidation of 2o benzylic and 1o aliphatic alcohols using a DSP and address practical challenges presented by the use of oligomer model compounds and technical lignin. This research is significant as a first test case of a DSP to carry out the selective oxidation of real lignin at room temperature as a first step toward light-driven biomass conversion to value-added chemicals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These particles seed the upper atmosphere with an array of metal ions and atoms which have important effects on the chemistry of the atmosphere and play a role in creating dust, which in turn seeds clouds.  This award will further develop the field of meteor physics through modeling meteor evolution from their point of entry into the atmosphere through their dissipation.  We will use radar observations to test our models and understandings. The research has a wide range of applications.  Spacecraft designers need to know the distribution of particle orbits and masses in order to reduce potential hazards. Solar system scientists use meteoroid population characteristics to better understand the outer solar system and its evolution. Atmospheric scientists apply meteoroid data to estimate the amount of material deposited in the upper atmosphere and its chemical evolution. A deeper understanding of meteor plasma physics will improve the broader scientific and engineering community?s knowledge of meteor and upper atmosphere geoscience.  This project involves members of underrepresented groups and supports graduate and undergraduate students.  The code developed will be open source. The team will continue their efforts to share their knowledge and enthusiasm about space and meteor science with the larger community through outreach to the media, K-12 schools, and at universities through public talks. This will broadly enhance STEM education and talent.  <br/><br/>Over the past decades, meteor researchers have used simulations, theory, and observations to study meteor plasma dynamics and their radar measurements. This award will extend this work to areas that remain poorly understood: the early stage of meteor ablation, the behavior of meteor-induced plasma waves, the interaction between a spatially variable atmosphere and meteors, and the scattering of radio waves by meteor plasmas. The team will generate new models more accurate and reliable than those that currently exist, and then apply these physics-based models to interpret data collected by radars.  This award will help answer the following questions: (1) How rapidly does ablation proceed for various meteoroids? (2) How do meteor plasmas evolve from their initial ablation and ionization through the early-stage kinetic expansion to their later-stage diffusion and turbulence? (3) Can more accurate theoretical and computational models improve researchers? quantitative understanding of radio wave scattering? (4) How do large-scale atmospheric inhomogeneities and neutral wind shears modify the evolution of long-lived plasma trails produced by meteoroids? Answering these questions will lead to progress in understanding atmospheric dynamics between 75 and 120 km altitude. It will provide better interpretations of measurements made by radar and optics.

Data-driven systems, on the other hand, must deal with noisy, uncertain, and outlying measurements, as well as data provided by untrustworthy or even malicious sources. In addition, graph-aware systems must cope with errors in the estimated graph structure. Aspiring to address these challenges, this project introduces a comprehensive framework for robust learning over graphs that can identify and mitigate outliers, adversarial attacks, and errors in the graph structure. The development of scalable, robust, and trustworthy learning can enable active and timely inference and decision-making in domains such as social analytics, crowdsourcing, health informatics, and Internet-of-Things security.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to fortify learning over graphs against noise, anomalies, errors in the data, and adversaries.

T1 leverages random sampling and consensus, as well as graph signal processing tools to pinpoint outlying nodes. Dealing with noisy or perturbed graph topologies, T2 endows graph convolutional networks with dithering-inspired modules that are robust to changes in graph links.

A widespread and very useful framework for studying both of these tasks is provided by probabilistic graphical models.  This framework originates in statistical physics, and physical intuition has guided both the development of algorithms and the understanding of computational complexity.  A common setting in both practical and scientific applications is the imposition of global constraints on a graphical model; examples including fixing the number of interacting particles in a system, fixing magnetization in a mathematical model of a magnet, or fixing the sizes of a partition of elements.  A rigorous understanding of the performance of algorithms in this setting is still largely absent. The goal of this project is to develop new techniques in algorithms and complexity to understand how global constraints influence the tractability of these sampling and optimization problems.  Guided by insights from statistical physics, this research project will develop new algorithms and study the limits of algorithmic approaches. The project also involves the training of graduate students in interdisciplinary research and a high-school outreach program.<br/><br/>The main research goal of the project is to build a robust theory of sampling and optimization in the presence of global constraints in several algorithmic contexts: computational thresholds for approximate counting and sampling; Markov chain mixing times; and the structure of optimization problems on random graphs.  Preliminary work shows that imposing a global constraint on a Markov random field can transform the behavior and complexity of the associated sampling and optimization problems.  Specific problems the project focuses on include the determination of computational thresholds for the antiferromagnetic Ising model at fixed magnetization on bounded degree graphs; proving optimal mixing time bounds for conservative dynamics like the Kawasaki dynamics; and understanding the limiting values of optimization problems on sparse random graphs.

Photochemical cells operate by absorbing light from the sun and use that light energy to drive chemical reactions. The efficiency of the device is the net result of a series of interdependent fundamental processes, including light absorption, charge separation, and charge migration, as well as the collection of charges that can be used to drive chemical reactions. The separated charges can also undergo unproductive recombination within the device, resulting in loss of efficiency. Each of these interconnected processes depends heavily on the types of materials used within the cell, making it necessary to study a functional system rather than the individual parts in isolation.  Dr. Young and her students will use femtosecond pump-probe methods to study photoactive devices under potential bias and steady-state illumination. Their discoveries could further our understanding of the complex kinetic networks that are central to the functioning of the chemical conversion devices needed for sustainable chemistry applications. The project will also provide research opportunities for students, thus contributing to the development of the Nation's scientific workforce. <br/><br/>This project centers on the use of transient absorption spectroscopy coupled with electrochemical and photolysis techniques to quantify charge transfer dynamics in semiconductor material stacks that undergo photo-induced charge transfer. The project will utilize atomically precise, extremely thin absorbing chalcogenide materials synthesized using atomic layer deposition. Such materials are particularly well suited because layer thicknesses and compositions can be finely tuned to enable systematic study in both planar and nanostructured devices. The influence of an applied electrochemical potential and steady-state illumination (i.e., the most realistic operating conditions for photovoltaics and photoelectrical chemical cells) on charge-carrier dynamics and charge transfer kinetics will be quantified to determine how steady-state conditions influence ultrafast lifetimes and charge transfer kinetics.

While epidemics can be mitigated through a variety of interventions such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, mandated social distancing, and vaccine allocations, many of these methods can be extraordinarily costly, both in terms of creating hardship and unemployment as well as in terms of reducing access to crucial services for vulnerable populations. Furthermore, popular backlash against harsh epidemic control interventions can make their long term sustainability impossible. This project will address the problem of designing such interventions optimally. The goal will be to design a mix of interventions such as those mentioned above to achieve a target rate for how fast an epidemic should decay while imposing the least hardship upon society at large. <br/> <br/>This project will develop interventions that are both spatially heterogeneous and coordinated among different locations. Optimal epidemic control strategies will be obtained by treating different locations differently, based both on the number of cases at each location as well as the geographic importance of each location for future epidemic spread.

The technical approach will take into account uncertainty in disease parameters, which can vary not only depending on location but are constantly evolving in time depending on interventions and human behavior. Finally, solutions will also be developed that respect certain fairness constraints, such as ensuring that locations with fewer cases do not face harsher lockdowns, which is a counter-intuitive feature of some optimal lockdowns. The newly developed methods will be guaranteed to work in a number of operations that is polynomial, and often linear, in the size of the spatial epidemic model, ensuring that the final results are applicable to large-scale epidemic models in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional electronic elements use electron charge to store and transmit information. For example, the amount of charge accumulated on a capacitor may determine whether it contributes a ?0? or a ?1? binary digit.  On the other hand, spintronic devices exploit another property of electrons, called spin (up, down, or canted), to encode information.  These devices can in fact use spin currents to control logic operations faster and more energy efficiently than charge currents can accomplish in conventional semiconductor transistor-based logic.  Spintronics devices typically consist of ferromagnets as the source of the spin current. Incorporating elements that are superconductors, which have no electrical resistance, can enhance the overall device performance and offer new functionalities, such as remarkably low-dissipation (energy loss) spin transport.  Such ferromagnetic-superconductor structures are also constituents of schemes for topological quantum computing, an architecture that is predicted to be robust to environmental noise that plagues other quantum device platforms.  This project investigates ferromagnetic-superconductor devices that could form building blocks of novel computing architectures by imaging nanoscale magnetic fields throughout the device and determining the effects of temperature and an applied current on the device operation.

The more familiar semiconductors like silicon, which is widely used in microelectronics and computer chips, are inorganic. However, semiconductors based on organic molecules offer advantages such as less expensive materials processing and more favorable mechanical properties. Organic materials continue to make inroads into commercial devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes or OLEDs used in displays (the ?OLED? TV), solar cells, which convert sunlight into electrical energy, and even ?wearable? electronic devices and sensors. The PI and his research team will investigate fundamental processes such as light absorption and light emission in organic crystals and aggregates, as well as how the energy from light absorption is transported between molecules - similar to what occurs in plants during the process of photosynthesis. The research team will conduct a theoretical investigation by solving equations based on quantum mechanics which describe how organic molecules respond to light. The equations will be solved using sophisticated computer algorithms. Of particular interest are certain electronic excited states known as excimers, which emit light of longer wavelengths and convert electronic energy into light energy less efficiently. The PI and his team will study how such excimers form and ultimately how to design molecular aggregates which avoid excimer formation. The proposed activities will also enhance research infrastructure through collaborations with experimentalists such as Professor Libai Huang at Purdue University, who will employ state-or-the-art experimental techniques to probe energy transport in organic films. Overall, this research effort should contribute to a blueprint for the next generation of electronic devices based on organic materials.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on how light is absorbed or emitted from semiconductor materials made of organic molecules. Solid phases of pi-conjugated molecules and polymers continue to receive widespread attention as semiconducting materials in field effect transistors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. However, despite the more than five decades of intensive experimental and theoretical research following Kasha's pioneering work on molecular H- and J-aggregates, important questions remain regarding the fate of photo-excitations and how their spectral signatures depend on crystal packing and morphology. The PI?s group has extended Kasha?s model, which is predicated entirely on long-range Coulombic coupling, to include short-range (super-exchange) coupling arising from intermolecular charge-transfer, as well as local coupling to the vinyl-stretching mode responsible for pronounced vibronic progressions in the UV-Vis spectra of a great many conjugated molecules. Although the model can predict with quantitative accuracy details of the absorption spectral line shape and correlate spectral features to the nature of the underlying excitons, it is limited in its ability to describe photoluminescence and energy transport, processes which often require the inclusion of excimers. Excimers, common in pi-conjugated molecules, arise when an electronic excited state relaxes along a ?slow? intermolecular (phonon) coordinate resulting in featureless, red-shifted emission. In this project, the next generation of molecular H- and J-aggregate models will be developed which account for excimer formation and emission. The approach is based on a Holstein-Peierls Hamiltonian which includes electronic coupling along the slow-coordinate, is particularly strong in closely packed systems like ?-stacks, where the intermolecular electron and hole transfer integrals are hypersensitive to small, sub-Angstrom, changes in the relative orientation of neighboring chromophores. The Holstein-Peierls approach enables all of the important physical processes to be treated on equal footing and fully quantum-mechanically. The model will be employed to account for the absorption and photoluminescence spectral line shapes in excimer-forming perylene diimide dimer complexes and larger ?-stacks. The ability of excimers to function as energy traps will be investigated through analysis of the density matrix equations of motion. Libai Huang at Purdue University will collaborate and provide experimental validation by conducting spectroscopic measurements and femtosecond-resolved transport measurements of several perylene diimide derivatives which display varying degrees of excimer emission. The PI?s approach may enhance the likelihood for discovering new and potentially useful physical phenomena, as well as design strategies for controlling excimer formation for device applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data collected at farms enabled artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks to develop models capable of predicting traits such as crop yields and health conditions, allowing for data-informed decision-making. However, in the current state of practice, these smart farms are siloed, developing AI models solely based on data obtained from a farm, ignoring the data generated in other farms. This lack of collaboration among farms results in limited generalization capability of models and directly impacts farm management decisions. While pooling data from a network of farms into a centralized server to generate more robust models is possible, most farmers are reluctant to share their data due to data privacy concerns. Therefore, this project aims to develop a novel holistic framework that allows for collaboration between farms, preserves privacy, and encourages simultaneous collaboration and personalization in the data-driven modeling of agricultural farms. The constructed models are used in farm decision-making and management. This framework will alleviate farmers? data privacy concerns, resulting in further adoption of smart farming technologies. Therefore, the project may result in the more prevalent use of digital tools by farms, improving management decisions and increasing farm productivity. Eventually, the acceptance and use of digital solutions will enhance food quality and decrease the environmental footprint. Several educational and outreach efforts for the integration of research into undergraduate and graduate courses and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups are envisioned.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop a federated analytics framework for high-dimensional and big data common in smart agricultural farms. The project will design a novel federated robust tensor-based modeling paradigm that enables exploiting the spatiotemporal structure of smart farm datasets. When the proposed approach is used, each farm creates a local model that is then transmitted to an aggregator, which creates an aggregated model. The aggregated model is then broadcast to each farm to generate a personalized model that supports local decision-making. The low-dimensional embedding of the tensor model allows for reduced model communication between the farms and the aggregator. Differential privacy approaches will be investigated to enhance the privacy-preservation properties of the proposed framework. The developed AI-enhanced connected multi-farm system will be tested in citrus as a case study. The proposed framework can contribute to other areas, such as modeling and monitoring multi-farm renewable energy systems and multi-facility advanced manufacturing systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key theme across modern applications of distributed computing is the impact of dynamics, or frequent changes in the system's members or the connections among them. From disease contact tracing based on smartphones coming in and out of range to understanding the collective intelligence of social insects behaving as a superorganism, distributed algorithms for these ""dynamic networks"" enable innovations both within and beyond computer science. This project addresses two major limitations of current algorithms for dynamic networks: assuming that dynamics can never happen at the same time as individuals' actions, and assuming the dynamic network can only perform one task at a time. Designing distributed systems that can adapt their behavior based on their changing environment, even in spite of concurrent dynamics, will tie this rich theory more directly to computational, biological, and social applications. Furthermore, the project will have impact in (a) broadening diverse participation in computer science at both the student and faculty levels, (b) undergraduate research, continuing the researchers' strong mentorship record, and (c) education and outreach through advanced courses and research talks.<br/><br/>This project investigates the algorithmic theory of dynamic networks, i.e., distributed systems with frequent (or adversarial) changes in the system's members or their connections. Motivated by domains where individuals have limited or no explicit computational power, this project specifically focuses on a setting where nodes are anonymous (lacking unique identifiers), have sublogarithmic memory (insufficient for computing identifiers), and communicate via message passing. This project's core problems have two main foci: asynchronous concurrency and adaptive self-organization. The first thrust aims to achieve concurrency control for dynamic networks, bridging the generality of asynchronous concurrency with the ease of algorithm design and analysis in simpler versions of concurrency. The second thrust focuses on adaptive self-organization, initiating the study of time-varying system tasks controlled by environmental signals. This family of problems abstracts self-stabilizing task allocation, extending established research on core distributed computing problems for dynamic networks to the anonymous and adaptive setting suitable even for modeling systems without explicit computational capabilities (e.g., granular active matter). Together, these aims will advance fundamental knowledge of dynamic networks theory and contribute downstream to interdisciplinary efforts in programming and characterizing collective behavior in biological and social systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These gardens offer an opportunity to bridge traditional gardening and 21st-century technological skills while fostering community engagement by supporting youth in using emerging technologies to address critical issues such as food security. Drawing upon an emancipatory community design and research approach, the program involves youth participatory action research in which young people use research methods to make sense of and address social problems of community food insecurity by building and programming restorative gardens in their local communities. These gardens will serve as a bridge where youth, community, and younger peers can come together to learn and share how emerging technologies can be used to support and advance improvements in urban farming. The career development component features near-peer mentoring to engage youth in exploring a wide array of related STEM career opportunities. This project offers a much-needed approach to support youth in examining careers across fields of agriculture and computation, rather than a specific field, which is valuable for youth who are beginning their career explorations. The outcomes of this project will reveal valuable insights regarding how to integrate restorative gardening, near-peer mentoring, and youth participatory action research to increase youth STEM self-efficacy and re-engage youth who are opting out of STEM career paths.  This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts, and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. This project is also funded through the CS for All: Research and RPPs program. <br/><br/>Researchers will use an emancipatory community design and research (ECDR) framework in which youth and community member voices are central to the project's implementation. They will identify locations for restorative gardens, share and conduct research with the local community on what should be grown in the gardens, establish strategies for sharing knowledge about gardening to and from the community, and lead community workshops on the underlying technologies of restorative gardens. The project is guided by the following research questions: (1) How does participating in the restorative garden project (and peer mentoring) impact youth's desire and self-efficacy to pursue and stay in STEM career fields? (2) How does participating in the restorative garden project impact youth's understanding of STEM (coding and AI) concepts and systems thinking skills? (3) How does participating in this project impact youth's place identity and STEM identity? (3)(a) How does participating in youth participatory action research around restorative gardening contribute to youth's ideas of environmental responsibility, food sovereignty, and global citizenship? The research and evaluation will employ a mixed-methods approach to investigate the project's impact on youth's STEM learning, identity, and career aspirations, as well as support their conceptualization of place identity, environmental responsibility, food sovereignty, and global citizenship. One hundred and eighty youth will be tracked over time to evaluate what aspects of the program are critical to their success and STEM identity. This information will be used to better understand how to blend and mesh the robust mentoring network of young people participating in the project, with the goal of developing youth's STEM career awarenesss and adaptability. Project deliverables include restorative gardens equipped with automated urban gardening robots; reports and publications documenting the research findings and best practices developed through the project; near-peer mentoring resources and tools that could be adapted and used by other organizations; educational materials to teach youth about emerging technologies; and youth-generated content such as photovoice stories that showcase the impact of the project on the participating youth and their communities.

The knowledge about the function of proteins is important for biological research and technology development. However, the function of most proteins is still unknown. To fill the gap, this project aims to develop deep learning methods, one of the most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, to integrate multiple sources of protein data such as protein sequences, structures, and interaction to accurately predict protein function. The methods will advance the state of the art of protein function prediction and can be broadly applied in many domains such as life science research, biotechnology development, agriculture, and healthcare. The project will provide unique interdisciplinary research opportunities to train students at multiple levels including under-represented minority students with diverse backgrounds to apply AI to address fundamental scientific and technological problems. <br/><br/>The project will develop deep transformer models based on self-attention to integrate protein sequence, structure, and interaction data to significantly advance the prediction of both protein-level function and amino acid-level function. Specifically, it aims to achieve three objectives: (1) develop 1D and 3D transformers to predict protein function from multiple sequence alignments and structures; (2) develop 2D graph transformers to predict protein function from protein-protein interactions and integrate them with sequences and structures; and (3) implement transformers as user-friendly, accurate, robust open-source protein function prediction tools for the community. Cutting-edge deep transformer models based on the self-attention mechanism will be developed to integrate protein sequence, structure, and interaction data to predict protein function for the first time. 1D sequence-based transformer, 2D graph transformer, and 3D-equivariant graph transformer can extract amino acid conservation and long-range co-evolutionary signals in multiple sequence alignments, long-range interactions in protein-protein networks, and rotation- and translation-invariant/equivariant properties of protein structures better than the existing deep learning methods based on traditional convolutional and recurrent mechanisms. Predicting both overall protein-level function terms and residue-level function sites via multi-task learning and novel deep learning architectures can leverage the compliment of the two prediction tasks to provide more accurate, more complete, and more interpretable function prediction. The project will deliver user-friendly open-source tools for the community to accurately predict function from sequence, structure, and interaction data, which will help reduce the vast knowledge gap between protein sequence and function. The open-source deep learning tools can be used to predict and study protein function in many domains. The methods and tools will be leveraged to train students at multiple levels and increase the diversity in scientific research and education.

The team will create, characterize, simulate, and test how atoms of distinct metals move and facilitate reactions upon the surfaces of nanoparticles comprised primarily of gold with small amounts (1-5%) of a second element such as palladium or platinum. These materials are commonly described as single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts. These materials offer high rates and selectivities for numerous reactions important for domestic production of energy carriers and platform chemicals (e.g., valorization of biomass, shale gas, operation of fuel cells and electrolyzers). SAA currently suffer from a distressingly low number of active sites per gram of precious metal used. The collaborative team aims to develop methods to create SAA nanoparticles with smaller diameters (< 2 nm) to remedy this problem, and then test if the emergent and beneficial catalytic properties of these SAA are preserved as the size of the nanoparticles decreases. Here, the team will combine cutting-edge methods in quantum chemical simulations and multiscale modeling, characterization of operating catalysts using synchrotron methods, and catalyst testing and spectroscopy to learn how the nanoparticles restructure in different combinations of reactive gases relevant for catalysis (e.g., oxygen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide). Subsequently, the team will assess how rates and selectivities for a testbed reaction (reduction of oxygen with hydrogen) depend on the spatial organization of the atoms on the nanoparticle surface. Methods that will be developed will be useful for other dynamic catalyst systems and will be integrated into graduate-level courses. The proposed work involves lab-based education of graduate and undergraduate students and focused efforts to increase participation of women in catalysis science, especially with NSF REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) opportunities and cross-training of researchers across the three partnering institutions.<br/><br/>Under this award, the collaborative Flaherty/Hibbitts/Karim team aims to learn how the structure, dynamics, and catalytic properties of bimetallic and SAA materials depend upon mean particle diameters, composition, and support identity, all factors that impact the coordinative saturation of surface atoms and the identity of their nearest and next-nearest neighbor atoms. The team will couple precise synthesis, advanced characterization techniques (including n situ, operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, microcalorimetry, infrared spectroscopy), and computational methods (simulations of full nanoparticles with density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo) to address the complexity and dynamics of SAA catalysts. A testbed reaction system with rates and selectivities proven to be structure-sensitive with respect to these materials (H2 + O2 ? H2O2) will be used to probe the surface structures of active catalysts, a challenge as the high pressures and complex solvents used often render characterization difficult. First, Au-rich bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (i.e., M1Aux materials, where M = Pd, Pt, Rh) with mean diameters of 1-2, ~6 and ~10 nm will be created, their post-synthesis structures will be characterized, and then the influence of adsorption and reactions on their structures will be examined over extended periods.  Second, the thermodynamic relationships among adsorption energies, active site motifs, and nanoparticle structure will be determined. Third, the fundamental connections surrounding  elemental identity, mole fraction, and coordination of the reactive metal and reaction rates, selectivities and barriers for H2O2 and H2O formation will be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the properties of the oceanic flow field at intermediate scales, referred to as the submesoscales, have remained relatively elusive because of observational limitations: most high-resolution in-situ observational measurements have limited spatial range while satellite-based velocity estimates have limited spatial resolution. In addition, satellite-based surface velocities are estimated using the simplified physics assumptions (geostrophy), which breaks down at the submesoscales. Overall, a global view of kinetic energy as a function of length scale in the submesoscale range is not currently available. The primary goals of this project are i) to estimate kinetic energy distribution and transfers at submesoscales, ii) to understand the role of balanced and wave-like flow components in setting these submesoscale energetics, and iii) to quantify how and assess why these submesoscale flow properties vary globally. This research will quantify global submesoscale kinetic energy content, its dynamical characteristics, and transfers as a function of spatial-scale, using existing surface drifter observations from NOAA. Global observations of kinetic energy at these scales have never been examined before: this work is a unique opportunity to characterize the spatial patterns and seasonal variability of ocean submesoscale flows, and to assess the effects of mixed layer depth and surface forcing on energy content at these scales. These estimates will provide the first global observational baseline to compare against future observations and high-resolution simulations, and one such comparison will be performed in this work. In addition, these observations will elucidate the energy budget of the global ocean by quantifying energy transfers across scales. In coarse resolution climate models, subgrid-scale parameterizations represent the effects of submesoscale motions: the baseline provided by this work will help improve these parameterizations in the future. The analysis will provide a useful ground truth to validate and calibrate future satellite observations, and to quantify biases in high resolution ocean models. Improved understanding of ocean energetics also has direct relevance for the development of better subgrid scale parameterizations for ocean and climate models. Additionally, this project will generate documented and open-source Python code for processing observational and synthetic Lagrangian data for future studies of ocean energetics. In terms of workforce training, this project will support one graduate student, who will learn how to analyze high-resolution model data using parallel processing tools in Python. Two undergraduate students will conduct suitable research projects and will be mentored through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at two different institutions. Two early-career scientists will be supported by this project.<br/><br/>To achieve its goals, this study will analyze the position and velocity data from the drifting surface buoys of the Global Drifter Program, with the help of two-point spatial statistics. Specifically, it will use the second order structure function to quantify how kinetic energy is distributed as a function of scale, and the third order structure function to quantify how kinetic energy is transferred across scales. Additionally, it will make use of Lagrangian filtering to quantify the statistical properties of and interactions between balanced and wave-like motions. These observational data analyses will be supported by the analysis of a high-resolution global ocean simulation, which will allow for the quantification of the biases caused by Lagrangian sampling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Good shape matching methods lead to many useful outcomes including a better understanding of human health, consumer preferences, and patterns in nature. The Frechet distance is often used for shape matching curves describing the movement of people or the shapes of the proteins used as the building blocks of the human body. Its popularity is largely due to its many nice mathematical properties, but there are several issues with its use on real-world data which is often large and messy in nature. Also, the possibilities for expanding its use to settings other than curves are not as well understood. The project seeks to study Frechet distance computing in the presence of messy data. It seeks new methods for computing Frechet distances that can be done quickly even for complicated curves. It also seeks ways to extend the main mathematical ideas behind the Frechet distance to data types other than curves. The project is collaborative and will lead to exchange of knowledge and student training opportunities between the investigators' institutions. It will lead to new shape matching software being made freely available to those who will find it useful.<br/><br/>The research activities have three components reflecting the expertise of the project's team of lead researchers. The first component specifically seeks new algorithms for studying messy curve data, focusing on problems designed to address noise and misalignments of the curves' representations. The second component seeks faster and effective approximation algorithms for the Frechet distance and some closely related problems. The third component seeks to apply insights made from work on the first two components to design new algorithms for extensions of the Frechet distance, including a novel interpretation of the so-called discrete Frechet distance in surfaces. Some of the theoretical algorithms designed for this work will be implemented and software made freely available for the general public. The work performed and knowledge gained during the research activities will be used to train new graduate students and offered as course material at the researchers' institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many species of diatoms produce chemical signals called oxylipins under stressful circumstances such as nutrient limitation, wounding due to grazing, and viral infection. These chemical signals are detrimental to many organisms that make up microbial food webs in the ocean, like other eukaryotic phytoplankton, microzooplankton and copepods that graze on phytoplankton, and free-living bacteria. However, particle-associated bacterial communities are stimulated by low doses of oxylipins, and diatoms can use these chemical signals to communicate amongst themselves about impending stress. Because these microbial food webs play a critical role in the Earth?s carbon cycle and these ecosystems ultimately support fisheries, it is important to understand the role chemical signaling plays as diatom blooms spin up and crash in productive upwelling regions. Here the investigators propose a field expedition with a series of deck-board incubations to study the effects of oxylipins on community dynamics in the California Current Ecosystem. The team also proposes a series of laboratory-based predator-prey studies to quantify the effects of oxylipins on microzooplankton grazers by documenting behavior with microvideography. The major questions that will be addressed include: 1) how does the concentration and diversity of oxylipins change over the course of a bloom? 2) what is the net impact of oxylipin signaling on community dynamics? 3) how do oxylipins impact carbon export and nutrient recycling (N, P, Si)? Outreach activities undertaken during the lifetime of this grant have the primary goals of introducing young people to microbial oceanography, training the oceanographic workforce, and creating content that can be accessed by inquiring minds after the lifetime of this grant. To accomplish this, undergraduate and graduate scientists are being trained during this project through direct participation on the planned cruise, in the lab, and in classrooms through virtual live-streaming cruise activities and in-person teaching. This project also uses cruise data to design data-analysis tutorials and workshops in order to engage the broader science community. Middle and high school students from local urban areas are also being trained on educational day trips in the coastal waters around Cape Cod. A curriculum is being developed for grade 8-12 classrooms related to the work of this project.<br/> <br/>This is the first study to profile the full diversity of oxylipins produced across dissolved, cellular, and detrital (i.e., marine snow) fractions. It is the first study to simultaneously assess in situ drivers of oxylipin production (nutrient stress, grazing, and viral infection) within an ecosystem. The project is also be the first to fully characterize oxylipin concentrations and diversity over the course of a bloom within an Eastern Boundary Current. The ultimate goal of this project is to understand how oxylipin-mediated signaling impacts the fate of carbon, so the team will be monitoring export efficiency, net primary productivity, bacterial productivity, and nutrient recycling throughout the field campaign. This project adds to the relatively small number of metatranscriptomic datasets from sinking particle communities and marine lipidomic datasets available in public repositories. The data generated by the Lagrangian Study can be used to ask more general questions about connectivity between the surface and deep ocean, community succession, and the geochemical evolution of blooms. Finally, the proposed research transforms our collective understanding of how chemical signaling impacts grazing behavior and the mechanism of oxylipin grazing deterrence by simultaneously assessing grazing rates, selection, and behavior of microzooplankton in the presence of exogenous oxylipins and when offered high and low oxylipin-producing prey. State-of-the-art microvideography visualizes and quantifies microzooplankton grazing behaviors, and the system will be adapted for measurements of natural communities at sea.  <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Programs in the Division of Ocean Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout history astronomy has also bridged communities, countries, and cultures. Various research projects, and anecdotal evidence among educators have shown that topics related to space and its big questions still have the potential to engage people across cultural and political borders. The Earth-sky connection has been a fundamental element in the development of both science and culture, and observations of the sky have helped to define culture, religion, agriculture, spiritual and even temporal points of view, as well as establish calendars, units of measure, travel time, orientation, among many other elements of modern life. <br/><br/>Today, astronomy remains an important part of our societal fabric. Numerous organizations and networks around the world work to explore and develop research and resources for the benefit of society. Astronomy is a connecting science that brings people together. Through the practice of science for diplomacy, astronomy and space sciences help to maintain open lines of communication between nations through collaboration; improving overall national security for all. In addition, astronomy is often referred to as a gateway science that inspires young and diverse learners here in the U.S. and abroad to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and can result a STEM-literate workforce that improves national prosperity and well-being. <br/><br/>The Global Network for Accelerating Synergies Through Research on Astronomy in Culture, Communication, Education and Learning (ASTRO ACCEL) will build an international network of networks (NoN) to accelerate research, resource development, and resource sharing focused on culture, communications, education/learning, and public engagement in astronomy. The result will be a global NoN that advances our knowledge and understanding in these areas for mutual benefit across the NoN. Further, in alignment with the NSF?s programs, Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, INCLUDES and Growing Convergence Research, ASTRO ACCEL will build upon existing networks to efficiently find creative solutions to complicated problems, and will bridge global communities of researchers and practitioners to accelerate research, improve practice, and further socioeconomic development, thus identifying new areas for convergence research and increasing the number of children worldwide with the resources and science capital required to pursue a career in STEM.<br/><br/>ASTRO ACCEL will use a structural folding and multimodal approach to bring together stakeholders from around the world to build the human capital and identify the cyber infrastructure necessary to support an international NoN of individuals and institutions, accelerate research in the key areas of astronomy education, engagement, culture, and communication, and accelerate the process of research-to-practice in these key areas. In accomplishing its goals, ASTRO ACCEL initially brings together ten well-established U.S. and international networks to focus research and resource sharing in three broad areas including a) formal astronomy education, b) informal astronomy education and astronomy communication, and c) use of astronomy for economic and social development. Throughout the three-year project additional organizations and networks will join the effort. By project end, it is anticipated that approximately 20 networks from across the globe and 300+ individuals will be actively engaged through ASTRO ACCEL.<br/><br/>Research on NoN development and sustainable practices will also take place. ASTRO-ACCEL will include a variety of in-person and virtual meetings, as well as other activities. Through a series of surveys and focus group interviews, ASTRO-ACCEL will explore participant experiences and best practices necessary in the creation of sustainable and robust NoNs. Data from the surveys and interviews will help project leadership evolve the implementation of practices and structures that facilitate long-term engagement of networks as well as individuals. Findings and best practices will be shared with the broader STEM enterprise through publications and professional conference presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, they are complex organisms that have a diverse bacterial community living on and in their cells (comprising a holobiont, the organism and its symbionts). However, there are significant limitations to the study of these holobionts. In this project, the closely-related upside-down jellyfish (Cassiopea xamachana) is developed as a model for understanding environmental effects on nearshore corals. These jellyfish contain a similar but less complex bacterial community, are abundant, uncomplicated to collect, and easy to study under laboratory conditions. Using insecticide exposure (associated with mosquito control) as a common near shore stressor, the project will quantify the effects of exposure on survival and changes in growth of all members of the holobiont, as well as changes in the function and interactions of the jellyfish bacterial microbiome. In addition to the potential to learn more about processes that will affect the coral community in the Florida Keys, this project will allow more undergraduate students to access scientific research and the field of biology, giving them an opportunity to consider research-based careers. By expanding undergraduate research at an institution with a high proportion of first-generation students and students of color, the voices involved in biology research can be broadened, while also bringing new ways of thinking and approaching problems to the scientific community.<br/><br/>The overarching theme of this project is to advance the C. xamachana photosymbiotic holobiont as an experimental system for studies on cnidarian associated individual microbes, the photosymbiont, and the polyp holobiont as well as the impact of insecticide exposure on these systems. The diverse cnidarian holobiont with its complex life cycle offers many potential targets also allows for the diverse ways insecticides that reach coastal waters. However, little work has been done to investigate the effects of insecticide exposure on coral survival, nor on the photosymbiotic Symbiodiniaceae or bacterial/archaeal microbiome which are integral to cnidarian health. C. xamachana is the ideal system to begin to discriminate the roles each microbial member plays in the response of a photosymbiotic cnidarian life cycle to insecticide exposure. C. xamachana exhibits an asexual polyp life stage that is only terminated after the establishment of photosymbiosis, an event accompanied by a distinct developmental transition from sessile polyp to juvenile medusa. Changes in bacterial gene expression in response to insecticide exposure during that developmental transition will be interrogated using next-generation sequencing. High-resolution microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization will localize bacteria of interest in the jellyfish. By combining these approaches with an examination of polyp nerve net function and growth of individual Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial cultures we can understand how exposure to the three insecticides used for mosquito control in the Florida Keys affects the diverse cnidarian holobiont. These results can inform conservation decisions on the Florida reef tract, threatened by a severe disease outbreak that may more strongly impact stressed corals, such as those exposed to insecticides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Hudson River estuary from a moored array and from ship-based surveys, will be used to resolve variability in time and in the along- and across-estuary directions. These measurements will include both the surface and sub-surface distribution of dissolved gases, and their distribution will be related to variations in vertical density stratification and estuarine circulation. Direct covariance atmospheric CO2 flux and water column turbulence measurements will be made from a fixed platform that spans the air-sea interface at a location where near surface turbulence is likely impacted by wind, waves, and tides, and is significantly modified by variations in vertical density stratification. These data will provide a quantitative model for the gas transfer velocity, which will be used to estimate atmospheric fluxes from the spatially resolved measurements of surface pCO2. It is hypothesized that the high outgassing of CO2 commonly inferred in the upper regions of many estuaries is strongly controlled by the underlying estuarine circulation. The measurements will address two long-standing research needs that contribute to the large uncertainties in estuarine CO2 emissions: 1) spatial and temporal heterogeneity in surface pCO2 values, and 2) poorly constrained gas transfer velocities. The research addresses these two fundamental uncertainties, both of which are strongly modulated by physical processes, and a new conceptual model for gas exchange that is hypothesized to be applicable to a wide range of estuaries will be tested. Moored instrumentation will quantify the importance of temporal variability at a range of time scales, not resolved in most previous studies. Direct covariance atmospheric CO2 flux measurements combined with observations of water column turbulence, waves and vertical density stratification will rigorously quantify the relationship between turbulence in the aqueous surface boundary layer and surface gas exchange. This addresses a fundamental interdisciplinary problem of significant societal importance and will significantly improve estimates of CO2 emissions from estuaries. This project will provide interdisciplinary training for a graduate student, who will be involved in all aspects of the project. Results from this research will be communicated to the public and scientific audiences, and to interested stakeholders through public seminars hosted by organizations that focus on Hudson River scientific and environmental issues and through presentations at national meetings. Several community college students will gain hands on experience building and testing new scientific sensors, which will be deployed in the Hudson River. Data from these sensors will be displayed at the Center for the Urban River at Beczak and used to develop educational materials for visitors to this center on the Hudson River.<br/><br/>This project will test the conceptual model that there is an estuarine gas exchange maximum (EGM), whose location is controlled primarily by the underlying estuarine dynamics. Analogous to the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM), the location of the EGM is hypothesized to be controlled by the convergence in the landward estuarine circulation near the limit of salt and occurs because vertical density stratification prevents the respiratory demand of sub-pycnocline waters in from exchanging with the atmosphere. This dependence on stratification will likely result in large asymmetries in atmospheric flux between spring and neap tides, which may fundamentally control the along-estuary location of the EGM. Significant across-estuary variability also is expected, potentially driven by lateral upwelling or strong lateral gradients in stratification. In the light-limited Hudson River estuary, fortnightly variations in stratification and mixing likely influence phytoplankton dynamics, which also may contribute to the spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric exchange.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Iron in contact with an oxidant such as oxygen can result in iron oxidation. When iron oxidation occurs in soils, it can lead to the sequestration of nutrients and metals; thus, understanding the mechanisms and controls on iron oxidation is critical. Microorganisms can catalyze iron oxidation, yet the extent of microorganism contribution to oxidation remains relatively unknown. This project evaluates microbial iron oxidation mechanisms (genes/proteins) to help identify when, and how much, microbial iron oxidation is occurring in the environment. This project specifically uses the iron-oxidizing bacterium Leptothrix cholodnii SP-6 to explore new iron-oxidizing mechanisms. The advanced knowledge can be applied to determine controls on iron-oxidizing bacterial activity and how to harness it for bioremediation, water treatment, resource recovery, and other applications. This project trains two graduate students and numerous undergraduates. In addition to public lectures, hands-on activities, and lab tours, a major outreach activity includes ""Microbes in the Wild"" workshops for middle school girls and first-generation college-bound students, who learn about the power of microbes to address environmental challenges. Culturing, genetics, and 'omics research tasks are being incorporated into college classes as multi-week experiential learning units.<br/><br/>A new genetic system in the heterotrophic iron-oxidizing bacterium Leptothrix cholodnii SP-6 provides an unprecedented opportunity to reveal new iron oxidation mechanisms. L. cholodnii SP-6 is easily culturable and its genome has numerous predicted metal oxidation genes including genes for multiheme cytochromes and multicopper oxidases with homologs in other iron oxidizers. Yet, the genome is missing well-known iron oxidase genes, making L. cholodnii SP-6 a good model organism to investigate novel iron oxidation mechanisms. This project is using a combination of culturing, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, genetics, and microscopy to determine the iron oxidation mechanisms in Leptothrix, notably SP-6. The research aims include (1) discover candidate iron oxidation genes in L. cholodnii SP-6 via transposon sequencing (TnSeq), transcriptomics, and proteomics. A high throughput pipeline for culturing and assaying iron oxidation is being developed so that as many genes as possible can be screened. (2) Explore the environmental diversity and frequency of Leptothrix iron oxidation genes via isolation and genomic characterization of new Leptothrix spp. followed by comparative genomics study. (3) Validate iron oxidation genes in L. cholodnii SP-6 via genetic methods of knockout and complementation. (4) Determine the role of iron oxidation proteins in biomineralization by labeling and localizing key iron oxidation proteins and imaging cells and biominerals by confocal and electron microscopy. Together, these approaches will establish a larger set of iron oxidation genes/proteins while understanding how these catalyze formation of environmentally important iron oxyhydroxide biominerals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team records natural speech in each language and elicits specific words and sentences in order to document aspects of the grammar. The recorded materials are archived in the California Language Archive, preserving language data into the future so that they are available to linguists, other academics, and speaker communities. This work fills an empirical gap, documenting the grammar of understudied languages, which is an important first step for developing language resources for the target languages, as well as for linguistic theory and typology. It also has important implications for our understanding of how languages work. The project strengthens existing international relationships between academics and builds relationships with rural communities, fostering cultural exchange and understanding. It also provides training to both local and international students, contributing to the development and diversification of the next generation of language researchers.<br/><br/>The four languages studied in this project all display morpheme-specific phonological processes that cross word boundaries. In one language, the imperfective aspect is marked by a shift in tone that affects the verb as well as the subject of the sentence. Morpheme-specific cross-word phonology is not well documented across languages, so this study begins to fill a gap in typological knowledge. Additionally, most formal theories of the interaction between morphology and phonology predict that morpheme-specific phonology should be limited to word or sub-word domains. The data from harmony and tone in these four languages shows this is an incorrect prediction. A deeper understanding of the boundaries of cross-word morpheme-specific phonology, and whether they align with morphosyntactic or prosodic boundaries, informs debates on what formal mechanisms are needed to account for interactions between morphology and phonology across languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this collaborative IRES project, researchers will study the response and adaptation of dragonflies in different climactic habitats, with the goal of broadening our understanding of the effects of regional and global environmental change on biodiversity. The project will recruit 18 U.S. student researchers to work on projects that are critically important to document and preserve biodiversity and understand the adaptations that allow successful colonization during rapid environmental change. Students will be recruited from traditionally underrepresented groups to build capacity, thereby increasing inclusion, equity, and innovation in the broader research community. Further, students from both the U.S. and Ghana will be mentored by a diverse, interdisciplinary, multi-institutional, and international team, gaining a high degree of professional and personal development through exposure to a variety of expertise at different types of institutions and in different research contexts. Fostering international collaborations is a necessary step for worldwide conservation of biodiversity due to climate change, and this program will facilitate such an endeavor, as the research is a collaboration among three institutions, The Pennsylvania State University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the international host institution University of Cape Coast in Ghana. This collaboration will allow us to leverage student and faculty capacities built over the course of the project to extend to other countries that share similar ecological concerns. <br/><br/>West Africa is thought to be one of the world?s most vulnerable regions to the effects of anthropogenic environmental change and subsequent loss in biodiversity. However, there remains a paucity of information on insect species biodiversity and their distribution in the region, how rapid environmental change affects those assemblages, and the morphological adaptations that may allow insects to adapt to a changing environment. This project will exploit naturally occurring climate ecozones within a small geographic range in Ghana to assess the effects of environmental change, both natural and anthropogenic, on odonate biodiversity and community structuring. Additionally, the project will assess the wing and neural adaptations that contribute to successful colonization of diverse habitats, which may predict insect survival and colonization in a rapidly changing environment. In view of Ghana?s rapid habitat losses and quickly changing landscape, this project offers the first comprehensive faunal studies for databasing, future monitoring, and conservation of the undocumented and underrepresented odonata species of Ghana. Leveraging methodology from material sciences and neurobiology, this project also will link phenotypic variation in morphological attributes (e.g., optical properties, durability of wings, mushroom bodies) with variation in environmental factors across the three ecozones of Ghana. Doing so will elucidate which morphological characteristics allow successful colonization of different habitat types. Overall, this project will extend our knowledge on the effects of environmental change on odonata distributions, as well as the morphological adaptations that correlate with variation in environmental factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This collaborative planning proposal brings together researchers from Iowa State University and the University of Central Florida to lay the groundwork for a collective research collaborative, A Community for Configurability Open Research and Development (ACCORD), that will help to centralize research on configurability and to create shared approaches, tools and solutions.<br/><br/>The proposal includes activities to survey the research community, create awareness across different sub-disciplines, and document common goals and needs via interaction through workshops and outreach. In addition, activities will develop a common framework, set of tools, and vocabulary, including exemplar artifacts that embody the nature of ACCORD. The final ACCORD infrastructure will provide software tools, models, and solutions that work across different communities, along with tutorials and meta-data information that is not obtainable by only searching the literature. Benchmarks for different types of configurable systems will highlight functional, security and performance challenges.<br/><br/>Concepts on configurability and preliminary ACCORD artifacts will be used in the classroom. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the prototyping of designs and artifacts and will help to build a survey of existing research in configurability. Workshops will be held for different sub-disciplines. Students from the Iowa State first-year honors undergraduate program and the University of Central Florida K-12 Camp Connect will be involved in activities related to this project. The planning will include outreach to non-CISE disciplines, e.g. researchers in the Bioinformatics community, who can benefit from the eventual development of ACCORD.<br/><br/>The project website can be found at: https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/mcohen/accord. It will be retained past the lifetime of this grant. All significant artifacts will be archived with a permanent digital object identifier (DOI).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intermolecular forces have profound influence on chemical and physical processes, making it important to understand the delicate balance and competition between different contributions, such as electrostatic and steric effects. Professors Leung and Marshall and their undergraduate students will generate molecular species held together solely by intermolecular interactions and examine their rotational spectra using two types of complementary spectrometers, one with large bandwidth (several thousand MHz) and a narrowband (1 MHz) instrument that also provides enhanced sensitivity. The experimental work, guided and supplemented by computational methods, is expected to reveal the shape of the complexes and hence the nature of the intermolecular forces. This work could lead to a better understanding of the subtle interplay among the intermolecular forces that results in a preferred binding geometry, and could identify useful chiral tags that enable effective conversion of a sample of enantiomers (molecules that are mirror images of each other) into distinct molecular species that have different rotational spectra. This research provides meaningful hands-on experience in modern, state-of-the-art physical chemistry for undergraduate students.  With up-to-date, relevant, modern instrumentation, this research will engage the next generation of scientists in pedagogically effective ways, better prepare them to be responsible citizens in an increasingly technological world, and better position them to contribute in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>Building on a foundational understanding of the intermolecular interactions between haloethylenes and protic acids, the extension from haloethylenes to halopropenes results in greater structural flexibility, with the potential for a finer understanding of the subtle interplay among the forces that lead to a preferred binding geometry for the protic acids. The chiral tagging technique being investigated relies on the conversion of enantiomers, which have identical microwave rotational spectra, into spectroscopically distinct and readily identifiable diastereomers upon complexation via non-covalent interactions to form a heterodimer with a tag molecule of known chirality. Given the known absolute stereochemistry of the tag, the absolute configuration of the analyte and the enantiomeric excess of a sample can be determined in a background free manner. Through a detailed study of the rotational spectrum and the intensities of the transitions of these complexes, this work could provide the benchmarking critical for adoption of chiral tagging as a routine analytical method for determining the enantiomeric purity of a chiral analyte sample. With the ability to obtain a large bandwidth rotational spectrum with consistent source conditions, the chirped pulse technique is particularly advantageous for these studies. The use of computational methods and the narrowband Balle-Flygare spectrometer adds powerful, complementary strength to the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar cells can convert sunlight directly to electricity to power electronic devices by the photovoltaic effect. Currently, state-of-the-art solar energy conversion technologies, for example, silicon solar cells cannot meet the requirements of low cost and high energy conversion efficiency to enable broad use. Alternatively, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a family of promising photovoltaic systems for low-cost and high energy conversion efficiency. To date, PSCs have achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.7% since 2009. The perovskite films are predominantly prepared by the antisolvent-assisted method. The antisolvent-assisted method is not suitable for practical applications in terms of high reproducibility, large-scale production, and large-size devices. This Excellence in Research (EiR) project addresses the use of volatile solvents to prepare high-efficiency perovskite solar cells by a non-antisolvent method. The proposed research method exhibits significant potential in the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films because the film growth is caused by solvent volatilization via a spontaneously and simultaneously supersaturated nucleation strategy. This project will provide a critical understanding of the perovskite precursor prepared and adjusted by volatile solvents and additives to control the high-quality perovskite film growth via a non-antisolvent method. This project will also study the relationship between solvent-solute chemistry and PSC device performance in the non-antisolvent method. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This EiR project, based on adjustable perovskite film growth by non-antisolvent methods and advanced characterization techniques, will provide insights into tailoring the solute-solvent chemistry in crystal growth in the presence of volatile solvents and develop perovskite film growth principles by non-antisolvent methods. The proposed investigations will provide the bridge between film growth and cell performance comprehensively including chemistry bonding, coordination, nucleation and growth, and cell performance. This project will 1) Probe the iodoplumbates evolution during the precursor preparation and perovskite crystal nucleation process during the solvent volatilization and investigate the relationship between iodoplumbates, solvents, and additives in the solution. 2) Investigate film growth in terms of film coverage, thickness, defects, cracks, and pinholes as a function of solvent volatilization, precursor aging, and iodoplumbate coordination complexes. 3) Study the phase transition from wet films to solid perovskite films and the photovoltaic properties of the perovskite films. 4) Optimize the oriented perovskite crystal growth toward high quality, few defects, large grains, large area, and high reproducibility films. This project will lead to a revolution of perovskite film fabrication by non-antisolvent methods via solute-solvent interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowledge screening, including searching and filtering, based on traditional relational databases may suffer from several problems. For example, keyword-based searching and rule-based filtering can only handle limited types of questions and lack flexibility. Over the past few years, modern deep learning methods have alleviated this problem by automatically translating natural language questions into structured query languages. However, if different types of data such as tabular, textual, and heterogeneous graph data are consolidated into a relational database with many tables, structured queries can become very complex, which poses new challenges to deep learning models. This project will tackle these challenges by designing a new paradigm based on non-relational databases that store data in a more flexible non-tabular form. The new paradigm can easily incorporate reasoning into question-to-query translation, enabling deep learning models to handle more complex questions, which will benefit many domain-specific applications. The project will also promote teaching and mentoring activities, such as developing new courses and training of next generation experts in machine learning, natural language processing, data management, and health informatics. The project outcomes and observations will be open for public use.<br/><br/>The project will forge a new research direction for natural language-driven knowledge screening on non-relational databases. Although there are many well-known, efficient, and scalable non-relational databases and search engines, little effort has been devoted to developing natural language querying methods for them and exploiting their potential. This project aims to fill this gap by designing new underlying frameworks for natural language-based searching and querying, including data consolidation in non-relational databases, reasoning integration in both databases and query templates, and human-in-the-loop model development and evaluations. Two primary research activities will be undertaken based on a popular search engine known as ElasticSearch: (1) The investigator will develop new deep learning models for translating natural language questions into ElasticSearch queries and create new datasets for training and evaluating the models. (2) The investigator will propose a unified approach, standard format, and extensible way to create knowledge ?nuggets? to store multi-modal data and develop new question-generation models to automatically generate questions from nested knowledge. The project will produce a variety of outcomes, such as data used for model development, algorithms for model training and inference, and annotation tools used for creating training data. These products will benefit data management and screening, and support decision-making in healthcare, bioinformatics, and scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More information is needed to put recent climate changes into a long-term context of natural climate variability. This information helps to foresee possible future climate trends, especially those that involve slow-moving features of the climate system, which will continue to change over hundreds to thousands of years to come. A variety of geological evidence can be used to extend observations of temperature and other climate variables back in time. This project focuses on reconstructing glacier fluctuations in Alaska, the Arctic region of the United States, as evidence for past climate changes extending back for thousands of years. The research team will estimate past glacier size by studying sediment from glaciers that is carried by meltwater streams and deposited in glacier-fed lakes. The sediment samples collected for this project will also be studied for signs of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to determine how frequently these damaging events have occurred in the past and will likely occur in the future. The project will also help prepare undergraduate and graduate students for careers in the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The extent of glacier cover is a prime indicator of climate. Sediments stored in glacier-fed (proglacial) lakes provide a uniquely continuous record of glacier-size fluctuations. This project will further develop the ability to reconstruct the extent of glacier cover within the catchment of proglacial lakes using basic sedimentary indicators of glacier rock-flour abundance (bulk density, organic matter, particle size, magnetic susceptibility, and accumulation rate). By sampling proglacial lakes along an environmental gradient of heavily to sparsely glaciated catchments in Alaska, the research team will systematically acquire quantitative information about these well-known glacial indicators, which vary with glacier size and other environmental variables. This information will be used to develop a numerical model to estimate past glacier extent based on lake sediment properties measured in sediment cores taken from multiple lakes in south-central and northwest Alaska that extend back to around 15,000 years. In addition to rock-flour indicators, the sediment will be analyzed for terrestrial and aquatic productivity indicators, including organic pigments and biogenic silica abundance, which are amenable to generating time series with decadal-scale resolution. These records will be used to address fundamental questions related to the timing and extent of climate changes in Alaska that occurred following the last major ice age. The ages of the lake sediment will be determined using short-lived radioisotopes, volcanic ash layers, and radiocarbon dating. This project will also contribute to assessing geological hazards related to seismic and volcanic activity near the most populated area of Alaska, supporting and engaging STEM graduate and undergraduate students and early career researchers, and developing scientific resources, including the popular Alaska PaleoGlacier Atlas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, many students fail to reach their potential in these skills. One of the challenges that preschool-aged children face when acquiring an understanding of numbers is distinguishing between numerical magnitudes (like three elephants) and spatial magnitudes (like the size of an elephant). Prior research suggests that children often focus on the size of the objects instead of the exact number of objects (for example, when comparing 3 elephants to 6 mice, children often mistakenly say that there is a greater number of elephants than mice). The ability to flexibly pay attention to both numerical and spatial magnitudes and then determine which magnitudes are relevant for a given situation is referred to as ?flexible attention to magnitudes? (FAM). This project aims to understand the development of young children?s flexible attention to magnitudes skill and how it can best be supported by specific experiences in early childhood. It is hypothesized that this skill is essential to later mathematical thinking and is an important skill for many mathematical activities, such as number line estimation and proportional reasoning.<br/><br/>The proposed studies are designed to identify specific mechanisms that lead to improvements in flexible attention to magnitudes (FAM) skills. The first aim of these studies is to examine the roles of mathematical language and visual experience as potential causal mechanisms that drive improvement in this skill in young children. The second aim is to determine whether improving flexible attention to magnitudes skill has a causal effect on mathematics achievement. The third aim is to test whether an intervention leads to durable improvements in flexible attention to magnitudes skill and mathematics achievement, and far transfer to executive function skills. The fourth aim is to explore whether the impact of flexible attention to magnitudes instruction depends on students? socioeconomic status (SES) and initial number word knowledge. These aims will be tested with young children ages 3 - 5 years via three experimenter-led studies using pretest-intervention-posttest designs. Each study will compare reading books with specific types of FAM content to each other and to an active control. Study 1 will test the effects of mathematical language and Study 2 will examine the role of visual experience on FAM skill and mathematics achievement. Study 3 will examine gains in FAM skill and mathematics achievement at a delayed post-test, and far transfer to executive function skills. Study 4 will pool data from Studies 2 and 3 to provide a well-powered test of SES and number knowledge as moderators of the effects of FAM intervention. These studies will build a theoretical model of how FAM skill develops and impacts other skills, while simultaneously laying the foundation for larger-scale interventions aimed at improving children?s mathematics skills.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program.

These models can be used, for example, to detect insider trading. The second project focuses on a class of equations, known as Backward Stochastic Differential Equations, to better understand strategic behavior of agents in a wide range of competitive environments. Finally, the third project aims to understand the dynamics and the nature of the kinds of random fluctuations one often observes in financial market volatility.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. DNA is the fundamental genetic storage molecule for all cellular life on Earth, yet it is susceptiple to damage by various cellular and environmental processes, which can impair cell survival. Consequently, cells have evolved dedicated DNA repair pathways, collectively known as the DNA damage response (DDR) to recognize and correct mistakes in the genome. When both strands of the DNA double helix are broken, this creates a double-strand break (DSB), and is repaired by a mechanisms called alternative-end joining (alt-EJ), a pathway that stitches two DNA ends back together. The structural basis for how this process works is unknown, but it is important for the evolution of all complex life on Earth. This research will explore the 3-dimensional architecture of proteins and DNAs within the alt-EJ pathway, and will provide a deeper understanding for how organisms protect and repair their genome from damage. This research will also support teaching, mentoring, and outreach by the fellow to improve scientific communication and participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The alternative-end joining (alt-EJ) pathway is a multi-step pathway that is conducted by the DNA helicase/polymerase, Pol theta (Pol?). Alt-EJ is an intermediate DSB repair pathway between non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), and this research will contribute to the understanding of pathway choice. Structurally, full-length Pol? has not been observed in its native context, and the recruitment of Pol? to DNA and coordination with other repair pathways has not been elucidated. The research goals of this proposal involve coupling high-resolution cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and biochemical/phylogenetic techniques to uncover two objectives: (i) the structural basis for human alternative-end joining by Pol? and (ii) the mechanistic evolution of Pol? and alt-EJ using biochemical assays and molecular phylogeny. Alt-EJ complexes will be assembled on magnetic DNA-beads to construct specific macromolecular assemblies for visualization at atomic resolution. The proposed research will provide the fellow with training and development opportunities in structural biology, biochemistry/biophysics, and scientific communication (publications, conferences, seminars).

Development from a single-celled egg to an adult animal relies on the coordination and control of thousands of genes that allows them to be turned on and off in the right cell at the right time. How the regulation of these genes changes between organisms through evolution, and results in Earth?s diversity of life remains a fundamental and unanswered question of biology. Comparisons of the gene regulation that controls development between closely related animals reveals that despite superficial similarity, how development is controlled can vary significantly. This project aims to provide insight into the extent by which gene regulation differs across 13 species of closely related and similar roundworms in order to reveal what allows some genes to change and others to stay the same. Overall, the project will use these roundworms as a model system to expand our knowledge of how development evolves across animals more broadly.<br/><br/>The fellow will use single-cell sequencing to measure the spatiotemporal divergence of gene expression across evolutionary time within the Caenorhabditis nematodes by comparing the transcriptomes of homologous cells and tissues between species across embryonic development. Taking a systems approach, the fellow will help elucidate the constraints on gene regulatory network evolution by building and comparing molecular atlases of development for 13 Caenorhabditis species. The multispecies single-cell atlases will allow for the determination of the rate of divergence of cell and gene expression patterns across the Caenorhabditis genus to test fundamental models in evolution and development. Additionally, using the data and knowledge gained through this project, the fellow will help train the next generation of scientists through a series of computational biology training workshops for summer undergraduate researchers from underrepresented backgrounds. The fellow will also directly train a diverse group of summer undergraduate researchers in the laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In early 2023, major technology companies announced layoffs affecting at least 50,000 people. These layoffs came at a time when tech workers are increasingly critical of their employers? values and practices. As a result, many workers are seeking new means of accountability within and outside the workplace, which could require new principles of software design. A key issue recently has been the role of Human Resources Management (HRM) software in the decision-making that led to these mass layoffs. Media articles reported on the possible role of artificial intelligence (AI) in layoff decisions, based on parameters such as performance reviews and predictions of flight risks. Laid-off employees quickly gathered on online platforms to make sense of the layoffs, including the role of HRM software. While AI-based decision-making is already reportedly common in evaluating performance of gig workers, delivery workers, and other under-paid employees and deciding their futures in the companies, the specific case of software involvement in the management (particularly in the hiring/firing) of a more privileged class of workers is less studied. This project aims to examine the role of existing software technologies in managerial decision-making, while simultaneously developing design principles for better worker-centered accountability tools and techniques applicable for a wide range of techworkers. <br/><br/>The research is supported as a RAPID, because it will quickly collect data of scientific value that unexpectedly became available, while tech workers' experiences and attitudes are still fresh in their minds. It will use survey, interview, and asynchronous remote community methods to collect answers to two important questions: (1) What are some perceptions, meaning-making processes, and folk theories - held by laid-off employees - around the role of technologies (such as HRM software) in the 2023 technology layoffs? (2) How can we leverage these grounded folk theories of layoff technologies towards developing counter-strategies and infrastructures of accountability in the workplace? Interviews with ex-employees will focus on algorithmic decision-making in firing and other processes. The results will help shape theories of how tech layoffs impact both employed and recently laid off workers, and contribute to understandings of the sociotechnical infrastructures of workplace accountability by illuminating the interdependencies between workers, management, and information technologies. Findings and analysis will strive to inform labor policies surrounding workers' rights and protections against algorithmic biases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials consist of domains, the regions where the polarization is oriented in the same directions. FE materials have been used in various electronic devices such as infrared sensors, actuators, and ultrasound transducers. While it is well recognized that the modification of the domain configurations can enhance the electromechanical and dielectric properties of the FE materials, there is a knowledge gap regarding what is the ideal domain size or domain wall density (i.e., boundary regions between adjacent domains) to optimize the macroscopic material properties. The proposed research aims to develop an in-situ characterization method based on the X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS). XPCS can investigate the dynamics of the atomic structures of materials over a range of time from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds in the mesoscale length (1 to tens of micrometers). This range is a critical to explaining the effect of atomistic phenomena on the macroscopic behavior and not efficiently accessible by the current existing techniques, such as X-ray diffraction and piezoresponse force microscopy. The newly proposed method compares the shift of X-ray images under applied electric field. The degree of shift will be statistically analyzed to reveal the mechanisms for electromechanical response in the material, including through continuous domain deformation or discrete domain wall motion. The outcome of this research will be a proof-of-concept of the viability of the above approach for further investigations of the effects of domain wall density and domain size on the FE material properties. Additionally, this proposal includes educational plans aimed at promoting STEM careers among underrepresented minority (URM) groups. These plans involve K-12 outreach initiatives, integrating STEM curriculum for university students, and providing research mentorship to high school and college students from URM groups.<br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The proposed research aims to investigate the fundamental mechanisms behind the ferroelectric (FE) domain engineering through proof-of-concept research distinguishing X-ray scattering behaviors associated with the intrinsic (i.e., domain extension and dipole rotation) and extrinsic (i.e., discrete domain wall motion) contributions to the electromechanical (i.e., piezoelectric) response. The proposed approach by X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) provides a fundamentally new method to investigate the domain and domain wall effects in the mesoscopic (one to tens of microns) range, which is a critical length scale explaining the effect of atomistic phenomena on the macroscopic material behavior. For comparison, the existing techniques based on X-ray diffraction can estimate domain switching on a macroscopic scale, by using the relative intensity of the corresponding diffraction peak. Furthermore, the theoretical estimation is limited to the domain configuration that can be perfectly described by the diffraction peaks used in the calculation. Similarly, while piezoresponse force microscopy can visualize FE domain patterns, it is difficult to characterize the dynamic atomic structure changes at the mesoscale, due to the scanning speed limitations. In contrast, XPCS acquires the scattering signals in a frame to track the pattern shift in all locations over milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. This project will use Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 single crystals to test if the statistical distributions of the XPCS decorrelation functions can distinguish between the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic responses. The goal is to develop a 'two-field' XPCS method and a statistical analysis tool for assessing the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to the piezoelectric and dielectric properties. This project also aims to educate the next generation of engineers and scientists through multidisciplinary research involving materials science, X-ray characterization, and data science. The research outcome will be also used to educate K-12, undergraduate, as well as graduate-level students from underrepresented minority groups through various initiatives, such as outreach activities and innovative curricular efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vigilance decrement, the decline in performance that often occurs when monitoring and screening for occasional and unpredictable signals, endangers health and safety and threatens the efficiency of workers. Vigilance decrement is common in clinical healthcare environments, as clinical environments require shift work and long working hours with limited time for rest. Monitoring vigilance decrement is critical given the impact of vigilance on job satisfaction and productivity of clinicians, patients safety, and healthcare quality. Even so, monitoring of clinical vigilance relies largely on behavioral indicators that depend on retrospective or laboratory-based data,  neither of which is feasible for continuously tracking vigilance levels for individuals in real time in the clinic. To date, no human technology interfaces have been deployed to provide personalized monitoring and intervention to mitigate vigilance decrement in real world clinical operations.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test the research hypothesis that a sensor-based self-monitoring system can reduce vigilance decrement. The anticipated outcomes of this study include (1) assessment metrics for vigilance decrement using physiological responses (i.e., heart rate, skin temperature, electrodermal activity) and eye movement; (2) a framework for predicting vigilance decrement using probabilistic models; (3) a human technology interface that provides personalized interventions to mitigate vigilance decrement; and (4) an evaluation toolkit for measuring the effectiveness of the intervention on vigilance decrement for any high-risk environment. Data collected from field studies, controlled experiments, and usability studies will be integrated into a framework that can be used to monitor and mitigate vigilance decrement. The project will provide insight into how best to model and mitigate vigilance decrement in the clinical environment, with its potential integration into hospital staff scheduling using up-to-date and objective data. In the long term, the monitoring interface using user-friendly and low-cost, lightweight commercial off-the-shelf wearable sensors will make it well suited for use in remote healthcare systems and beyond clinical settings, such as transportation and air traffic control, where operators need to perform demanding tasks under high workload situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our AccelNet represents an advance in methods for engaging in scalable convergence science, as well as how to harness global science to accelerate cultures of learning. We aim to leverage technology, social science, and data science advances to create collaborative resources designed to elevate the global science of learning and education. Typically, one describes engaging with communities of practice as outreach or translation, but in this instance the goal is to reach IN to the communities and let their needs broadly impact the direction of the network science. Our networks have broad reach, allowing cross-functional teams to be assembled that represent many countries, cultures, ethnicities, and demographics from around the globe. Through an active plan to promote diversity, inclusivity, and culturally sensitive learning and research opportunities, we will embark on training the next generation science, education, technology, and policy workforce; our intent is to transform global education by connecting networks with embedded architecture to inform science and amplify the intellectual capital of local community leadership for global impact.<br/><br/>We seek to implement a sustainable ecosystem of communication, synthesis, best-practices, research, and innovation for a network-of-networks designed to accelerate the global science of learning. We will evolve an interdisciplinary network-of-networks, including social science researchers, neuroscientists, psychologists, data scientists, engineers, designers, global development practitioners, philanthropists, educators, and policy makers in order to create cross-cutting infrastructure to tackle pressing challenges in the science of learning to meet the needs of global education. The network leverages resources from four existing networks: the Global Science of Learning for Education Network (GSoLEN), a network of scientists, policy experts, philanthropists, and practitioners all focused on learning and education, the Center for Applied Cognitive Science (CACS), a center specializing on applying cognitive science to relevant problems using culturally appropriate measures and approaches, an educational technology and innovation network, Mind Center for Educational Technology (MindCET), and a global development network, Global Communities. Our AccelNet specializes in global development, learning, education, cross-cultural training, equity, and policy. <br/><br/>We are a learning network-of-networks; learning is the central feature of education and attention to the well-being of learners on local terms promotes parity on global terms. Our AccelNet is designed to promote training of an intellectually agile, interdisciplinary group of scientific leaders, capable of engaging in scientific collaborations for societal good. Engagement with and mentoring of the next generation of scientists within the communities and within the networks will ultimately build a stronger way of doing science. We have selected self-regulation as our prototype research challenge for this AccelNet-Implementation proposal because it is consequential for educational, social, and economic outcomes, yet relatively little is known about the sources of variation underlying it, and how to intervene in contextually and culturally-sensitive ways through practice and policy to promote its development. Self-regulation, a topic relevant to all domains of learning and well-being, including the digital domains, requires large-scale mobilization and thus lends itself to the scale of a network-of-networks. We define self-regulation from the perspective of goal-directed behavior; an individuals' ability to override and manage impulsive actions through inhibiting or redirecting their behavior(s) (Hofmann, Schmeichel, & Baddeley, 2012; McClelland, & Cameron, 2012; Mora & Ozakinci 2013; Montroy et al., 2016). The developmental trajectory of self-regulation is, however, not linear or universal and varies broadly across cultures, countries, and demographics (McClelland & Cameron, 2012; Montroy et al., 2016; Wanless, et al., 2016), mandating synthesis of knowledge from global partners to promote shared understanding and benefit society<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems are attached to clothes or worn directly on the skin for monitoring physical signals, biochemical signals, and motion. Due to the soft, compliant, and complex nature of skin and the natural bending and rotational motion associated with joints, the stretchable electronic polymers should be soft and mechanically robust enough for the wearer to comfortably perform motions such as bending, stretching, and twisting. To prevent long-term performance decline it is desirable for the films to continually heal themselves. Conventional semiconductors, like silicon, are brittle and rigid. Since they are not self-healing, they are unsuitable for many stretchable electronic polymer applications. This work investigates the synthesis, internal structure, self-healing ability, and electrical properties of these dynamic ultra-stretchable systems and utilizes them for wearable electronics, such as sensors. This project's education and outreach activities are combined with the research in a manner that impacts the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. This effort has three main foci: the participation of underrepresented and multi-cultural student groups, improving engineering education at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and outreach to educators & future STEM students. The educational goal of this proposal highlights the role stretchable electronic polymers play in everyday life through the creation of educational YouTube videos reaching thousands of potential STEM students and teachers.<br/><br/>Currently, there is no electronic material that possesses the properties of skin?compliant, elastic, stretchable, and self-healable. This work investigates stretchable electronic polymer systems and the underlying phenomena of these advanced materials?for future applications in healthcare and engineering fields. The fundamental  goal of this work is to understand the relationship between synthesis, internal structure, self-healing ability, and electrical properties of dynamic polyaniline/acidic polyacrylamide/small molecule dopant stretchable electronic polymer systems?to fully understand these stretchable electronic polymer materials and apply them specifically to wearable sensor/electronic functionalities. The technical merit of the work provides new insight into the role of both small molecule dopants and polyacrylamides acidic group content and the overall structure of stretchable, self-healable, conductive polyaniline systems. This project elucidates current stretchable electronic polymer systems by unraveling the electrical/self-healing activity in relation to the internal film structure. This knowledge is cross-disciplinary and aids developments in the fields of sensor/surface science, basic materials science and engineering, etc. The research team investigates the effects of small molecule dopants and acidic polyacrylamides on the synthesis/structure/electrical/self-healing properties and working relationships of dynamic polyaniline systems and links this activity to the internal film structure. Investigating the effects of molecular weight, structure, as well as the number and class of the acidic groups of the small molecule dopants allows the investigator to understand how the intermolecular, thermal, morphological, self-healing, and electrical properties depend on the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding within the material. The acidic groups of the polyacrylamides increase the electrostatic interactions within the material and aid the doping of polyaniline, the electrical properties, and the self-healing ability. Varying the amount and type of acidic polyacrylamides enables the researchers to (i) explore their function  in the electrostatic interactions of the dynamic systems and (ii) understand how the intermolecular, thermal, morphological, and electrical properties depend on the internal film structure. This understanding allows for a thorough investigation of the basic properties (gauge factor, linearity of response, self-healing) of this class of polymer systems for realizable wearable stretchable electronic polymers for medical diagnosis, prosthetics, e-skins, etc. The research contributes to the current theory relating these functional materials to the fundamental understanding of the electrostatic interactions and internal film properties controlling these autonomous self-healable and ultra-stretchable polymers.

In superconductors, vortices consist of supercurrents circulating around a non-superconducting core and are typically unwanted because their motion induces dissipation that often limits the performance of superconducting wires and devices in power, magnet, sensing, and computing applications.  On the contrary, in certain magnetic materials, vortex-like excitations called skyrmions (winding configurations of magnetic moments) form which are predicted to be beneficial for use as information carriers in next-generation low-energy spintronic devices. Mitigating the deleterious effects of superconducting vortices and exploiting skyrmions in spintronic devices for magnetic memory and logic require a microscopic understanding of the complex interplay between vortices, material disorder, and thermal energy. In this work, the research team is investigating this interplay by comparing the rates of vortex and skyrmion motion in materials containing varying amounts of disorder.  This research provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in low temperature measurement techniques, materials growth and microanalysis, and quantum materials physics, necessary skillsets in multiple industries including power, sensing, and computing. Additionally, the principal investigator is reaching out to the local community by organizing an annual Open House Community Day for which families in central Colorado will be invited to the Colorado School of Mines for lab tours, science demonstrations, and hands-on activities.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract: <br/>The interaction of vortices with material disorder is a primary determinant of the electronic and magnetic properties of many systems. In type-II superconductors, vortices are magnetic flux lines that penetrate into the material upon exposure to magnetic fields. In chiral magnets and magnetic multilayers, vortex-like excitations called skyrmions (winding configurations of magnetic moments) can form due to antisymmetric, anisotropic exchange coupling between magnetic moments on lattice bonds. Though the origins of vortices in superconductors and skyrmions in magnetic systems are fundamentally different, striking similarities exist between their dynamics. For example, both can be modeled as particle-like excitations interacting with quench disorder, undergo disorder mediated collective interactions and exhibit glassines. Material disorder immobilizes vortices and skyrmions, whose motion can be induced by sufficiently high currents or thermal energy (thermal creep), or occur via quantum tunneling through disorder-defined energy barriers (quantum creep).  Despite considerable previous research on superconductor vortex dynamics, serious gaps still exist in vortex physics. Creep rates are not predictable and no analytic expression exists that broadly captures the temperature and field dependence of creep. The objective of this work is to understand quantum creep of superconducting vortices and both quantum and thermal creep of skyrmions. To this end, the research team captures creep rates in many superconducting and magnetic materials in a range of temperatures and magnetic fields using magnetization and transport measurements. Subsequent comparisons of creep rates in disparate materials with varied disorder landscapes enables them to draw universal correlations between creep and fundamental material parameters. This research could fill a major gap in the understanding of how vortices overcome different energy barriers and enable efficacious design of defect landscapes in superconductors for many applications and magnetic devices for skyrmion-based spintronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Converting lignin, a largely underutilized yet chemically rich byproduct of the biorefining industry, to valuable aromatic platform chemicals is an energy-intensive process that has made this approach cost prohibitive. Recently, dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells (similar to photovoltaic cells) have emerged as a low-cost and environmentally friendly technology for converting solar energy into chemical fuels or electricity. These photoelectrochemical cells offer a means of using renewable solar energy to drive energy-intensive chemical conversions at ambient temperature and pressure. Here, the collaborative fundamental research project will study how a dye-sensitized photoanode can chemoselectively oxidize lignin with a suitable catalyst as a first step toward a complete light-driven lignin depolymerization process. This approach will expand on the use of heterogeneous catalysis for the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to produce carbonyl or carboxyl compounds for the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries. This work represents a new application for dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells, and the research findings from the project will be disseminated to the public through research publications, conference presentations, and by organizing and hosting educational outreach programs for future professionals in the STEM field. The PIs will also actively recruit and support underrepresented minority students through the outreach program.<br/><br/>Organic oxidation reactions are important in organic synthesis or lignocellulosic biomass processing. Chemoselective oxidation of the aliphatic and/or benzylic alcohol moieties in lignin is a good target for controlling the degradation of lignin to generate desired small molecular products. This project aims to elucidate a photoelectrosynthetic chemoselective oxidation of alcohol moieties in lignin by combining the use of aminoxyl mediators with a dye-sensitized photoanode (DSP) at room temperature. Essential to this approach is the use of a dye-sensitized electrode interface to activate a nitroxyl mediator via light-induced charge separation. This presents both a new approach for driving the photochemical oxidation of the secondary benzylic alcohol and the primary aliphatic alcohol functional groups found in lignin, as well as a new photocatalytic application for dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthetic cells, which have traditionally focused on solar water splitting. The approach will involve (1) the synthesis of photoactive polymeric catalysts and the elucidation of their underlying photochemical electron transfer properties for activating nitroxyl mediators, (2) the fabrication and evaluation of mesoporous semiconductor-based electrodes specifically designed for the chemoselective oxidation of lignin dimer model compounds with a series of nitroxyl mediators, and (3) the elucidation of mechanistic pathways for the light-driven oxidation of 2o benzylic and 1o aliphatic alcohols using a DSP and address practical challenges presented by the use of oligomer model compounds and technical lignin.

Prior research has suggested that certain near-storm environmental conditions may play a large role in determining whether a supercell will become tornadic.  In 2019 and 2022, NSF and NOAA supported an observational campaign to make fine-scale measurements of the conditions around supercells.  This award will apply advanced data analysis and modeling techniques to the observational data collected in that campaign to answer questions about the relationship between near-storm environmental conditions and tornadogenesis.  The societal impact of this project will be found through the increased understanding of the conditions that form tornadoes and the dissemination of findings to the operational meteorological community.  Three early-career researchers will be trained under this award, assuring the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award is for analysis of data collected during the Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS of Supercells (TORUS) campaign that conducted field seasons in 2019 and 2022.  The TORUS project sought to improve understanding of small-scale processes in supercells by elucidating the relationship of storm-generated boundaries and coherent structures within storm outflow to the generation/amplification of near-surface rotation.  Under the TORUS umbrella, this award has the overarching goal of improving understanding of why some supercells produce tornadoes and others do not.  The research team plans to synthesize TORUS observations via multi-Doppler wind syntheses, diabatic Lagrangian analyses, and ensemble data assimilation methods to address three main research foci:<br/><br/>1.	Understanding streamwise vorticity currents (SVCs) and storm-internal boundaries and their relationship to amplification of near-ground rotation in supercells.<br/>2.

It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries.

The team seeks to understand if digital technology can help close the gap between our intentions and actions (e.g., recycling, buying second hand, food waste diversion) when it comes to sustainability. The project team seeks to build upon existing research examining single app use and app use within a relatively homogenous community, to address three questions around (1) how digital technologies become part of our routines, (2) how digital technologies can interact with existing consumption patterns and (3) when do these technologies succeed in shifting behavior (i.e., under what conditions)?

This research project aims to understand more about episodic memory - or memory for specific events or episodes in our lives - and the central role that time plays in it. How do we recall significant life-changing events such as our graduation from high school, or our wedding day, or even ordinary, daily events such as where we parked our car this morning? This research probes how the amount of elapsed time between the occurrence of the event and our recollection of that event affects myriad aspects of our memory. How long ago the event occurred affects multiple aspects of memory function, such as the quality and availability of the memory or whether other memories interfere with the memory of the event we are trying to recall. Another key question is whether memory can be enhanced with additional cues and information. The goal of this research is to develop a unified theoretical model of memory, that accounts for the many effects of time in shaping our memories.<br/><br/>In order to develop the best explanatory and predictive model of memory, this project aims to create and test such an account in the form of a biologically realistic computational model that incorporates recent findings on the neurophysiology of memory systems. An essential aspect to these neural findings is that representations underlying memory - which might be said to form a temporal context - drift over a wide spectrum of time scales, on the order of seconds, minutes, hours, or even days to weeks to months and years. The computational model simulates and replicates these behavioral findings that reveal how temporal context affects episodic memory. An additional goal is to use empirical data from neural recordings over unusually long-time scales to empirically test the extent of dynamic neural drift of memory representations in humans. The model incorporates neural and behavioral data that sheds light on the phenomena that we can often remember the gist of an episode, but over time will forget some of the details of that episode. Finally, it has been shown that representations not only drift, but also suddenly shift at boundaries between events and spatial environments. This project expands our efforts, leading to a more dynamic understanding of the consequences of these sudden shifts both behaviorally and in neural data. In this way, it is possible to achieve a deeper understanding of memory, and how it changes at a behavioral and neural level over time. More broadly, this project also aims to strongly increase the participation of students from historically underserved groups in STEM fields. Knowledge generated from this research is incorporated into courses and workshops at the PIs? university and made freely available for a broader public audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wearable robotic devices, such as exoskeletons, can be used to provide assistive forces to those who have impaired mobility or other disabilities. Although the symptoms driving disability are varied and specific to the individual, current robots do not yet have the intelligence to modify their behavior based on the user?s specific needs. This award supports fundamental research on methods to use measurements of specific deficits in the user?s primary senses to improve how humans and robots collaborate during movement tasks. The results of this research will advance interdisciplinary knowledge in robotics, biomechanics, neuroscience, and control. Reducing the impact of disability and helping people return to work will greatly benefit the U.S. economic and societal goals to advance science and promote human health. The broader impacts of this work include training and research partnerships with local high schools and a nearby historically black university to attract and retain women and underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>To estimate the body?s movement, humans use three primary sensory systems: visual, vestibular, and somatosensory. A major element of the brain?s ability to control movement is to use information from multiple sensory systems to improve the ability to estimate self-motion and sensory feedback. When one of the sensory systems experiences a dynamic loss of accuracy, such as a step transition into soft ground or a loss of vision, the brain compensates by reducing the contribution of the impacted sense to the overall estimation in a process called sensory reweighting. This fundamental research in robot-assisted gait and posture will advance scientific understanding by studying how machines affect the dynamics of the perception of self-motion, cognition, and motor control in the presence of sensory deficits. In the first objective, the researchers will perform experiments with the exoskeleton and virtual reality to identify how exoskeletons affect the sensory reweighting processes in self-paced walking and standing balance. These results will provide novel measurements of the physical and sensory dynamics of human-robot collaboration. In the second objective, they will develop methods to incorporate individualized perceptual models of sensory reweighting into simulations of walking and standing. In the final objective, they will explore methods for real-time detection of sensory reweighting and the usage of haptic feedback as a tool to communicate state and trust between person and machine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, intermittency issues (the wind doesn't always blow) is a critical challenge.  Development of economical, long-duration, utility-scale storage is important for our nation and world.  While compressed air energy storage allows these utility-scale long-duration aspects, key challenges remain in terms of efficiency.  To solve these, a fundamental understanding of the controlling parameters and physics for isothermal compression and expansion efficiency at high pressure ratios is needed.  The proposed research project will enable isothermal compressed air energy storage by identifying the key parameters and thermo-fluid physics that control round-trip efficiencies relevant to full-scale systems.  The disseminated findings can be used to direct development of this technology for effective long-duration wind energy storage, which can ensure a resilient and deeply decarbonized US power grid that enhances our nation's energy security and independence.  In addition, this project supports graduate student research in renewable energy while fostering diversity and inclusion.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify and characterize the primary underpinning multiphase flow and heat transfer factors that control efficient isothermal compressed air energy storage. In particular, the proposed work will employ an optically accessible experimental setup for both compression and expansion that allows pressure ratios of up to 50:1 to identify relevant multiphase flow and heat transfer physics.  In addition, this one-year highly focused experimental effort will characterize isothermal round-trip efficiency in terms of the key non-dimensional parameters.  The project aims, for the first time, to: 1) experimentally test the hypothesis that the newly developed Crowe number and heat exchanger mass loading are the primary non-dimensional numbers that characterize isothermal efficiency, 2) experimentally demonstrate that high round-trip storage efficiency can be achieved at high pressure ratios (ca. 50:1), and 3) identify the key multiphase flow and heat transfer physics that are critical to efficacy of this type of energy storage.  This new research can be transformative for isothermal compressed air energy storage technology development, which can help solve the wind energy intermittency issues in order to allow the nation to achieve a deeply decarbonized grid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This field studies the efficiency, distributional impact, and optimal design of policy in economies in which risk, heterogeneity, dynamic considerations, imperfect commitment, and financial frictions are of first-order relevance. To that end, this project i) develops a general framework to make welfare assessments in environments with risk and uncertainty, ii) explores the welfare implications of assigning different mandates to central bankers, iii) studies the design of corrective regulation with imperfect instruments and multiple regulators, iv) examines the welfare properties of trading in financial markets when agents have different information, and v) explores the welfare consequences of allowing for joint borrowing agreements among different governments. The educational component of this project develops new self-contained materials on how to conduct normative analysis on questions pertaining to financial economics and macroeconomics. This will lower the barriers to entry to normative macro-finance, in particular for policymakers and economists in policymaking institutions. Better understanding of the welfare consequences of economic policies will influence the optimal design and implementation of government policy.<br/><br/>This CAREER project has five components. The first component develops a general framework for making welfare assessments in dynamic stochastic economies with rich individual heterogeneity by introducing the notion of Dynamic-Stochastic weight (DS-weights). This framework allows for a novel, exact, and widely applicable decomposition of welfare assessments. This decomposition opens the door to defining new mandates for policy institutions that were not possible before. The second component explores the welfare implications of assigning different mandates to central bankers in an environment in which optimal monetary policy may be time inconsistent, perhaps because of distributional considerations. The third component studies the design of optimal corrective regulation whenever policies are conducted with imperfect instruments and when there are multiple regulators with potentially different regulatory mandates. The fourth component studies the welfare properties of trading in financial markets when individual investors have dispersed information and markets are incomplete. The fifth component studies the welfare consequences of allowing for joint borrowing agreements among different governments.

This award supports a research effort that combines first-principles calculations, data-analysis procedures, and analytical and numerical modeling of black holes, which will be used to extract insights from gravitational-wave observations. Many of the calculations will be carried out by graduate students, who will be trained in techniques that are useful in physics research and other quantitative areas. A final component of the award will be short essays about the general themes of black holes and gravitational waves, to help introduce these subjects to a wider audience of fiction and non-fiction readers. The writings will be free to read on the research website of the PI. <br/><br/>More specifically, the goals of this project will be to make advances in gravitational physics in several directions. (i) The PI and students will compute persistent gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes using consistency relations determined from recently identified conservation laws in asymptotically flat spacetimes; the detection prospects of these signals will be assessed. (ii) They will model the waves of the persistent observable called the gravitational-wave memory, which has the best chance of being detected from binary mergers. With their improved model, they will reassess the significance of the memory effect in the observed black-hole mergers. (iii) They will improve the computation of gravitational waves emitted from black-hole binaries with large mass ratios that are surrounded by dense distributions of dark matter. The dark matter and its interaction with the binary will be modeled more accurately, which will help produce smaller biases in the data analysis and parameter estimation forecasts. (iv) They will develop gravitational waveforms for mergers of black holes in modifications of Einstein?s theory that cover all the stages of the merger process. These approximate waveforms can help reveal a simpler picture of the more complicated phenomenology of the merger and could be used in gravitational-wave tests of general relativity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graph analysis has been central for multiple communities, including the classical graph theory community, network analysis, graph optimization, as well as the modern day graph learning communities. Traditionally, graphs are regarded as purely combinatorial objects. However, as applications of graphs proliferate, they tend to be regarded as much richer structures. For example, a graph might be viewed as a noisy skeleton of a hidden geometric domain, and there could be rich, complex data associated with its nodes or edges. While this viewpoint is not new, existing algorithmic treatments of graphs have not yet fully leveraged this perspective. In this project, the investigators aim to further integrate various (geo)metric and topological perspectives into graph analysis in order to enrich graph analysis algorithms and broaden the range of methodologies one can use to tackle diverse graph related tasks. This project will integrate ideas and notions from metric geometry, applied topology, spectral geometry and also algorithms to develop new perspectives and effective methods to analyze complex graphs. It will inject new ideas to graph analysis and learning, while at the same time also advancing the field of geometric and topological data analysis. Given the ubiquity of graphs data, methods resulting from this project can potentially impact various application fields, from scientific domains such as molecular biology, materials science, neuroscience, to engineering domains such as chip design. Results from this project will be integrated into the data science curriculum, strengthening the workforce by training undergraduates and graduates in data science.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigators will consider a range of important problems related to the study of individual as well as of collections of graphs. A central theme of this project is to view graphs as objects enriched beyond their combinatorial structures. Two specific research thrusts that the investigators will focus on are: (1) various graph distances, trade-offs between their discriminating power and computational complexity, and potential applications in graph sparsification and in the study of graph neural networks; and (2) modeling, recovering and using (potentially higher order) structures in graphs. To tackle the challenges emerging from these two research thrusts, the investigators will use various metric and topological methods. Examples include viewing graphs as metric spaces and bringing in topological tools (e.g., the interleaving distance from applied topology) to compare them; viewing graphs as metric measure spaces so as to use optimal transport ideas; and bringing together topological persistence through the high dimensional Laplace operator to study spectral structures induced by graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Parental care is critical for offspring survival, and thus, the parents? reproductive success. However, as animals form new populations, environmental pressures might change in ways that also change parental strategies. For example, new populations may no longer need to protect young as extensively from predators, or may have access to new resources, such as nesting material that protects or nourishes young. Most research on the evolution of parental behavior compares species that split from each other millions of years ago. However, we know little about how natural selection shapes parental behaviors when populations are just starting to differentiate. This research will examine how parental care behaviors have been evolutionarily lost in a new population of three-spined stickleback fish (Gastereous aculeatus), a species in which fathers typically care for young. Alogether, this project will provide insight into how environmental changes, including those caused by humans such as climate change, may lead to changes in parental behavior and animal reproductive strategies.<br/> <br/>This research will examine how natural selection has shaped endocrine and behavioral phenotypes in recently-diverged populations of stickleback by (1) comparing differences in neural hormone sensitivity in the brain and (2) hormone production machinery in the gonads (i.e., enzymatic pathways) across breeding stages, and (3) using cutting-edge transgenic tools to functionally test links between genotype and behavioral phenotype in both populations. With this integrative and comparative approach, this research will uncover how novel behavioral strategies emerge both within individuals and between populations at microevolutionary timescales. The fellow will receive training in current bioinformatic analysis and functional neurogenomics using transgenics. The fellow will also contribute to broadening participation of underrepresented groups by cultivating support for mothers/parents in science, including at scientific conferences. The fellow will also mentor community college students, a population often excluded from undergraduate research, through an established NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduate program.

Lasers are an important tool for both fundamental science and commercial applications, but the light intensity delivered by the most powerful systems is limited by damage to their glass and metal optics. Plasma can withstand much higher light intensity than glass or other solid materials without being damaged. Plasma could therefore enable the miniaturization of ultra-high-power lasers, but taking advantage of this robustness in practical devices has proven difficult. This project uses detailed measurements of the optical properties of plasmas to improve the performance of plasma optics and integrate them into the design of short-pulse laser systems. Specific objectives are the improvement of plasma optic stability and the development of optics with properties suitable for use in larger systems. The overall goal is to develop laser architectures that integrate plasma components effectively, ultimately enabling higher power in smaller laser system footprints.<br/> <br/>This project will investigate the use of volumetric plasma transmission gratings in the design of chirped-pulse-amplification femtosecond laser systems, with the goal of developing architectures suitable for compact multi-petawatt lasers. Pump lasers can be used to shape plasmas with wavelength-scale optical-quality variations in density, allowing the creation of plasma transmission gratings and other diffractive optics. This type of plasma optic is relatively resilient to plasma density imperfections and further improvements in optical quality and stability could enable the replacement of solid-state diffraction gratings with plasma analogues, dramatically shrinking the size of the optics required for high-power femtosecond systems. This project focuses on the scientific and practical issues between demonstration of optical control with a plasma grating and the development of terawatt-scale plasma-based pulse compression, including grating stability, energy scaling, and the design of an optimal compressor architecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the short-term, governments help stabilize business cycles. Fiscal transfers, such as stimulus checks, have recently become an important tool in alleviating US recessions. Two projects funded by this award quantify how large stimulus transfers should be and to what extent they stabilize regional business cycles in a fiscal union. Over longer periods of time, governments are responsible for regulating new technologies and managing their consequences. New challenges brought to the fore by digital and automation technologies motivate the remaining three projects funded by this award. The projects investigate the misuse of artifical intelligence to support surveillance states, the optimal regulation of digital industries where data can lead to concentration, and how governments should manage episodes of labor reallocation where new technologies displace workers. By informing policy, these projects will benefit disadvantaged populations in the US who are disproportionately impacted by recessions and automation, foster US national security interests and democratic stability, and help ensure the US remains a leader in the digital industries of the future. The educational component of this award will disseminate the research findings to policymakers and journalists, as well to graduate students through a tutorial ran by the National Bureau of Economic Research.<br/><br/>The projects funded by the award advance our understanding of core issues in macroeconomics, but also connect to broader questions in political economy, industrial organization, and labor economics. The first project recognizes that households' marginal propensity to consume out of a stimulus transfer varies with its size. A key determinant of such size-dependence is the durability of goods. The project develops a state-of-the art model of durables demand, calibrates it to match key moments in US micro-data, and uses it to quantify the optimal size of stimulus transfers. The second project applies a semi-structural methodology for policy counterfactuals to state-level US data to construct a US economy without fiscal integration. The third project collects global data on facial recognition AI trade. It documents new facts about US and Chinese exports of this surveillance technology to autocracies and democracies. The fourth project builds a model of the life-cycle of oligopolistic industries, such as digital industries where data is a key input. The equilibrium features an initial firm entry phase, followed by a shakeout and later industry  concentration. The model is calibrated to match US data on digital industries and is used to study optimal industry regulation. The last project begins from the observation that worker displacement is a common feature of many episodes of labor reallocation, such as those induced by automation or the transition to clean technologies. Displaced workers face reallocation and borrowing frictions in such episodes. The project develops a heterogeneous agents model which incorporates these frictions. It uses it to study second best policies that slow down technological adoption or help worker reallocation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

General Relativity is a comprehensive description of observed gravitational phenomena on scales ranging from micrometers to the size of the visible universe.  Quantum physics describes, to a high degree of precision, the molecular, atomic and subatomic regime.  Despite the success, unresolved questions remain in cosmology and quantum gravity, and so physicists worldwide conjecture that the two theories are merged in some unknown unified theory.  Recent scientific literature reveals that experiments and observation could possibly find violations in the foundations of General Relativity theory.  Such foundational principles include the notion of spacetime symmetry.  For example, local experiments should not favor any special direction in space, according to General Relativity.  However, models of quantum gravity suggest that this principle may be broken in a miniscule but detectable way.  The work supported by this award involves theoretical calculations of signals for spacetime symmetry breaking in experiments and observations.  The focus will be on using astrophysical phenomena like black holes and gravitational waves.  One of the important aspects of this award is financial support for undergraduate research in theory.  This has the impactful feature of not only assisting the PI in the work, but also giving research experience to students, thus contributing to their education and increasing the likelihood of future STEM careers.  Outreach opportunities by the PI and students are also supported.<br/><br/>The work in this award on tests of the foundations of General Relativity will use a broad test framework, based on effective field theory.  Signals for spacetime-symmetry violations, like local Lorentz violation and diffeomorphism symmetry violation, will be calculated for black holes and gravitational waves.  Within the effective field theory framework, strong-field gravity solutions for the spacetime metric for black holes, modified by generic spacetime-symmetry violation, will be constructed, representing a new step forward in this area.  Modification to gravitational wave generation is to be studied, complementing existing analysis on propagation effects.  The work is closely tied to finding specific observables that can be tested against experiments and observations.  Thus, the award supports theoretical work that will provide motivation and additional areas in which to search for new physics beyond General Relativity, in particular, in gravitational wave observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their acquisition and utilization are essential for all life. Yet, many genes involved in the process of element acquisition are unknown. The hypothesis tested in this proposal is that genes underlying element acquisition can be detected by using their evolutionary conservation. This research uses plant genetic datasets from five diverse species (the model plant Arabidopsis, maize, sorghum, soybean, and rice) to identify genes in conserved regions of genomes that direct elemental accumulation. Mutants in these genes in Arabidopsis, maize and sorghum will be identified and characterized to determine the mechanisms of element accumulation. Comparing the results of the characterization experiments to the predictions will enable refinement of the comparative approach. The approach will also be extended to utilize data from different environments in each species permitting exploration of interactions between genes and environments in any organism. This approach is extendable to all species that can be sequenced, including other crops. Knowledge of the mechanisms of elemental homeostasis is critical to understanding plant adaptation and necessary to reduce fertilizer requirements in crops. To expand the community of scientists, we will integrate our bioinformatics and genetics research into undergraduate classrooms, bring undergraduates into the lab, conduct after-school activities for middle schoolers, and produce a podcast for scientific trainees and the research community.<br/><br/>Elemental acquisition and utilization are fundamental to metabolism in all cellular life. Plants change their metabolism and physiology to accommodate many-fold differences in element availability. Previous work used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of elemental accumulation across five species and determined that, more often than expected, orthologous genes are present within confidence intervals of these quantitative trait loci. To validate the predictions of gene function, this project will analyze loss-of-function alleles from sequence-indexed mutant populations of Arabidopsis, sorghum, and maize for effects on elemental profiles. Among the orthologs in the GWAS experiments are genes likely involved in elemental transport and transcriptional regulators of this process. This project will explore the biology of a subset of candidate genes to determine the aspects of cell biology and gene expression they control. The project will carry out mechanistic investigations of these genes consistent with their functional annotation (e.g., transcription factor; transporter). The orthologous approach not only permits the combining of multiple GWAS experiments across species, but also can create lists of orthologs affecting environmentally contingent or population-specific variation. The project will extend the method to incorporate experiments across multiple environments and multiple population types into the orthology-based approach.

This project will address this opportunity gap when blind and visually impaired youth, their caregivers, their educators, and software developers iteratively co-design and evaluate a digital learning environment that teaches computer science through music programming. In this learning environment, youth (ages 12-17) will write code to compose music and to remix music samples from popular contemporary artists. Specifically, this project will result in a more accessible version of EarSketch, a widely-used online platform for learning to code through music programming. This project will also result in associated professional learning and teaching materials for educators of blind and visually impaired youth. Research will explore whether and how the digital learning environment results in numerous positive outcomes among the youth who use it. Ultimately, this project is likely to address the underrepresentation of blind and visually impaired people in computing fields through resulting in an accessible, engaging, freely-available, widely-disseminated platform for learning to code through auditory mediums.<br/><br/>Blind and visually impaired youth, their families, educators, educational researchers, software developers, and music programmers will be involved in the iterative co-design and evaluation of an accessible digital learning environment that teaches coding through music programming. Participatory design studies will explore the elements of the digital learning environment that afford music programming and computing education for learners who are blind or visually impaired. These design studies will entail thematic analyses of interviews, focus groups, and concurrent protocols with educators at schools for the blind, blind or visually impaired youth in middle or high schools, and their caregivers. Observation studies of blind or visually impaired software developers and music programmers will provide further information about elements of accessible coding platforms. Additionally, mixed methods research will explore whether and how the digital learning environment fostered content knowledge gain, interest development, feelings of belonging, and intent to persist in computer science among middle and high school students who are blind or visually impaired. Analyses of validated pre- and post-surveys, as well as student interaction logs and interviews, will provide information relative to whether and how the learning environment fostered positive outcomes in these domains. The no-cost, field-tested, empirically based learning environment will be widely disseminated through numerous professional networks for researchers and practitioners. Additionally, teachers from schools for the blind across the country will have opportunities to participate in professional learning sessions on how to use the learning environment and its associated curricular materials. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 (DRK-12) program, which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Growing evidence has associated specific bacteria in the microbiome with both acute conditions and chronic illnesses, but current technologies to mitigate specific microbial threats in the microbiome are extremely limited and underdeveloped. The total addressable market in the US for screening and therapeutics for microbiome-associated diseases exceeds 18 billion USD and the space for targeted prophylactics has remained virtually empty. This approach is both low-cost and scalable and presents an example of the utility of targeted interventions in the microbiome to give agency to patients and physicians for better management of the risk of diseases associated with the microbiome. <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel approach for massively parallel engineering of bacteriophages to target specific bacteria in complex microbial communities. This pipeline determines which mutations drive activity and specificity in phages and uses a new high throughput method to incorporate curated mutations in complex phage cocktails with thousands of user-designed variants to precisely eliminate targeted bacteria. Compared to traditional approaches for developing phage cocktails, this approach represents increased throughput by nearly four orders of magnitude. This approach has been leveraged to create phage cocktails that eliminate bacteria in the gut microbiome strongly associated with the development of different diseases.

The very heaviest elements are the actinide elements and include uranium and thorium. Although these elements are very important in nuclear energy and in the handling of, e.g., nuclear waste, their chemistry is not understood nearly as well as that of lighter, more common metals. Even the types of chemical bonds that the actinide metals can form are not well established. This project will prepare new classes of uranium and thorium compounds where the metals have unusually low oxidation states and are attached to other atoms through multiple chemical bonds. This knowledge is important for differentiation of these elements from other metals to enable chemical separations, and for discovering future unique chemistries. An important goal of this research program is to integrate the uses and properties of the actinide elements into the curricula of high school, college, and graduate students. As the average age of chemists trained in handling actinide elements increases, it is essential to prepare the next generation of scientists in this area of national need. Toward this end, the project includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students in f-element chemistry and outreach components to educate high school students in the area. In addition, a series of programs aimed at aiding the mental health of graduate students will be conducted.<br/><br/>This project will explore the degree of covalent bonding in actinide compounds. The approach is to perform synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of reduced uranium and thorium complexes for organometallic processes and small molecule activation. Specific aims include synthesizing U-pnictogen (Pn) single and multiple bonds with substituents that have varying steric and electronic properties, and to study the effect of soft donor ligands on actinide electronic structure and covalency. The formation of new thorium(III) derivatives from strong reducing agents will also be explored, as thorium is typically found in the +4 oxidation state. These understudied compounds are expected to have interesting electronic structures that will be important to study to understand potential applications. The work proposed includes synthetic methodology development, spectroscopic analysis, magnetization measurements and computational approaches to fully understand the electronic structure and reactivity of these important and underexplored low valent organoactinide compounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These therapeutics, such as antibodies, cell and gene therapies, and vaccines, can deliver excellent results when they work, but available therapies do not work for all patients. To develop and deliver the next generation of therapies to improve the lives of patients, investigators need to be able to understand how immune cells and other cells move, interact, kill, and survive over time.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This project will explore the impact of soil carbon complexity on microbial growth and interactions between microbes competing for limited carbon resources. Soil carbon can be broadly categorized as either readily available for microbial consumption (labile carbon) or difficult for microbial populations to metabolize (recalcitrant carbon). In order to utilize recalcitrant carbon, microbes must first break these complex compounds into their building blocks while also defending these building blocks from theft by neighboring microbes. To this end, microbes which specialize in the metabolism of recalcitrant carbon utilize antimicrobial compounds to prevent their neighbors from stealing these resources. These antimicrobial compounds are also believed to play a significant role in the suppression of soil-inhabiting, plant-pathogenic, organisms. As rising global temperatures are anticipated to increase the relative proportion of recalcitrant carbon within the soil, soil-inhabiting microbes are anticipated to alter their production of and resistance to antimicrobial compounds to further their ability to compete for these complex resources. Through this fellowship, the PI will further our understanding of how the adaptation of microbes to increasingly prominent recalcitrant carbon will influence interactions between soil-inhabiting microbes. The results of this research will be vital in promoting soil health and will ensure the protection of food crops from soil-inhabiting pathogens. Furthermore, this fellowship will further the training of the fellow, research personnel, graduate, and undergraduate students at the University of Minnesota as well as promote the participation and training of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>In this research, isolates of Streptomyces, a genus of prominent, soil-borne, antibiotic-producing bacteria, will undergo long-term selection for growth in petridishes containing a sole carbon source of varying recalcitrance. Isolates will be dotted on plates and grown until they exhibit sporulation. Spores will then be transferred to subsequent plates for a total of fifty generations of selection on either recalcitrant or labile carbon. It is anticipated that growth on recalcitrant carbon sources, in contrast to labile carbon, will impart selection for the utilization of a wider range of carbon sources and will increase the frequency and intensity of constitutive antibiotic production. Following fifty generations of growth, the fellow will characterize changes in isolate nutrient use and inhibitory phenotypes as well as genomic and transcriptional changes associated with carbon metabolism and secondary metabolite production. The results of this project will provide insight into the genomic and transcriptional modifications resulting from selection for growth on carbon sources of varying recalcitrancy. This project will further the fellow?s training in microbial ecology and genomic analysis as well as mentorship and scientific communication. The fellow will also recruit undergraduate researchers to train the next generation of scientists.

Space is filled with plasma consisting of approximately equal amounts of negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions. Our nearest star, the Sun, ejects large quantities of fast-moving plasma, called the solar wind, toward the Earth. This plasma is relatively cold  but is rapidly heated when it encounters magnetized planets. The Earth?s magnetic field partly shields us from the solar wind, but this shield can also break via a mechanism called magnetic reconnection. It is not well understood why the plasma inside the Earth?s magnetic shield, the magnetosphere, is so hot when compared to the solar wind, and this award will enable a collaborative team from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and the University of Wisconsin - Madison to help address this question.  The project will also contribute to our understanding of space weather and educate, mentor, and support two Ph.D students as well as three scientists from under-represented groups.<br/> <br/>The universality of particle acceleration, heating and transport in plasmas remains a major challenge in plasma physics, space physics, and astrophysics.  In laboratory plasmas, the length-scales are shorter and time-scales are faster than for physical processes in space plasmas, making it a challenge to measure and identify the specific physical mechanisms responsible. In space, the in-situ measurements probe plasmas at their natural scales, but the spatial distribution of probes is very sparse. Recent multi-spacecraft observations and numerical simulations have revealed generation mechanisms of large-scale magnetic bottle structures (diamagnetic cavities) at the Earth?s dayside magnetosphere where thermal particles of tens of eV can be accelerated to suprathermal energies of greater than 40 keV.  However, the detailed physics of the particle acceleration has remained elusive.  This project will answer the following science questions: (1) What is the detailed physics for electron energization by reconnection (e.g., betatron vs. Fermi) in the environment of a diamagnetic cavity (DMC)?; (2) What is the time-scale of formation of the DMCs in high-Lundquist number plasmas?; (3) How do the electron plasma properties change in the DMC with respect to external electron parameters in high-Lundquist number laboratory plasmas and what controls the fraction of reconnected flux compared to flux convected around the dipole field?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While some eruptions are explosive, others erupt without major explosive behavior, leading to different natural hazards for each eruptive style. These distinct eruption styles are controlled by the fundamental physical properties of magma, particularly viscosity, and density. The viscosity of magma is highly dependent on the atomic-scale structure of the magma, influenced by magma composition, temperature, pressure, and the presence of dissolved gasses such as water vapor. In this study, the researchers aim to obtain fundamental physical constraints on the structure and viscosity of magma at conditions relevant to the Earth?s interior. We will combine the experimentally derived physical properties of magma and fluids with numerical simulations to predict how magmas migrate from the Earth?s subducting plates. It is the migration of this material that ultimately leads to eruptions at the surface, but the complex role of viscosity in magma transport makes it difficult to trace material from its source in the interior to the surface. The project will  provide training for the next generation of Earth Scientists at various stages of their career, including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral scholars.  <br/><br/>Although extensive research has been done to constrain the elastic and transport properties of fluids and melts at conditions relevant to the Earth?s interior, the combined effects of pressure, temperature, and dissolved water remain poorly constrained at the conditions of the upper mantle where these melts are produced. This research will couple lab- and synchrotron-based experimental data to pressures up to 20 GPa with first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations, with the objective to determine the local melt structure, and fluid and melt viscosity to high pressures and temperatures. This work will quantify the structure and properties of aqueous fluids with dissolved albite, in addition to albite and basaltic melts with and without water. The results will provide insight into how pressure, temperature, and composition affect the structure and viscosity of polymerized aluminosilicate melts at mid-mantle depths and illuminate the causes of observed pressure anomalies on viscosity. The resulting viscosities will be integrated into two-phase flow models in the slab-arc system and the upwelling region above the mantle transition zone to assess the pathways of melt migrations through state-of-the-art geodynamical models. These models will assess how the pattern of fluid migration changes with slab age and subduction rate, slab thermal structure, and the distribution and volume of fluid sources in the subducting slab. The resulting work will assess the impact of fluid volumes due to melting and whether melting alone is sufficient to focus melts into a narrow region beneath volcanic regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In each of these English examples, ""it is snowing"" looks the same, but in many other languages including the language of interest in this project, speakers use different grammatical structures to express the proposition in each context. These different grammatical structures are called ""clause types,"" and fluent speakers use them to convey a wide range of nuanced meanings. This project elucidates how these configurations are used by native speakers. This informs a theoretical linguistic understanding of clause typing generally while also supporting the needs of the community by documenting valuable linguistic data and teaching learners how the language functions. In the absence of everyday immersion environments where learners would have the rich and varied contexts necessary to acquire the nuances required for mastery of the language, linguistic analysis provides generalizations of native speaker grammar patterns for learners to emulate.

We know that mosquitos locate and bite humans by their sensitive sense of smell.  However, mosquitoes do not bite everyone equally ? some people are bitten more than others. What causes this difference in the mosquito?s biting preference? Remarkably, mosquitoes can learn and remember based on past experiences, particularly the experience of having an animal or person swat at them. The experience of being the target of a swat can modify their odor and biting preferences, but we know remarkably little about how this information is processed in the mosquito brain. This project will use an interdisciplinary approach that combines novel behavioral and electrophysiological techniques from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to understand how odor learning takes place to modify their biting behaviors. These projects will also incorporate training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates with the aim of preparing them for independent scientific careers. High School students in the Upward Bound Program will also participate in the project through summer seminars and lab experiences. <br/><br/>In this project, we build on our recent findings that dopamine-mediated learning and modulation in the mosquito?s primary olfactory system, the antennal lobe, is critical for Aedes aegypti mosquito host preferences. Using an interdisciplinary approach, our collaborative team will elucidate the role of dopamine-mediated plasticity in olfactory circuits. We accomplish this with three Objectives: (1) We will test the hypothesis that mosquitoes only learn certain odors, corresponding to the tuning of specific antennal lobe glomeruli. (2) To test that ?learnable? odors are encoded by antennal lobe glomeruli that receive dense dopaminergic innervation. And (3) to test the hypothesis that coincident dopamine and odor input cause plasticity of antennal lobe project neurons and allows mosquitoes to learn important olfactory stimuli. We suggest that our proposed experiments may provide a basic framework for understanding the contribution of dopaminergic plasticity in early olfactory circuits. Moreover, olfactory behaviors, including learning, are critical for mosquito preferences and biting of human hosts, and thereby spread diseases that afflict nearly a billion people annually. Therefore, unraveling the neural bases of learning in mosquitoes has important potential for developing new strategies for their control. The project will also introduce students to interdisciplinary research and broadly communicate insect neurobiology's importance to high school students.

Fractals are spaces that possess either a degree of self-similarity, or roughness, or both, and randomness refers to uncertainty in these patterns. Non-uniform geometry here means that the geometric features of the given objects do not adhere to the same quantitative standards across all locations and scales. Within mathematics, substantial interest in the study of fractals comes from their applications in the theory of dynamical systems. Outside of mathematics, fractals have numerous applications, for instance, in antenna design, terrain analysis, and target recognition. This project revolves around questions and problems regarding surface uniformization and simultaneous conformal welding, in particular, in the presence of randomness. The principal investigator will adapt and extend conformal uniformization and welding techniques to new non-uniform and fractal dynamical settings. The investigator also intends to mentor students at various levels, from high school to Ph.D., and foster research in the actively evolving field of fractal geometry and dynamics.<br/> <br/>The geometrically non-uniform objects considered in this project are metric curves and spaces that are not quasisymmetrically equivalent to circles, equilateral triangulations, etc. Examples of such spaces are abundant in the dynamics of quadratic polynomials, in conformal welding problems, and in random uniformization. One specific goal of the project is to introduce a new class of random surfaces spread over the sphere and to consider the type problem for surfaces of this class. In the case when such surfaces are (almost surely) parabolic, the value distribution properties of associated functions, particularly the order of growth of such functions, will be investigated. Another goal is to develop simultaneous conformal welding tools and techniques that in turn will extend recent results on merging reflection groups with critically fixed anti-rational maps. The methods to be employed are complex analytic in nature. Success in this project will result in new contributions to the growing literature on random surface uniformization and conformal welding, will raise new questions in random value distribution, and will develop new tools which go beyond those employed in current methodology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Muscle is responsible for providing the power that is necessary to live our daily lives ? walking, communicating, and breathing are all possible thanks to skeletal muscle. However, muscle injury, neuromuscular disease, and other impairments can reduce a person?s mobility and cause significant pain because the muscles are too stiff. This project is to investigate how the stiffness and biology of healthy muscle is different from that of impaired muscle. In particular, it is currently unknown how molecules that compose skeletal muscle contribute to the mechanical properties, particularly to muscle stiffness. The project will investigate how three key parts of skeletal muscle contribute to muscle stiffness ? a) muscle cells, b) a web-like tissue called the extracellular matrix, and c) the cellular liquids in muscle. The research team will use experimental testing complemented by computer models to generate data. This data will help scientists and clinicians better to understand what specific mechanisms of a disease change muscle stiffness. The results will contribute to improving treatments for people who suffer from such muscle conditions. This grant also will support educational outreach to mentor a diverse group of undergraduate student researchers and support their professional development in careers in the sciences.<br/> <br/>This work will establish critical structure-function mechanisms in passive skeletal muscle by leveraging multiscale materials testing and finite element analysis. While changes to muscle stiffness from impairments correlate to measurements such as collagen content and type, predicting the hyperelastic, anisotropic material properties of muscle in vivo is not possible. The research team will perform multi-axial materials testing on individual muscle fibers, muscle tissue, and whole muscle under both tensile and compressive conditions. These experimental data will comprise the most comprehensive set of muscle material properties collected to date and will be used for the calibration and validation of a multiscale, biphasic, homogenized finite element model of muscle tissue that links microstructural form to macro function. This model can then be used in future efforts to study how microstructural changes to muscle tissue alter muscle material properties and thus in vivo function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research is important because the largest 1% of trees contain enormous amounts of carbon: about half of all carbon stored in plants of these forests. However, we do not know what kills these trees and therefore can?t predict how they might fare in the future or their impact on climate. Gigante will use drones to guide field teams to locate and describe thousands of giant tree deaths in tropical forests around the world. These data will then be used to predict when and where other giant trees will likely die in the future and to improve our understanding of how carbon cycles on our planet today. Gigante?s outcomes are crucial to a better understanding of how vulnerable tropical forests are to environmental change. The project will train new and aspiring scientists across an international network in the use of modern technology for studying giant trees, generate publicly accessible data on all giant tree deaths to help satellite experts and others monitor forests, and generate new software and training materials to help scientists and land managers monitor the health of forests worldwide.<br/><br/>Gigante will locate giant tree mortality events using multi-platform, high-frequency remote sensing of 7,500 hectares of tropical forest across five ?super sites.? These data will facilitate targeted field surveys using detailed state-of-the art protocols to assign proximate agents of mortality to recently dead trees in an unprecedentedly large field study. The researchers will integrate these data with information about climate, topography, canopy structure, and tree traits to validate mechanistic models of tree mortality risk. Finally, combining these risk models with forest plots and satellite LiDAR, they will evaluate how drivers of giant tree death predict spatial variation in forest dynamics, structure, and carbon storage. In the course of this project, Gigante will produce software and videos to facilitate the use of these methods elsewhere, and provide training and capacity building to scientists across this collaborative network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process occurs on many different length scales and plays an important role in living systems: nuclear proteins coarsen into condensed droplets, bacteria coalesce into multicellular aggregates, and animals aggregate into large groups. The dynamics of these biological systems are typically driven by long-range communication between the elements. It is currently not clear, however, how this communication and the motion of the elements are coupled and result in coarsening. This award will focus on the coarsening dynamics of clusters of Dictyostelium discoideum cells, an amoeboid system. These cells form small and isolated clusters that subsequently move together and coarsen into larger and larger ones. The communication in this system is provided by a secreted chemoattractant, a chemical that directs the motion of the cells and clusters. <br/><br/>This award will quantify the dynamics of coarsening by measuring the number and size of clusters and the secretion of the chemoattractant as a function of time. In addition, the study will use traction force microscopy, a technique that uses beads on deformable substrates, to quantify the forces exerted by the clusters when they migrate and coalesce. Together, these measurements will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for the collective migration exhibited by clusters during coarsening. The experimental results will also be used to develop comprehensive mathematical models, which will generate predictions that can be experimentally verified, resulting in a two-way dialogue between experiments and modeling. <br/><br/>In addition, this award will include the training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who will be directly involved in the proposed research. Finally, as part of this project, yearly ?Dicty Days"" will be organized at two local high schools. During these two-day events students will be able to perform simple hands-on experiments to help stimulate their interest in biological physics.

The functionality and resiliency of our built environment heavily depend on the performance of concrete, a widely adopted material in practical applications. However, the high population of microstructural defects in concrete and the environment's catalytic factors diminish the effectiveness of existing technologies against crack nucleation and growth. Thus, concrete structures' durability and longevity are continuously challenged. This project will enable stereochemical biomimicry pathways through which robust organic-inorganic nano additives and cementitious composites are created. Inspired by nature, this research will couple short-chain organic molecules with an inorganic calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) to reduce the disparity between concrete's tensile and compressive strength, achieve superior toughness, and decrease inherent porosity and material permeability. In partnership with chemical, biomolecular and computational materials scientists, this research resorts to state-of-the-art experimental methods to discover new synthesis processes of hybrid materials with enhanced or novel physical and chemical properties and to promote progress in engineering science. Inclusive science communication and evidence-based outreach activities will engage an audience of all ages, from K-12 students and undergraduates to U.S. Veterans, especially belonging to historically disadvantaged groups, to prepare them to participate in a future STEM workforce capable of meeting emerging technological challenges.<br/><br/>It is established that living organisms use organic molecules and stereochemical recognition to fabricate complex materials characterized by robust physicochemical and mechanical properties. Inspired by this process, the overreaching goal of this research is to unravel the stereochemical biomimicry principles that govern interactions between short-chain functionalized organic molecules and C-S-H. The combined computational and experimental approach will test the following central hypothesis: the interfacial stereochemical effects dictate the nanoparticle nucleation, growth, and self-assembly path in reactive colloidal cement systems. Thus, this award addresses knowledge gaps in three areas: (a) the resolution of stereostructural and energetic binding motifs between the C-S-H and organic molecules; (b) understanding the molecular-scale mechanism, thermodynamic, and kinetic control variables regulating C-S-H nucleation, growth, and texture stabilization in relation to the molecular architecture of the organic modifier; and (c) discovery of stereochemical pathways of C-S-H self-assembly in confined cement environment. Resolving these knowledge gaps will allow the rational design of modifiers for targeted interaction with C-S-H, and engineering biomimetics concrete with reduced defect sensitivity, thus enhancing toughness and long-term structural integrity. This project will enable the PI to advance the knowledge base in materials science, colloids physics and chemistry and to establish his long-term career in engineering biomimetic of infrastructure materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this collaborative IRES project, researchers will study the response and adaptation of dragonflies in different climactic habitats, with the goal of broadening our understanding of the effects of regional and global environmental change on biodiversity. The project will recruit 18 U.S. student researchers to work on projects that are critically important to document and preserve biodiversity and understand the adaptations that allow successful colonization during rapid environmental change. Students will be recruited from traditionally underrepresented groups to build capacity, thereby increasing inclusion, equity, and innovation in the broader research community. Further, students from both the U.S. and Ghana will be mentored by a diverse, interdisciplinary, multi-institutional, and international team, gaining a high degree of professional and personal development through exposure to a variety of expertise at different types of institutions and in different research contexts. Fostering international collaborations is a necessary step for worldwide conservation of biodiversity due to climate change, and this program will facilitate such an endeavor, as the research is a collaboration among three institutions, The Pennsylvania State University, the American Museum of Natural History, and the international host institution University of Cape Coast in Ghana. This collaboration will allow us to leverage student and faculty capacities built over the course of the project to extend to other countries that share similar ecological concerns. <br/><br/>West Africa is thought to be one of the world?s most vulnerable regions to the effects of anthropogenic environmental change and subsequent loss in biodiversity. However, there remains a paucity of information on insect species biodiversity and their distribution in the region, how rapid environmental change affects those assemblages, and the morphological adaptations that may allow insects to adapt to a changing environment. This project will exploit naturally occurring climate ecozones within a small geographic range in Ghana to assess the effects of environmental change, both natural and anthropogenic, on odonate biodiversity and community structuring. Additionally, the project will assess the wing and neural adaptations that contribute to successful colonization of diverse habitats, which may predict insect survival and colonization in a rapidly changing environment. In view of Ghana?s rapid habitat losses and quickly changing landscape, this project offers the first comprehensive faunal studies for databasing, future monitoring, and conservation of the undocumented and underrepresented odonata species of Ghana. Leveraging methodology from material sciences and neurobiology, this project also will link phenotypic variation in morphological attributes (e.g., optical properties, durability of wings, mushroom bodies) with variation in environmental factors across the three ecozones of Ghana. Doing so will elucidate which morphological characteristics allow successful colonization of different habitat types. Overall, this project will extend our knowledge on the effects of environmental change on odonata distributions, as well as the morphological adaptations that correlate with variation in environmental factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying these cooperative interactions requires both surface techniques that are capable of single molecule detection and computational tools for quantifying the degree of interactions. Drs. Chilukuri, Hipps, and Mazur and their students will investigate how single molecules interact with one reactive site and how that system impacts beyond other nearby domains using both experimental and computational methods.

High school, graduate, and undergraduate students will be mentored in research, and an undergraduate course in nanoscale physical chemistry will be developed.<br/><br/>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal contributions of both inter- and intramolecular communications to cooperativity on the submolecular level while density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics provide a mechanism for quantifying the role of the substrate, inter and intramolecular interactions, spatial effects, and spin-spin interactions in producing cooperativity in axial complexation. Real-time STM imaging will be used to monitor the reaction between molecules in solution and/or the gas phase and reactive sites on surface supported metal complexes containing two or more reactive sites. Reactivity will be monitored as a function of temperature, reactant concentration, solvation environment, and nature of the support for the metal complexes. Several approaches will be used to model the STM experiments, including the grand canonical ensemble to parameterize the energetics of binding for each distribution over the reactive sites and periodic DFT calculations to provide insight into how electronic distributions affect binding cooperativity at reactive sites. Molecular dynamics calculations will be employed to model solvent effects. By developing a comprehensive model of reaction cooperativity at surfaces, improved predictability of reactivity in surface chemistry, catalysis, and sensor development is envisioned.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Location-to-location differences in currents and waves cause differences in the surface friction felt by the atmosphere, which results in areas of increased vertical motion over these locations. That motion helps transport heat and moisture to heights that influence weather. This study investigates if these processes are important before storms and during storms. If these processes are found to be important, the knowledge obtained will improve weather forecasts. A significant amount of this research will be carried out by a graduate student; thus, contributing to the training of the next generation of modelers with expertise in interaction between the ocean and atmosphere. Modeling tools developed will also help future science investigations of these processes.<br/><br/>This research will improve understanding of the atmospheric responses to momentum-related air-sea coupling processes on fine spatial scales (10 to 40 km) and at shorter timescales (from hours to several days). This project will focus on the Gulf Stream region where horizontal gradient of ocean surface current is large and where impacts on weather are more likely to be large. The Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system will be modified to more different types of models of surface drag because prior work has shown surprisingly strong sensitivity to the surface stress parameterization in high-resolution (2-6 km) two-way coupled ocean/wave/atmosphere models. Four twin experiments will determine the atmospheric sensitivity to winds and waves after accounting for how two-way coupling modifies the waves and currents. In each twin experiment, the two-way coupled model is run to obtain the ocean and atmosphere states. Then the ocean state obtained from the coupled run is prescribed to force the atmosphere without the dependency on currents or waves. Differences between couple runs and between members of each pair are diagnosed. Validation of surface characteristics sensitive to stress parameterization will provide insights about the strengths and weakness of each surface stress parameterization. This project is anticipated to (1) determine how coupling of winds, currents, and waves modifies budgets of heat, moisture, and horizontal momentum; (2) determine the extent to which vertical transport within the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) and between the ABL and free atmosphere is enhanced by wave and current influences on stress; (3) determine how much the enhanced vertical motion and transport in the coupled model contributes to increased convection and storm intensity; and (4) determine how the answers to the above three questions change depending on weather regimes (e.g., boundary layer stability, wind speed, and interaction with atmospheric fronts).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Together these three studies will advance the effectiveness of low-dimensional, nonlinear, and interpretable data-driven methods for achieving new physical insight, improved prediction, and robust control of multi-scale magnetized plasmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biofilms cause infections at many locations in the body.  Bacteria design biofilms differently depending on the location where they live.  New tools that can relate the location where bacteria form biofilms and their strengths are needed and could help scientists find new ways to destroy biofilms.  This project creates new strategies to learn about the homes bacteria build on catheters placed in blood vessels.  The research will seek to understand how blood vessels and blood flow change the design and strength of biofilms. The project is important for helping to create new ways to study and treat infections in blood vessels.  Another focus of the project is mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in STEM outreach.  Graduate and undergraduate students will educate the public about how tools for studying infections can help create new drugs at a local science festival.  Women graduate students will develop STEM career exploration workshops for women undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>Bacterial biofilms are estimated to cause 65-80% of infections.  Biofilms are frequently recalcitrant?resistant or tolerant?to conventional antibiotics.  Current dynamic infection models of bacteria-host interactions are limited to initial bacterial adhesion events or intracellular infections and do not capture biofilm development.  New models are required to advance the understanding of biofilm resilience in host environments and accelerate the development of effective antimicrobials.  Incorporation of the host interface into biofilm models is essential as biofilms are sensitive to changes in microenvironment.  The goal of this project is to engineer, validate, and utilize an in vitro biofilm infection-on-a-chip that effectively replicates a Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm infection on a central venous catheter in physiologically relevant conditions at the host-biofilm-device interface.  Engineering advancements in model design include a window on the microfluidic chip that controls surface interactions between bacteria and endothelial interfaces, a common co-culture growth media, and optimization of biofilm growth conditions to recapitulate biofilms with in vivo characteristics.  The validated model will be used to reveal how the vascular interface influences the development of biofilm structure.  The biofilm infection-on-a-chip will also be utilized to elucidate how variations in venous shear stress modulate biofilm mechanics and vascular inflammatory response at the host-biofilm interface.  The biofilm infection-on-a-chip engineered in this project is the first biofilm infection model to enable direct visualization of biofilm development at the vascular interface in physiological conditions.  Advancing the understanding of biofilm development at the vascular interface is critical for shedding new light on biofilm resilience in the host environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While ET graduates often work alongside engineers and there may be little distinction between their entry-level job descriptions, many encounter barriers to career advancement in the hierarchical engineering field because of their chosen degree path. In addition, the disproportionately large number of Black students in some engineering technology programs compared to engineering directly impacts the number of Black students   who later have the degree credentials often required to enter to the engineering professorate, engineering research careers, and leadership positions in industry. This study will center on the voices, experiences, and knowledge of Black ET students through focus group interviews and surveys in order to gain insight into the factors that led them to their chosen major and their experiences as Black students in ET. The project will also compare the engineering and ET programs at the collaborating institutions and examine whether there are certain engineering majors that are less accessible than others, and whether Black students are concentrated in some ET majors more than others.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this work is to contribute to the identification and removal of systemic and structural barriers and racial inequities in ET undergraduate education. The long-term goal is that the findings of the research will be used to inform interventions and policy changes. Investigating the reasons why there is a disproportionately high percentage of Black students in ET compared to engineering will shed light on the complex social terrain that Black students must navigate to combat the structural barriers in education to achieve an undergraduate college degree generally, and an engineering-related degree specifically, with all of the professional benefits a degree confers. The specific research questions of the project are as follows: 1. What role do high school counselors, college counselors/recruiters, and faculty play in Black students? choice of ET versus engineering? 2. What are the academic and structural barriers that effect Black students? admittance to engineering? 3. What are the structural barriers and affordances that enable or prevent Black students to transfer from ET to engineering (and vice versa) from during an undergraduate program? 4. How do Black ET students perceive their future career opportunities? 5. To what extent do Black ET students identify with the Engineering and/or ET domain and how is this related to contextual salience of stereotype threat and belongingness to the program? 6. How do students? perceptions of their experiences in ET and the interpretation of these experiences relate to their self-schemas including their expectations of success, personal, cultural, and professional identities, and their career goals? This project will contribute to efforts to develop a more diverse STEM workforce by examining how these complexities influence student choice of major and suggesting solutions to lessen their impacts.<br/><br/>This collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EDU Racial Equity). The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce.

O4 promises to bring the largest network of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors and the best detector sensitivity seen to date. This award supports the Kenyon College LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) group, consisting of  PI L. Wade and co-PI M. Wade, and between four and six undergraduate research students, in their research pursuits in the field of gravitational-wave physics. The Kenyon College LSC group will contribute to the operation of the LIGO calibration pipeline and implementation of a novel LIGO calibration monitor, the construction of new machine learning algorithms for predicting the presence of noise artifacts in gravitational-wave strain data using information from detector auxiliary channels, and the development of more robust and sophisticated ways of measuring the neutron-star equation of state.  This award also supports two established, impactful astronomy and physics research groups that engage a diverse population of high school and undergraduate students: The Kenyon College Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group and the Mount Vernon High School (MVHS) astronomy club.  ROAR is a no-barrier to entry research group that targets recruitment at first- and second-year potential physics majors at Kenyon College.  Students in ROAR engage in discussions about current astronomy and gravitational physics research topics, do independent investigations into topics of interest, engage in hands-on astronomy and physics related activities, and contribute to outreach efforts in physics and astronomy.  The MVHS astronomy club is run out of the local high school near Kenyon College and regularly engages 10-20 high school students in hands-on activities and research topics in astronomy and gravitational physics.  <br/><br/>This award has three main research focusses: calibration, data quality, and neutron-star equation of state (EOS) parameter estimation.  This award will contribute to the operation of the LIGO calibration pipeline used to produce the final calibrated strain data, which is an effort lead by co-PI M. Wade, development and implementation of a monitoring tool for the low-latency calibrated data stream, and exploration of methods for producing a low-latency calibration systematic error estimate. The second focus area in this award is related to inferring the neutron star EOS from binary neutron star gravitational-wave events. PI L. Wade proposes to improve the flexibility of the parameterized models used to measure the neutron star EOS, develop inference software to marginalize over parameters measured in other contexts, and build software to allow the data to inform the number of parameters to use in the EOS models. Additionally, PI L. Wade will contribute to EOS inference efforts on any binary neutron star signals found in O4. The final set of research activities involve exploring improvements to the low-latency data quality identification system known as iDQ. iDQ uses machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to predict the presence of loud transient noise events, known as glitches, in the strain data using only auxiliary information. PI L. Wade and co-PI M. Wade propose to build hierarchical MLAs that will account for the variability in different auxiliary subsystems and the variability in glitch morphologies, aiming to improve the efficiency with which glitches can be identified in low-latency data, thereby improving the data quality information available to low-latency astrophysical analyses. The final research focus area will be in searching for a newly theorized signal known as a gravitational glint which is produced by perturbers along the line-of-sight from a compact binary event to an observer.  If no such signals are found in archival LIGO/Virgo data then upper bounds could be set on the density of perturbers in the universe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Synthesizing expertise in climate technology, communication, and multilingual education, the project will engage students in investigating, designing, and communicating critical engineering knowledge about community-based technological systems. Students will learn engineering as they construct and convey messages about climate technology in their community for an audience of family members, community groups, and civic leaders. While many existing middle-school engineering curricula emphasize creating an optimal solution to an engineering design problem for a client or user, this project takes a civic-oriented approach, where students engage in engineering to inform multilingual audiences about a climate technology affecting their local communities. An important characteristic of the urban school district partnering on this project is that students speak more than 50 languages and nearly 50% speak a language at home that differs from that of the dominant society. Given this, professional development workshops will support teacher learning to enact the curriculum so that it engages multilingual youth's participation in engineering design practices in culturally meaningful ways.<br/><br/>Over the course of three design-based research cycles with the proposed curriculum unit, the team will generate evidence-based theory about how a critical technology journalism approach influences engineering learning among sixth-grade youth, including students from multilingual families. The project aims to answer three research questions: (1) What is the evolution of student learning outcomes, including their practices of engineering, communication, and translanguaging, their ideas about climate tech, and their perceptions of the value of engineering and technical communication for the community?; (2) What community resources (language and culture, contexts) do students draw on as they participate in the curriculum?; and (3) What is the influence of curriculum resources and teacher facilitation moves on student learning outcomes? To answer these questions, the research team will use qualitative methods that include video recordings of lesson enactments and interviewing teachers and students. The team will analyze these data using techniques from interaction analysis and discourse analysis. Beyond the seven teachers and 920 students directly engaging in the curriculum during the four-year project, the project's Community Tech Press website will share the finalized curriculum unit and its supporting materials with the broader community. This dissemination intends to enable teachers across the country to adapt this approach to create locally-relevant curriculum for their multilingual students. This project is funded by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) that seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools.

Therefore, this project will examine the organizational socialization of newcomer civil engineers and will focus specifically on how the socialization process is gendered in ways that contribute to attrition from the profession. It will build on a previous longitudinal study on the same topic and will continue the long-term work of developing processes of acculturation to the engineering profession that are compatible with intersecting non-normative identities by refining and expanding an empirically-supported and engineering-specific model of gendered socialization. The integrated education and research plan will yield a dramatic impact on the field of engineering education by prioritizing the importance of underutilized gender theories, enrolling men in gender research and systems change, and addressing the gap in research on engineering workplaces. Other than the original study that this project builds on, no existing research has systematically examined the gendered organizational socialization experiences of newcomer men and women engineers. Ultimately, this project will facilitate greater equity in the socialization of newcomer engineers in order to decrease attrition from engineering careers and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. Furthermore, this project will contribute simultaneously to the fields of engineering education, engineering studies, organizational studies, and gender studies, among others.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project will be to refine and expand a theoretical model of gendered socialization in civil engineering workplaces and to create research-based interventions for more inclusive socialization. The study will involve two groups of participants. Group 1 will be early career civil engineers from around the country who have been participating in a similar study since 2018. They work in engineering firms, as well as in governmental organizations at the federal, state, and county levels. When the project begins, they will be in the fifth and sixth years of their careers. For this group, mixed-methods data will be collected longitudinally for three years through bi-monthly Individual Socialization Logs (an instrument developed during the course of the previous project) and twice-yearly in-depth interviews. The survey and interviews will explore their experiences in the workplace, including their biggest challenges, the most important things they are learning, their most memorable interactions, and their relationships with co-workers. Findings will be used to refine and expand the model that was created based on the first few years of their careers. Group 2 will be former early career civil engineers who left the engineering profession for a non-engineering career. They will participate in a one-time interview that will explore the reasons they left engineering, thought processes and timelines leading to that decision, what they think about their decisions now, workplace experiences that could have made a difference, and ways university could have better prepared them. From this data, a typology of the reasons for leaving and organizational socialization factors that played a role will be created. That typology will then be compared to the existing theoretical model and survey instrument to determine what additions need to be made to both in light of the experiences of those who have left civil engineering. Project outcomes will include identification and characterization of facets of organizational socialization (e.g., practices, processes, relationships and social networks) that are gendered, including how they are gendered intersectionally. Research findings and the model based on them will be utilized to create professional formation materials for civil engineering professionals. The professional formation materials will be implemented nationally and locally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graphs can model complex networked systems, and as such graph-based machine learning systems aiming at inferences from structured data, have gained significant traction. Data-driven systems, on the other hand, must deal with noisy, uncertain, and outlying measurements, as well as data provided by untrustworthy or even malicious sources. In addition, graph-aware systems must cope with errors in the estimated graph structure. Aspiring to address these challenges, this project introduces a comprehensive framework for robust learning over graphs that can identify and mitigate outliers, adversarial attacks, and errors in the graph structure. The development of scalable, robust, and trustworthy learning can enable active and timely inference and decision-making in domains such as social analytics, crowdsourcing, health informatics, and Internet-of-Things security.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to fortify learning over graphs against noise, anomalies, errors in the data, and adversaries. This project consists of three intertwined thrusts: (T1) identifying anomalies in nodal processes over network graphs; (T2) Graph-aware deep learning under perturbed graph structure, and; (T3) information and decision fusion to quantify the reliability of information sources. T1 leverages random sampling and consensus, as well as graph signal processing tools to pinpoint outlying nodes. Dealing with noisy or perturbed graph topologies, T2 endows graph convolutional networks with dithering-inspired modules that are robust to changes in graph links.

These are abstract algebraic structures  consisting of objects that can be fused using certain natural rules. Such categories are indispensable in the study of classical and quantum symmetries.  They are also used as mathematical models for a potential hardware design of a quantum computer. Namely, they correspond to topological phases of matter relevant to quantum computation and are used to predict the existence of new types of such phases, their behavior, and their physical realization. This project is motivated by these connections and deals with algebraic aspects of the theory of (higher) tensor categories: their structure, classification, and arithmetic properties. The emphasis is on categories that are most widely used in applications. Such categories admit an additional symmetry constraint called braiding that is used to model the interaction of quantum particles. Student recruitment and training are essential components of the proposed research activity.<br/><br/>This project will address fundamental questions concerning the structure and classification of braided tensor categories and 2-categories. Categorical techniques will be employed to interpret and solve algebraic problems. Previously developed tools such as categorical Witt and Picard groups will be generalized and combined into higher-categorical groups, providing a useful homotopy-theoretic machinery. The concrete research problems include the following: (1) classification of braided fusion 2-categories and description of their Witt invariants, (2) computation of groups of minimal extensions corresponding to symmetry-protected topological phases of matter, (3) study of Hecke algebras associated with fusion categories and their integral forms, (4) classification of  fiber functors on non-degenerate braided fusion categories using a categorical analog of Belavin-Drinfeld triples, and (5) classification of non-semisimple pointed braided tensor categories.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology addresses the need for physicians and dieticians to accurately map a patient?s metabolic rate, which may provide information to assist in guiding proper nutrition and significantly reduce costs in seriously ill patients. In addition, professional athletes and others in the fitness industry may utilize such a technology to further develop and track their performance, providing crucial information to their coaches and sports medicine personnel.  Current standard technologies, such as the metabolic cart, are large, cost-prohibitive (>$50K), and require intensive training and personnel for operation. As an inexpensive alternative, clinicians rely on crude calculations and daily weight measurements to guide patient nutrition. These predictive equations are often not accurate and are non-inclusive, only applying to a subset of the population. Dietitians struggle with making estimates for a variety of patients, especially for premature infants and patients that are obese, undergoing liver transplant surgeries, or suffering from thyroid problems. Accurate metabolic information from the proposed device may significantly increase quality of care, reduce readmission rates, length of stay, and complications, and contribute to reduced costs and positive healthcare outcomes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an optical sensor that evaluates peculiar gas analyte concentrations in the bloodstream to quantify the end-user?s metabolic rate. The goal is to implement the metabolism sensor as a wearable device to measure calorie output from a patient?s extremity (finger or ear).  The metabolic rate sensor utilizes a transdermal or transcutaneous, non-invasive optical sensor that measures carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) levels in the blood. The ratio of incident light to collected light through tissue will provide the data needed to calculate the patient?s energy expenditure. As caloric fuel is burned in the body in the presence of O2, CO2 is produced before being exhaled. The sensor system employs low-cost light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodiodes to measure the absorption and scattering of light at wavelengths specific to spectral markers of O2 and CO2. A proprietary algorithm adopted from the Weir equation estimates the number of calories burned in real time from continuous spectral measurement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations, widely used by physicists and engineers for real-life applications, were introduced almost two centuries ago. However, some essential questions, such as the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, are still not answered. Therefore, a notion of weak solutions, whose existence is known, has been extensively used by mathematicians. The project will demonstrate a limitation of this notion by constructing weak solutions with various unphysical properties. On the other hand, the project proposes to prove the existence of physical solutions that are expected to describe turbulent flows. This project will also provide opportunities for the involvement of graduate students in the project. <br/><br/>In the past couple of decades, mathematical fluid dynamics has been highlighted by numerous constructions of solutions to fluid equations that exhibit pathological or wild behavior, such as loss of the energy balance, non-uniqueness, singularity formation, and dissipation anomaly. Interesting from the mathematical point of view, these solutions provide counterexamples to various well-posedness results in supercritical spaces. Moreover, these constructive approaches are becoming more and more relevant from the physical point of view as well. Indeed, a fundamental physical property of turbulent flows is the existence of the energy cascade. Conjectured by Kolmogorov, the energy cascade has been observed both experimentally and numerically but had been difficult to produce analytically. The purpose of this project is to use state-of-the-art methods, such as convex integration and new developments in efficient mixing, to construct not only mathematically pathological, but also physically realistic solutions of fluid equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the increasing digitization of ICSs, involving sensing, communication, and control, brings advanced features but also exposes vulnerabilities to malicious cyber-attacks. Protecting ICSs from such attacks is crucial due to the potential catastrophic physical damages they can cause. The project aims to develop a comprehensive solution, integrating human-on-the-loop explainable machine learning (ML), detection, and recovery control in an operator-automation shared protection framework, to provide security and safety-assured ICSs against malicious cyber-attacks. Moreover, the project will incorporate engineering research and education to train students and cultivate a globally competitive cybersecurity workforce. With the goal of lowering barriers to ICSs security research and education, this project aims to have a significant impact by providing accessible testbeds for a broad population of beginning and expert cybersecurity students and engineers to learn and practice.<br/><br/>The underlying concept of process anomaly detection, which is used for detecting cyber-attacks, involves comparing observed and expected behaviors based on physical invariants. The data-driven approach has the advantage of automatically discovering these physical invariants without requiring domain expertise. However, existing approaches based on black-box Machine Learning (ML) often overlook the role of system operators in safety-critical ICSs. The lack of insightful explanations in detection results hinders system operators from conducting troubleshooting and isolating anomalous sensors and actuators under attack, which is necessary for scheduling online recovery. To address this issue, the PI's team proposes to develop an operator-automation shared protection framework that unifies human-on-the-loop explainable ML, detection, and recovery control. This framework aims to enable real-time decision-making using cutting-edge ML and control techniques while valuing the feedback of human operators to prevent over-trust in autonomy in a safety-critical system. The research project has three major objectives: 1) The PI's team will develop insightful hybrid automata learning that captures physical invariants in a way that system operators can understand the model and the detection results, verify and correct the model, and localize anomalies; 2) A real-time provably safe control under uncertainty will be designed to restore the system to normal operation without violating safety constraints; and 3) the PI?s team will evaluate, demonstrate, and disseminate best practices of the proposed framework on 3D simulated and real testbeds with portability across a wide range of ICSs for lowering the barriers to ICSs security research and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More information is needed to put recent climate changes into a long-term context of natural climate variability. This information helps to foresee possible future climate trends, especially those that involve slow-moving features of the climate system, which will continue to change over hundreds to thousands of years to come. A variety of geological evidence can be used to extend observations of temperature and other climate variables back in time. This project focuses on reconstructing glacier fluctuations in Alaska, the Arctic region of the United States, as evidence for past climate changes extending back for thousands of years. The research team will estimate past glacier size by studying sediment from glaciers that is carried by meltwater streams and deposited in glacier-fed lakes. The sediment samples collected for this project will also be studied for signs of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to determine how frequently these damaging events have occurred in the past and will likely occur in the future. The project will also help prepare undergraduate and graduate students for careers in the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The extent of glacier cover is a prime indicator of climate. Sediments stored in glacier-fed (proglacial) lakes provide a uniquely continuous record of glacier-size fluctuations. This project will further develop the ability to reconstruct the extent of glacier cover within the catchment of proglacial lakes using basic sedimentary indicators of glacier rock-flour abundance (bulk density, organic matter, particle size, magnetic susceptibility, and accumulation rate). By sampling proglacial lakes along an environmental gradient of heavily to sparsely glaciated catchments in Alaska, the research team will systematically acquire quantitative information about these well-known glacial indicators, which vary with glacier size and other environmental variables. This information will be used to develop a numerical model to estimate past glacier extent based on lake sediment properties measured in sediment cores taken from multiple lakes in south-central and northwest Alaska that extend back to around 15,000 years. In addition to rock-flour indicators, the sediment will be analyzed for terrestrial and aquatic productivity indicators, including organic pigments and biogenic silica abundance, which are amenable to generating time series with decadal-scale resolution. These records will be used to address fundamental questions related to the timing and extent of climate changes in Alaska that occurred following the last major ice age. The ages of the lake sediment will be determined using short-lived radioisotopes, volcanic ash layers, and radiocarbon dating. This project will also contribute to assessing geological hazards related to seismic and volcanic activity near the most populated area of Alaska, supporting and engaging STEM graduate and undergraduate students and early career researchers, and developing scientific resources, including the popular Alaska PaleoGlacier Atlas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cort Anastasio, Ted Hullar, and Davide Donadio from the University of California at Davis and their teams will study the influence of surfaces and organic molecules on nitrate photochemistry. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are emitted during combustion of fossil fuels, play major roles in the production of smog.  During smog formation, NOx is converted to nitrate, which traditionally was thought to be an unreactive final product.  However, research over the past 20 years suggests that some nitrate in the environment ? such as on surfaces or in the presence of certain carbon-containing molecules ? can absorb sunlight to very quickly reform NOx.  If true, this would lead to more smog than expected from the initial NOx emissions. The collaborative UC-Davis team will address this discrepancy in the projected studies. This project also includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students as well as contributions to podcasts and fact sheets about environmental chemistry for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>This project will study nitrate photochemistry on surfaces and in the presence of organic molecules by combining computational chemical modeling with experimental measurements in the laboratory. The modeling will leverage ab initio molecular dynamics of the (photo)excited triplet state to unravel the molecular pathways and free energy surface of nitrate photochemistry in solution.  This will allow predictions of nitrate quantum yields, which will be benchmarked against published measurements.  This approach will then be applied to predict quantum yields on a variety of environmentally relevant surfaces, which will be integrated with computed nitrate absorption spectra to estimate nitrate photolysis rates.  Simultaneously, rates of nitrate photolysis on the same surfaces will be measured in the laboratory using newly developed techniques to study solid-state photochemistry with monochromatic illumination.  Unlike most past studies, the measurements will also employ chemical actinometry on the surface to better quantify photon fluxes. Then by combining the modeling and experimental results, the team aims to establish the extent to which faster nitrate photolysis on surfaces is due to an increase in light absorption and/or an increase in photochemical efficiency.  Using computational and experimental approaches, this project will also assess how organic molecules impact nitrate photolysis in solution and explore the underlying mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Paul Wennberg, Brian Stoltz, and John Crounse at the California Institute of Technology will study atmospheric reactions of volatile chemical products (VCPs). VCPs are oxygen-containing hydrocarbons (such as glycol ethers and esters) that are common solvents used in a array of products, including paints, cleaning agents and liquid soaps, herbicides, hydraulic fracturing fluids, and dyes for fabrics. When they are used, large quantities of these compounds vaporize and become a major, if not the dominant, contributor to the photochemistry producing ozone and small particles (aerosols) that contribute to poor air quality in many cities. The importance of VCPs is also growing because of decreasing vehicle emissions. Accurate knowledge of how much ozone and aerosols are produced is important to understand air quality. Ozone is broadly toxic to plants and animals, including humans because it causes inflammation of the lungs and bronchia. Aerosols make the air hazy, reduce visibility and are associated with respiratory and other illnesses. Through a collaboration with the University of Copenhagen and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), modeling studies will be carried on the oxidative chemistry of VCPs to learn how they contribute to the formation of ozone and particles in air. In addition to training of students, the team will engage in outreach both at their campus and at local schools, addressing air quality as a topic of high interest to the community. <br/><br/>A major uncertainty in understanding the impacts of VCPs on air quality is whether their oxidation results in formation of low volatility compounds. In particular, radical autoxidation may be active in their degradation. Autoxidation via H-shift reactions of organic peroxy radicals can rapidly produce highly oxygenated organic compounds from much more volatile precursors. These highly oxygenated compounds have a much lower vapor pressure and condense to form aerosol. This laboratory and computational investigation will examine the hypothesis that the ether moiety, common in many oxygenated VCPs, enhances the rate of these H-shifts making autoxidation an essential part of accurately describing their atmospheric degradation and thus their impact on air pollution. In this project, the investigators will study the rates of these oxidative reactions for a diverse set of organic substrates that include those that dominate the emissions of oxygenated VCPs to the atmosphere.  There are potentially important long range scientific implications of this work for the understanding of the genesis of oxidized organics in the atmosphere, while at the same time mapping out mechanism and product distribution for a wide spectrum of relevant volatile organic compounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These rulesets are often inspired by practical phenomena, and distill fundamental mathematical structures from graph theory, logic, topology, etc. As a result, research on them is highly interdisciplinary. Mathematical board games require deep strategic reasoning (about long alternation down to the last level of their game trees), making them more challenging in general than traditional decision/optimization problems. Thus, mathematical board games are also deeply connected with a wide range of computational complexity classes. This research project will develop theory and algorithms for a new subarea of mathematical board games where quantum-inspired principles based on superposition and entanglement are incorporated into game rulesets. The quantum-inspired transformation introduces intriguing strategic options and hence impacts the outcome and complexity of these games. This research project also involves the mentorship of PhD students. The recreational nature of mathematical games in this project will also help engage students of all levels (including K-12) to broaden their participation in mathematical and computational thinking.<br/><br/>The specific goals of this project are to characterize the impact of quantum-inspired rules on a broad family of combinatorial games. At a high level, the quantum-inspired transformation can be viewed as an operator on mathematical games, introducing superpositions of ?classical moves.? Mathematically, it expands the strategic-decision space by creating a superposition of ?entangled classical game positions,? introducing ?nondeterminism? into traditional games. Philosophically, the new framework models real-world online decision phenomena in which multiple future scenarios might still be achievable. However, the decision in each step may expand possibilities while eliminating others. In other words, the consequence of each decision is multifaceted. The impact of this operator to the complexity of the games is highly nonmonotonic, which provides a rich subject for complexity-theoretical characterization. In addition, another goal of this research is to explore other forms of nondeterminism in mathematical games and expand a matching-theory-based algorithmic technique to these deep-logic strategic decision problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers from heterogenous geographic locations, institutions, career stages, and demographic groups will get access to the project?s infrastructure and data. Investigators will be able to use SHIPS to identify variations in outcomes due to state institutions, history, and policies, as well as employing cutting-edge social science methods to identify causes of public beliefs. The scale of the project will allow researchers to examine public opinion not only across states, but also among specific subgroups that often evade study (e.g., people with low income or education). The project will engage students as part of the research team, as well as offering curriculum development and hands-on training. SHIPS will generate academic papers, public-facing reports, and make data trends easily digestible with interactive visualization and online dashboards.<br/><br/>The main goal of The State Health, Institutions, and Politics Survey is to provide high-quality state-level longitudinal data on public opinion, allowing researchers to track and document cross-country trends. The research team has developed and validated an approach that allows for the regular collection and post-stratification weighting of large census-balanced samples from every state and Washington, DC.  Large-scale survey waves with up to 25,000 respondents will be fielded at regular time intervals. The sample size will enable exploring heterogeneous effects and examining outcomes for small, difficult to study population subgroups. The project will also be flexible and reactive to sudden events that could prompt the need for immediate data collection. SHIPS will give scholars access to survey modules and results via a competitive application process. Half or more of the survey content fielded in each wave funded by this grant will be designed by applicants whose peer-reviewed proposals have been accepted.

While some eruptions are explosive, others erupt without major explosive behavior, leading to different natural hazards for each eruptive style. These distinct eruption styles are controlled by the fundamental physical properties of magma, particularly viscosity, and density. The viscosity of magma is highly dependent on the atomic-scale structure of the magma, influenced by magma composition, temperature, pressure, and the presence of dissolved gasses such as water vapor. In this study, the researchers aim to obtain fundamental physical constraints on the structure and viscosity of magma at conditions relevant to the Earth?s interior. We will combine the experimentally derived physical properties of magma and fluids with numerical simulations to predict how magmas migrate from the Earth?s subducting plates. It is the migration of this material that ultimately leads to eruptions at the surface, but the complex role of viscosity in magma transport makes it difficult to trace material from its source in the interior to the surface. The project will  provide training for the next generation of Earth Scientists at various stages of their career, including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral scholars.  <br/><br/>Although extensive research has been done to constrain the elastic and transport properties of fluids and melts at conditions relevant to the Earth?s interior, the combined effects of pressure, temperature, and dissolved water remain poorly constrained at the conditions of the upper mantle where these melts are produced. This research will couple lab- and synchrotron-based experimental data to pressures up to 20 GPa with first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations, with the objective to determine the local melt structure, and fluid and melt viscosity to high pressures and temperatures. This work will quantify the structure and properties of aqueous fluids with dissolved albite, in addition to albite and basaltic melts with and without water. The results will provide insight into how pressure, temperature, and composition affect the structure and viscosity of polymerized aluminosilicate melts at mid-mantle depths and illuminate the causes of observed pressure anomalies on viscosity. The resulting viscosities will be integrated into two-phase flow models in the slab-arc system and the upwelling region above the mantle transition zone to assess the pathways of melt migrations through state-of-the-art geodynamical models. These models will assess how the pattern of fluid migration changes with slab age and subduction rate, slab thermal structure, and the distribution and volume of fluid sources in the subducting slab. The resulting work will assess the impact of fluid volumes due to melting and whether melting alone is sufficient to focus melts into a narrow region beneath volcanic regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal is to provide a tool to support biomedical research, pre-clinical drug development, and predict cancer patients? prognosis and treatment outcomes.  It is envisioned that this platform may be used for the development of tests to identify early on which cancer treatments will be effective for certain patients, and provide immediate guidance for clinicians to make optimal decisions before disease conditions worsen or metastasize.

The proposed technology overcomes the fundamental resolution limits of conventional optical microscopes by utilizing tissue expansion, a process whereby the tissue is chemically embedded into a water-swellable hydrogel and physically expanded. This allows for a more detailed view of the nanoscopic details of tissue using a traditional fluorescent microscope commonly accessible in clinical research labs. The proposed process is designed to expand biological specimens up to 11-fold and facilitates imaging with effectively ~25 nm resolution using conventional optical microscopes or with ~15 nm effective resolution when combined with Super Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging. The proposed platform can extract actionable information from pathology specimens by combining deep learning. Such information is otherwise unavailable using existing pathological imaging techniques, such as bright field and florescent imaging. In addition, the proposed platform may be compatible with commercial multiplexing imaging platforms and may offer a powerful assay to reveal the complex spatial omics maps and signaling pathways of healthy and diseased tissues, which is essential for pre-clinical development.

The Fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Amino acids are one of the essential building blocks of life.  All cells use amino acids to create larger, more complex structures called proteins, with several requiring additional changes to ensure proper function.  In some proteins, one such change involves the attachment of complex sugar molecules to specific amino acids; this process is called glycosylation.  Once attached, these sugars play roles in controlling how proteins function and how proteins interact with other molecules.  Without glycosylation, proteins would function improperly, disrupting essential biological functions.  In humans, this can lead to numerous congenital disorders and cancers.  Despite its critical role, little is understood about how the complex sugars used in glycosylation are generated.  Thus, this research seeks to investigate the enzymes that make these sugars; this work explores enzyme function by understanding their molecular structures.  Because glycosylation is important for all life, understanding these enzymes will create new insights that guide future applications in biotechnology, including designing new therapeutics that target congenital disorders of glycosylation and cancers.  Moreover, this work will facilitate the fellow?s ability to directly train and mentor diverse trainees navigating their own scientific careers. <br/><br/>This work will enrich foundational knowledge of asparagine-linked glycosylation (NLG) by defining broad catalytic mechanisms of phosphotransferases and glycosyltransferases, and formulating underlying principles applicable to NLG in all domains of life.  Using recombinant protein expression in human cells, structural biology, bioinformatics, and biochemistry, this work will fully characterize the human phosphotransferase, DPATG1, and its partner glycosyltransferases Alg13 and Alg14.  This work will also investigate novel interactions between other essential NLG glycosyltransferases.  To achieve this, the fellow will determine the structure of human DPAGT1 in complex with novel inhibitors by cryo-EM.  Then, the fellow will structurally characterize the DPAGT1/Alg13/Alg14 complex.  Lastly, the fellow will leverage AlphaFold to probe uncharacterized heterooligomeric complexes and define universal mechanisms of integral membrane phosphotransferases and glycosyltransferases from the NLG pathway.

We know that mosquitos locate and bite humans by their sensitive sense of smell.  However, mosquitoes do not bite everyone equally ? some people are bitten more than others. What causes this difference in the mosquito?s biting preference? Remarkably, mosquitoes can learn and remember based on past experiences, particularly the experience of having an animal or person swat at them. The experience of being the target of a swat can modify their odor and biting preferences, but we know remarkably little about how this information is processed in the mosquito brain. This project will use an interdisciplinary approach that combines novel behavioral and electrophysiological techniques from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to understand how odor learning takes place to modify their biting behaviors. These projects will also incorporate training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates with the aim of preparing them for independent scientific careers. High School students in the Upward Bound Program will also participate in the project through summer seminars and lab experiences. <br/><br/>In this project, we build on our recent findings that dopamine-mediated learning and modulation in the mosquito?s primary olfactory system, the antennal lobe, is critical for Aedes aegypti mosquito host preferences. Using an interdisciplinary approach, our collaborative team will elucidate the role of dopamine-mediated plasticity in olfactory circuits. We accomplish this with three Objectives: (1) We will test the hypothesis that mosquitoes only learn certain odors, corresponding to the tuning of specific antennal lobe glomeruli. (2) To test that ?learnable? odors are encoded by antennal lobe glomeruli that receive dense dopaminergic innervation. And (3) to test the hypothesis that coincident dopamine and odor input cause plasticity of antennal lobe project neurons and allows mosquitoes to learn important olfactory stimuli. We suggest that our proposed experiments may provide a basic framework for understanding the contribution of dopaminergic plasticity in early olfactory circuits. Moreover, olfactory behaviors, including learning, are critical for mosquito preferences and biting of human hosts, and thereby spread diseases that afflict nearly a billion people annually. Therefore, unraveling the neural bases of learning in mosquitoes has important potential for developing new strategies for their control. The project will also introduce students to interdisciplinary research and broadly communicate insect neurobiology's importance to high school students.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Alyssa Kearly is ?Machine learning and high-throughput reverse genetic approaches for the identification and functional characterization of peptides encoded in the short ORFs of lncRNAs.? The host institution for the fellowship is the Boyce Thompson Institute and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Andrew Nelson and Aleksandra Skirycz.<br/><br/>Plants produce a variety of small peptides that serve as communication signals and regulators of critical processes, including plant growth, development, and responses to environmental change. As naturally derived compounds, they represent attractive candidates for the development of safer pesticides, food preservatives, and medicines. Therefore, efforts to comprehensively identify and functionally characterize small peptides could have tremendous impacts not only on the general understanding of plant biology, but also on agriculture and medicine. The improved resources and computational tools for small peptide prediction to be developed through this project will be invaluable to a more complete exploration of these biologically significant peptides. Additionally, the proposed endeavors to generate functional predictions will provide insight into their roles and potential for cross-application. This work will provide training in machine learning, transcriptomics, proteomics, and comparative functional genomics. Throughout the project, the Fellow will engage in undergraduate mentorship opportunities that broaden access to scientific research and workshops that will increase her effectiveness as an educator.<br/><br/>Small peptides play critical roles as regulatory and signaling molecules in plant development and stress responses. Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined by their low protein-coding potential, a subset containing small open reading frames (sORFs) have recently been shown to undergo active translation, introducing lncRNAs as an unexplored source of small peptides. The identification of functional sORFs and detection of their encoded peptides (SEPs) has historically been hindered by biased prediction methods and limitations of experimental techniques. This has led to the persistent misclassification of an unknown number of sORF-containing lncRNAs and the overlooking of the potentially bioactive SEPs encoded therein. This project aims to develop improved computational tools for the prediction of functional sORFs and to make strides in functionally characterizing their peptide products. Through the reanalysis of published ribosomal profiling datasets, the Fellow will build a database of translated lncRNA sORFs across model and crop plant species, to be made accessible to the broader scientific community via TAIR (arabidopsis.org). This database will be used to develop a functional sORF prediction algorithm trained on experimentally validated translated sORFs and unbiased by unvalidated gene annotations. Through the use of high-throughput phenotyping of SEP mutants and proteomic screens to identify interacting proteins, the Fellow will make functional predictions for candidate SEPs and assess their conservation. The results of this project will contribute to the fundamental understanding of plant functional genomics and provide resources for future sORF and SEP research, while offering insight into the biological function of as-of-yet uncharacterized lncRNAs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This can lead to patient non-compliance and/or delays in treatment of OSA. The goal is to create a device that is more comfortable, effective, and non-invasive and provides additional treatment options for patients with OSA.  The proposed generated devices may then be worn by patients to treat OSA through nightly wear, which may reduce the societal impacts of sleep apnea and healthcare costs.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of point-of-care manufacturing of devices to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The study will be carried out at two sites in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho, where existing hydrometeorological information will supplement new geophysical imaging methods. Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography will be used to monitor the daily or weekly resistivity variations related to subsurface water storage changes. A newly developed resistivity inversion scheme incorporating critical zone subsurface structure will be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal resistivity distribution along a transect at each study site. The site-specific petrophysical relationship between resistivity and water content will also be determined such that the subsurface water dynamics can be estimated from resistivity data.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Animals have many strategies for overcoming challenges in nature. When different animals share a similar solution to a problem, this is known as convergent evolution. For nutritional challenges, many animals team up with microbes, such as bacteria and fungi. The microbes can supplement the animal?s diet with essential nutrients or help digest tough foods. This research will investigate if the same microbes will be present across a group of convergently-evolved ants, the honeypot ants. There are at least sixteen types of honeypot ants across the world that share a strategy for living in desert-like environments. All honeypot ant colonies have a specialized class of workers, called repletes. Repletes store food in their abdomen, sometimes swelling up to the size of a marble with all the food they store. Due to this division of labor, the repletes can provide food for the entire ant colony during the dry season, when food is in short supply. This work will characterize the composition (who is there?) and function (what are they doing?) of the microbiomes of different honeypot ants. This will result in a deeper understanding of the impacts of evolution and division of labor on microbial communities, and vice versa. Since all animals associate with microbes in some way, these results could be applied beyond ants.

The goal is to use social network analysis with qualitative methods to characterize the professional support networks of women and GSM physicists to test the central hypothesis: professional support networks of these physicists will include substantial out-of-field or out-of-hierarchy elements and that significant differences may appear by employment sector.  The specific aims are to (1) identify the types of professional support networks experienced by GSM physicists, (2) compare professional support networks and career trajectories between different GSM identities, (3) compare professional support network characteristics among physics employment sectors, and (4) synthesize results into a professional support network survey that can be distributed to a wider scientist audience.  The project will provide a nuanced understanding of these changing roles and structures with the goal of broadening participation in physics for underrepresented or marginalized groups.  <br/><br/>The project will employ standpoint theory to investigate research questions that are aligned with the project aims. The framework motivates the importance of in-depth data collection that centers an individual with their multitude of experiences. It also suggests that individuals from underserved groups should not be compared to those from majority groups, but investigators should focus knowledge production from their voices and lives. Investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews to address three research questions: (1) How are the professional support networks of women and GSM in physics characterized? (2) How satisfied are women and GSM in physics with their career trajectories and current jobs? What network patterns are associated with higher satisfaction and sense of professional identity? (3) What similarities and differences exist among employment sectors?  Investigators will use qualitative methods to analyze and code participant surveys and ego network analysis to focus the exploration of the professional networks of women and GSM physicists. The project contributes guidance for universities, professional societies, and mentors to better understand the professional network needs of women and GSM scientists.  <br/><br/>The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program that supports fundamental research focused on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM professional workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These field oscillations are challenging to measure in time due to how quickly they fluctuate (e.g. visible light fields oscillate hundreds of trillions of times per second).  In this work we will develop nanometer-scale antennas (one nanometer is one billionth of one meter) capable of capturing the fields of light inside optical waveguides, small glass channels for transporting light on a chip, as they oscillate in time.  These waveguide-integrated antennas will be capable of measuring electric fields with a time resolution of less than one femtosecond (one millionth of one billionth of one second).  Our work will provide researchers and engineers with full access to the information stored within the fields of light.  This access could enable new technologies for enhanced optical sensing, or new forms of optical frequency electronics for high-speed computing and communications.  Beyond the technical efforts of this program, we will pursue outreach and education efforts that span from local to global.  We will develop interactive course materials based around executable textbook platforms that will be openly available to the public.  We will actively contribute our expertise to public knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia.  We will use publicly available services to host free and open copies of our manuscripts, data, and code before publication in academic journals. Finally, we will work with K-12 schools in rural Appalachia, where the PI is from, to deliver a series of hands-on workshops and seminars.  These workshops and seminars will connect students there with our research, as well as science, technology and mathematics education more broadly. We will target school districts with some of the lowest college completion rates in the country (as low as 5% in some counties).  Our efforts will help cultivate a more inclusive and vibrant research community for future generations.  <br/><br/>Chip-integrated frequency comb sources are developing rapidly.  To leverage the reduction in size, cost, and complexity that these sources offer, compact, scalable, and ultrafast field-sensitive optical detectors are needed. We will develop waveguide-integrated petahertz-electronic devices that will enable all-on-chip few-cycle waveform control and field-resolved metrology.  First, we will design, fabricate, and test waveguide-integrated nanoantenna-based detectors for the detection and stabilization of carrier-envelope phase (CEP).   These detectors will deliver CEP-sensitive signal to noise ratios on the order of tens of dB at tens to hundreds of kilohertz resolution bandwidths, and we will demonstrate their ability to stabilize few-cycle frequency combs.  Unlike f-2f techniques, the methods explored here will circumvent the need for nonlinear conversion and will be coupled to standard waveguide materials such as silicon nitride just tens of microns in length.  Second, we will develop waveguide-integrated nanoantenna detectors for field-resolved sampling of arbitrary optical waveform.  We will use these field-sampling devices to demonstrate label-free molecular detection, and to sample nonlinear light-matter interaction dynamics.   We will study how to leverage optimized device designs, signal readout multiplexing, waveguide coupling, and excitation methods to achieve few- to single-shot waveform and CEP detection.  Applications will be far-reaching.  The devices developed in this program  will enable studies of linear and nonlinear light-matter interaction dynamics in complex media, such as exciton dynamics important to solar energy conversion or electron dynamics that result in extreme nonlinearities.  Applications include label-free molecular detection, and the stabilization of on-chip frequency combs for atomic clocks or ranging instruments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NSJV is uniquely positioned to lead in bioindustrial manufacturing due to an unparalleled combination of large-scale food and agricultural activity, manufacturing capacity, and proximity to hubs of biotechnology innovation. NSJV is a historically underserved region, with poverty and unemployment rates well above the state average, low relative educational attainment, and significant environmental justice and public health challenges. By building regional specialization in bioindustrial manufacturing, the NSJV can diversify and strengthen its regional economy by moving up the value chain, generate higher-quality and accessible family-sustaining jobs for local residents, advance the national bioeconomy and the transition to a net-zero carbon economy, and promote a more sustainable food and agriculture system that reduces environmental and public health harm to surrounding communities. <br/><br/>Biomanufacturing uses bioscience and biotechnology - especially the use of fermentation - to create useful products, including chemicals, materials, and fuels, from organic material. Yet there is a gap in translation of basic discoveries into bioproduction and bioengineering applications with public benefit, particularly translation into scalable solutions that meet the market demands and the scope of global sustainability challenges. There are gaps in areas of innovation related to feedstock diversification, advanced biomanufacturing process optimization, and equipment of the future for producing new bioproducts at scale. At the same time, there is a new opportunity for growing thousands of high-quality jobs that offer economic mobility - including for workers without a four-year degree - in a region where only one-third of current jobs provide pathways to prosperity. With intentional policies and coordination, bioindustrial manufacturing presents the opportunity to decrease racial disparities, address environmental injustice, and build wealth by integrating inclusion into this strategy through workforce development efforts.

The ?plastic?s revolution? of the mid-twentieth century has greatly added value to society but has also created highly durable plastics that are used to make objects of limited life-expectancy. There are limited cost-effective alternatives to many of these polymers. Every day, 8 million pieces of plastic are thrown into the ocean amounting to 10 million tons per year. Although there are approaches to decompose or depolymerize the polymers used in common plastic parts, these methods are not generally efficient across the dimensions of cost, energy use, time for degradation, or scalability. An extreme example of the need for energy and time efficient depolymerization of polymers is in space missions. There is a very high cost of disposing solids in earth?s orbit and removing space-junk which must be monitored and avoided by orbiting satellites. Even more challenging is the need for reusable materials during extended space missions due to the lack of raw materials.	<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a polymer-based plastics technology that allows for rapid, low-energy, triggerable disposal of plastics when a space mission has been completed. This project also proposes to carry out the disposal of plastics so that the products can extend their value and be recycled to make the same or different objects in space. Closing the polymer-carbon cycle has potential to extend space missions, lower the amount of supply materials needed, and reduce the amount of orbiting space junk. This project is developing a unique family of polymers which can be easily depolymerized back to the starting monomers via a photo or thermal trigger. The polymers are composed of cyclic, low ceiling temperature polymers. The low ceiling temperature means that once a single chemical bond in the polymer is broken, two ends are formed which instantaneously lead to depolymerization of the entire polymer molecule back to its original monomers.  The depolymerized monomers can be evaporated to make the plastic parts ?disappear? or can be captured and used to repolymerize a new plastic component. This project will develop specific depolymerization triggers and a continuous-flow polymerization reactor for synthesizing plastic parts in space (and elsewhere for on-earth applications).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Globally, agricultural systems must become more productive and resilient to feed an expected population of 10 billion by 2050. Those systems must also confront declining biodiversity, unsustainable resource use, labor inequality, and climate change. The agricultural sector in Wisconsin is a source of strength contributing $104.8 billion annually to Wisconsin's economy and 11.8% of the workforce. An innovation engine dedicated to sustainable agriculture across Wisconsin will address these global and regional challenges while nurturing healthy ecosystems and supporting sustainable land, water, and energy management. They must balance trade-offs between production yield, labor, water, energy, land, and climate. This Engine Development Award builds on a partnership between the innovation and technology management offices of the University of Wisconsin (UW) System - WiSys, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), and UW-Milwaukee Research Foundation (UWMRF). The award will leverage the WiSys VentureHome® network to provide Wisconsin's physical and digital infrastructure to accomplish these goals and facilitate collaboration among new and existing collaborators across academia, industry, government, nonprofits, and farms.<br/><br/>The technical plans combine the latest scientific advances enriched by traditional farmer knowledge with bold socio-economic initiatives that support innovative new ventures and develop a tech-savvy and diverse agriculture workforce. Farmlands across the Midwest need economically viable strategies to reduce the impact of climate change on agricultural production, mitigate agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, solve water quality problems, and enhance the production of underutilized specialty crops that improve consumer health. The subsequent NSF Engines development application attracted thirty-five Wisconsin partners who provided letters of collaboration, including thirteen collaborators who will pilot innovative programs through subcontracts. Together, the network will harness use-inspired research across UW System into novel and emerging technologies from animal and plant breeding and genetics to next-generation sensors and digital agriculture to support improved food-production systems based on principles of ecological intensification. Through the WiSys VentureHome network, they will address the regional gaps in the lack of accessible entrepreneurial support for high-tech, scalable startups, access to early-stage risk capital, and mentorship from experienced founders. Funds from this Development Award will serve as seed capital to supercharge existing university-industry-nonprofit collaborations, attract and train under-capitalized workers in non-metropolitan communities, and catalyze a new Regional Innovation Engine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In classical computing, information is encoded and processed in bits that can exist in one of two states, typically depicted as 0 or 1, and each bit acts independently.  Quantum bits (qubits) behave fundamentally different and can be placed in a superposition state, representing a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. This can potentially solve complex problems beyond our current computing capability. Additionally, quantum systems can be entangled, which links the behavior of two separate items. This can increase quantum computing capability and provide unbreakable encryption in quantum communication. QISE has the potential to revolutionize all information science areas, and leadership in this field represents a huge economic opportunity. The region of service for this Development Award includes the states of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, which contain one of only two NSF-funded Quantum Foundries nationally, multiple existing quantum research groups, and multiple companies that are part of the Quantum Supply Chain producing not only quantum materials but also other photonic, electronic, cryogenic and classical computing components required to stabilize, encode and decode, transmit or interface with quantum computers and information systems. <br/><br/>University-led use-inspired research will include investigating quantum devices by Boise State University's Quantum DNA group, new methods of designing and fabricating topological Josephson junction qubits by the University of Wyoming, two-dimensional quantum materials, and quantum networking by Montana State University.

It will seek to emulate and enhance the spirit of Claude Shannon?s celebrated and enormously consequential notion of mutual information which constitutes a measure of correlation between two random signals. The role of shared information will be investigated for operational meanings in network information theory with implications for related communication applications and as a self-contained, compact, and calculable figure-of-merit that can be optimized in learning applications where statistical correlation is of central interest. The goal is to establish central theoretical and practical roles for shared information in network data compression, distributed function computation, reliable and secure information transmission in networks, signal cluster detection, and a new category of statistical estimation and learning algorithms. Engineering applications include communication and signal processing in a smart home, satellite image reconstruction, and messaging protocols in automated guided vehicles and drone swarms.<br/><br/>The technical approach involves (i) establishing basic properties of shared information; (ii) examining its role in common randomness generation including algorithms for combinatorial tree packing and network function computation, especially signal acquisition or omniscience; (iii) querying common randomness; (iv) hypothesis testing for cluster and community detection; (v) multiuser data compression and channel transmission; and (vi) estimation of shared information when the underlying probability distribution of the signals is unknown. Rooted in information theory, the research has rich connections to algorithms in combinatorial graph theory (in Theoretical Computer Science) and correlated multiarmed bandits (in Learning). It aims to create advances in network information theory through new models and methods that highlight interactive communication among the terminals, with the concept of shared information serving as a linchpin. Links to important problems in combinatorial algorithms, by way of shared information, highlight interpretations that promise new understanding and solutions. Furthermore, the estimation of shared information using correlated multiarmed bandits will introduce models, concepts, and algorithms in an essential but fledgling realm of machine learning. The research will be accomplished using methods from information theory, Markov random fields, combinatorial graph theory, and statistical inference. Expected research outcomes include interactive techniques for multiuser data compression and channel transmission, algorithms for combinatorial tree packing, methods for detecting clusters of correlated signals, and bandit algorithms for parameter estimation in correlated signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mobility comes in all shapes and sizes, from the downstream march of the smallest sandbar to the wholesale diversion of river channels after a major flood. It remains unclear how these multiple scales of river mobility are responding to ongoing climate change and human activities (e.g., dams, deforestation), which are drastically disrupting the water and sediment supplied to rivers worldwide. This team of investigators will tackle this knowledge gap by surveying multiscale river mobility in the satellite archive?nearly a half-century of global imagery?using state-of-the-art image processing. The project will provide opportunities for interdisciplinary training to undergraduate students, one graduate student, and one postdoctoral researcher. It will also provide K-12 outreach to underrepresented groups in partnership with existing programs, and deliver a valuable public dataset to inform future studies and management along rivers in our changing world.<br/><br/>To survey multiscale river mobility, investigators will leverage two state-of-the-art image-processing techniques. First, the smaller-scale motion of individual banks and bars will be captured using particle image velocimetry. Second, the larger-scale motion of channel diversions, floodplain reworking, and other processes will be captured using reach-scale pixel-based methods. Then, investigators will couple river mobility results with global observations and models of sediment and water supply to test two specific hypotheses: 1) the pace of large-scale river mobility is set by the long-term supply of water and sediment; and 2) the pace of small-scale bank movements has changed in response to recent climate- and human-induced disruption in water and sediment supply, with some degree of natural variability that depends on river type (e.g., meandering, braided).

The work will focus on the effects of proton beams, detected by PSP/SPAN-I on the nonlinear evolution of the magnetosonic instability. The magnetic wave spectra and energy partition between the ions and the electromagnetic fields will be determined focusing on ion kinetic scales. The team will analyze the PSP/SPAN-I data of the proton and alpha particle velocity distribution functions (VDFs) with beams during perihelia encounters, as well as plasma moments such as density, anisotropic temperature, and alpha relative abundance data. The FIELDS instrument will provide the corresponding kinetic wave activity magnitude, spectra, and polarizations. Guided by the observations, the team will use 2.5D and 3D hybrid-particle-in-cell (hybrid-PIC) models of kinetic protons and alpha particles with background electron fluid in an expanding box model to study the kinetic instabilities driven by initially unstable non- Maxwellian VDFs such as super-Alfve?nic beams and ion relative drifts in the inner solar wind. The models will be used to calculate the physical properties and nonlinear evolution of the proton and alpha particle populations in the expanding solar wind, such as the ion drift speeds, anisotropic temperatures, magnetic energy and spectra, and the associated plasma heating processes. They will develop Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning (AI/ML) methods to automate the detection of unstable VDFs and classification of the kinetic instabilities using semi-supervised (i.e., labeled, and unlabeled data) and supervised (i.e., labeled data) ML methods such as multi-layered (i.e., deep) neural networks (DNNs).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is an important design consideration in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals where control of solubility is required for optimal drug delivery.  The lack of solubility control also can be a limiting factor in the formulation of food products and diet supplements. Past studies of the solubility of crystalline materials have focused on the effects of crystal lattice structure and liquid composition on solubility. These studies have largely ignored the role composition variations within individual crystals play in solubility, likely due to the difficulty of measuring these variations. This project will investigate whether compositional variations within a crystal can result in different solubilities among the crystal facets, resulting in uneven growth or dissolution within individual crystals. The research will challenge current models of crystal growth and dissolution processes and will produce new insights into how impurities are released from crystalline materials, creating new routes to extracting potentially toxic impurities from pharmaceutical products. The project will contribute to the education of ten to twenty undergraduate students and one Ph.D. student, who will gain hands-on experience with crystallization processes and analysis of crystalline materials, a skillset valued in the pharmaceutical industry but rarely found in graduates joining the U.S. workforce.<br/><br/>This project presents a new approach to studying the effect of lattice-incorporated impurities on crystal solubility. The proposal is based on the premise that crystals can exhibit differing degrees of composition anisotropy, with certain regions being entirely responsible for hosting impurities. This motivates the research plan to investigate the effect that lattice impurities have on crystal form stability and solubility, that these properties should be studied with respect to individual crystal facets and not on powders (of crystals) as a whole. This project sets out to prove the hypothesis that a single crystal may present multiple solubility values across its lattice, and that those differences can be leveraged in the design of novel impurity separation strategies. This research project is divided in two research aims. In Aim 1, research will concentrate on characterizing anisotropy of impurities within single crystals and investigating how impurity gradients affect dissolution and growth. Aim 2 will then expand to the study of crystal suspension aging dynamics by investigating how coexisting pure and impure lattices affect the dissolution and growth behaviors during suspension aging. The research will make use of model anisotropic systems with transparent solutes and opaque impurities, where the presence and extent of anisotropy can be easily studied. The proposed research is integrated with an education plan that will provide undergraduate and graduate students with specialized skills in separation processes and materials science, as well as with experience working in multidisciplinary teams. The undergraduate students will be divided into two groups, aligned with the two Aims of the research proposal, resulting in an effective mechanism for integrating the PI?s research and education efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological cells contain active polymers - long filamentous molecules - that can consume energy and change connectivity and architecture during the cell cycle. The PI aims to develop a method that can provide insight into the dynamic reorganization of such systems.<br/><br/>The PI aims to investigate whether the many-chain geometry and topology of these filaments in combination with active interconnections among polymers alone can describe key elements that account for the mechanics of active matter filaments in many contexts. This research examines this hypothesis using an approach that involves mathematical ideas from the field of topology and computer simulation to obtain results that can be compared to experiments. The PI aims to use rigorous methods from mathematics to understand, model, and eventually control how polymer filaments entangle in active physical systems with biological applications. This project will lead to a better understanding of living matter and will advance the smart manufacturing of new soft glassy materials.<br/> <br/>This project also supports outreach activities, including public talks, university outreach programs, and the Challenger STEM Center, which can present aspects of the research to a potentially wide audience. Software and simulation techniques developed through this project will be shared broadly with the community. Results will be presented by the PI and her students at interdisciplinary conferences, including those organized by the PI. Additionally, the PI is strongly committed to broadening participation of underrepresented minorities and women in STEM; new courses will be developed to train interdisciplinary scientists in 21st-century mathematical tools. <br/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/> <br/>Active matter is used to classify a range of physical systems that are driven out of equilibrium by the presence of ''active'' constituents that exert forces by dissipating energy. Conventional polymer physics arguments provide limited understanding of the dynamic reorganization of such systems. A challenge in the field is to connect properties of isolated filaments to properties of a collection of filaments. This relates to a big challenge in the field of entangled polymers, which is how to measure entanglement of open curves in 3-space. This project will use topology, modeling, and simulation to measure topological entanglement in active matter filaments and provide a new model for its mechanics.  This research advances knowledge and breaks existing technical barriers (1) in topology by defining and studying the Jones polynomial of a collection of open curves in 3-space and in systems employing Periodic Boundary Conditions and (2) in understanding entanglement effects in materials science and biology, by providing a new model for the viscoelastic response of active matter filaments. This work is aimed to lead to predictive modeling of the behavior of such systems with the possibility of controlling their functions by judicious selection of their chemical compositions and structures, for example, by changing the number of active cross-links or the type of cross-linking motifs.  <br/> <br/>This award is jointly funded through the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research, and the Topology and Mathematical Biology Programs in the Division of Mathematical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Together, they form the Smart Logistics Engine. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted many chronic failure points in logistics systems stressed by multi-scalar economic, social, and natural crises. Solving these challenges at all scales and across the urban-to-rural spectrum is crucial to the future economic prosperity of the U.S. The Illinois-Indiana-Wisconsin-Missouri region is poised to lead in this sector because of its unique setting as a hub for all transportation modalities spanning river, air, road, and rail networks. This project is led by the Illinois Innovation Network, with Governors State University as the lead academic institution. Key partners across the state include Western Illinois, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, University of Illinois Chicago, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Eastern Illinois University.<br/><br/>In recent years, companies have been forced to reconfigure their supplier locations to build resiliency while simultaneously seeking to satisfy the demand for rapid delivery without product shortages. During this time, 68% of small businesses cited supply chain disruptions as having moderate to significant impacts on their business, and 87% of consumers were impacted by shortages and rationing. To solve these issues, this project will focus on three core activities: (1) automation of logistics for truck middle-mile freight systems, (2) autonomous drones and electric vehicles deployment, and (3) inland waterway freight delivery systems. The team will center its planning around translatable research demonstrating automation as a systemic enhancement and research incorporating drone and electric vehicle technologies across industry clusters. It will use intelligent logistics and design thinking to engage port managers, community leaders, and private sector partners to develop a regional, urban-to-rural waterborne commerce system and inclusive labor market. The project also will identify strategies for reskilling and upskilling individuals whose career paths are disrupted by automation while ensuring that workers in local and sub-regional economies can attain long-term participation in new industry clusters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Risk-aware inference procedures for deep learning such as Bayesian inference of deep neural networks (DNNs) can extract both prediction and prediction risks but also demand overwhelming computations. The inference procedures operate on random numbers and statistical density functions instead of real numbers for their higher expressivity. Meanwhile, their unique workload presents critical complexities for traditional semiconductors and microelectronics designed for digital workloads. To meet the distinct processing challenges, this teaming grant proposal explores the concepts of novel devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials and co-design methodologies that can process predominant inference operations using an ultra-low-power non-von Neumann execution. A cross-layer simulation tool will be developed to actively bridge the material and device-level novelties to computing model and architecture design space and to explore unconventional system design concepts. Especially our various co-design initiatives will be intersected into exploring autonomous navigation of insect-scale drones as a test platform. Autonomous insect-scale drones can engender unprecedented applications, e.g., our project can potentially enliven a typical internet-of-things into a flying internet-of-things where the sensors riding on insect-scale drones can continually self-organize in space against the changing environmental conditions. <br/><br/>The data-driven learning of deep neural networks (DNNs) significantly simplifies the complexity of model abstraction for many decision-making problems. Yet, the generated DNNs act like a black box and do not offer theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of the predictions. Significantly as our reliance on DNN-based predictive models is increasing for mission and safety-critical applications, it has become necessary to assess when DNN?s predictions are likely inaccurate. This teaming grant project explores concepts for future semiconductor technologies where more expressive DNN inference, where both the prediction and prediction risks, can be extracted while operating within the time and energy bounds of edge devices. Additionally, we will develop workshops on emerging co-design methodologies to address the workforce and talent demand for future semiconductor technologies and designs. We will instill co-design skills among undergraduate and graduate students by developing interdisciplinary course lectures and senior design projects. We will also foster a community of researchers on co-design space exploration by creating an online hub of resources such as open-source design kits, device models, and co-design exploration tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, Campus Champions will reflect on how to contribute and sustain activities in the ACCESS era. Second, existing, new and prospective Champions will tailor the program toward broader audiences. This will avail new and existing Campus Champions opportunities to connect in person and with the community, through discussion and social interaction. These events will enable bi-directional learning between the Campus Champions and the ACCESS program resources and outreach plans. People who are not Champions will be introduced to the community and learn practices to best support researchers at their institutions (if they support infrastructure) or to best utilize infrastructure (if they support researchers). Five candidates to receive travel funds to support participation in the events will be selected from under-resourced, non-R1 institutions based on their new (within the last 5 years) roles as non-traditional users or from an underrepresented category of Campus Champions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of social touch is becoming more evident as we increase remote communication through email, text messages and videoconferencing. Prior work has shown that social touch can be replicated through wearable and holdable devices, but current devices are bulky and impractical. This research will combine principles of soft robotics and knit textiles of varying stiffness to design and fabricate a new kind of soft wearable haptic device, in which careful specification of stitch size, placement, and material in a knit sleeve will control the deformation of pneumatic bladders that apply force to the wearer. Project outcomes will advance knowledge in the field of social touch and human perception, and will lay the foundation for a variety of other types of knit-textile-based devices, including soft assistive devices. Additional broad impact will derive from activities designed to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through lab tours, outreach programs, and mentoring of students from groups that are underrepresented in engineering, and by making project findings available to a wide audience through an open-source materials library.<br/><br/>Current soft wearable devices are bulky and impractical because they need stiff frames to ensure load transmission. The pixel-like control of material properties afforded by multi-material and multi-stitch knit textiles, on the other hand, can redirect force transmission to precise deformation modes efficiently and with a low profile. This project approaches designing, fabricating, and testing knit-enabled wearable devices in three thrusts. The first thrust will model and optimize knits to achieve target load and deformation profiles by using a combination of experimental material characterization and multiscale modeling to harness the full capabilities of the modern knitting process. The second thrust will design, fabricate, and test wearable pneumatic devices, including consideration for donning and doffing, actuator integration and interfacing, and device characterization. The third thrust will implement and test social touch cues using the device with pre-programmed haptic emojis and display of teleoperated social touch queues in real time. Taken together, these thrusts will create new forms of communication and lead to increased capabilities of wearable devices that improve human health and quality of life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The value of the facility is based on its location, well above the Arctic circle, high enough in elevation to be in the free troposphere, not influenced by human settlements or the moderating effects of the ocean, and the site of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) deep ice core. Summit StationT hosts the Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit), the only NSF site with permission from the Government of Greenland to provide long-term environmental measurements. Summit Station is staffed year-round and fills an important niche in the international scientific community?s global measurement capability. The Science Coordination Office (SCO) for Summit Station represents research interests that utilize the station, providing regular feedback to the managers of the Arctic Research Support and Logistics Program (RSL) and conveying information back to the research community about NSF?s plans for the station. The SCO presents the needs and desires of the science community working on the ice sheet in interior Greenland in discussions and decision making process between RSL and their primary logistics support contractor. NSF has stated plans to recapitalize the infrastructure at Summit Station and the SCO will ensure there is communication with the research community throughout the planning and design process. The SCO concurs with NSF?s goals to make a safe and sustainable Summit Station elevated above the drifting snow and preserving the clean air and clean snow research areas. The GEOSummit website has resources for new Principal Investigators, students and educators.<br/><br/>Summit Station, Greenland is the site of decades of study of deep ice cores, atmospheric chemistry, snow processes and, more recently, the study of high-energy neutrinos from the origins of the universe. Through this effort, the SCO will ensure that plans to operate and in coming years to recapitalize the infrastructure at Summit Station will be done with the interests of the research community. The SCO meets weekly with the arctic logistics contractor science support, logistics and operations at Summit Station to remain informed about plans and communicate research interests. The SCO is invited to review documents and provide input on plans for Summit Station. SCO will continue to advocate for Summit Station site plans that accommodate an influx of astrophysical research while maintaining long standing focus on research that needs clean air and snow conditions. The SCO helps prevent research projects from inadvertently interfering with each other. The SCO website is a keystone of communication to the science community, with several features added over the past few years such as the Google Earth based GIS, a virtual tour using Streetview images, a new Working at Summit section targeting new investigators, news from the station and a comprehensive bibliography of published work near Summit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RTCP is geared towards recruiting and retaining a new generation of estuarine and coastal science professionals. It consists of a 16-month program that supports attendance at the CERF and two additional coastal and estuarine conferences, with virtual meetings in between. The program provides professional and near-peer mentors, training, and networking, in addition to the full suite of scientific conference offerings. The LDP will provide leadership and DEIJA training for current and future leaders by building a dynamic learning community that will prepare emerging leaders to become agents of change while helping current leaders use existing power to address systemic inequities. The goals of C-COAST, from short- to long-term, are to 1): recruit and retain diverse undergraduate and graduate students and provide them professional development, mentorship, and peer networks to support a sense of belonging and identity; 2) educate current leaders on how to be more inclusive and change policies and practices that lead to inequities; and 3) increase the leadership skills of and opportunities for future leaders and prepare them to make policies and practices of CERF and their home institutions more inclusive when they are elevated to positions of power.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation?s Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) now routinely detects astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. Science now has an observatory that will allow us to peer into the cores of exploding stars, probe the interiors of neutron stars, and explore the extreme physics of colliding black holes. The discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 was accompanied by light across the electromagnetic spectrum and inaugurated the use of gravity as an instrument of multi-messenger astronomy. The dramatic breakthroughs made by LIGO and Virgo are only the beginning of our exploration of the gravitational-wave sky. Advanced LIGO is joined by Advanced Virgo, KAGRA, and eventually there will be the next-generation observatories, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. New algorithms are required to achieve the full scientific potential of the growing global observatory network. This award will support the development of new gravitational-wave search algorithms that will lay the foundation for the next generation and open a window to the discovery of new classes of merging binaries. Developing these algorithms will also equip students with the skills needed to enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This research investigates multi-detector coherent search algorithms that take advantage of Bayesian tools developed for gravitational-wave astronomy. The optimal approach to detect gravitational-wave sources is a fully Bayesian analysis that can coherently combine gravitational-wave data from multiple detectors and accurately model both gravitational-wave signals and detector noise which may contain non-Gaussian transient noise, aka ?glitches?. Currently employed searches employ heuristics that approximate the optimal approach and enable them to be tractable on available computing resources. While this has been an effective strategy for the early era of gravitational-wave astronomy, these approaches sacrifice sensitivity and flexibility.  Algorithms will be explored that enable efficient hierarchical analysis of gravitational-wave data and rapid Bayesian evidence estimation. This approach reduces the barriers between searching for sources and the estimation of source parameters, enabling the reuse of research in either regime into the modeling of glitches, detector nonstationarity, and overlapping signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent decades, wildfires have become an increasing threat to humans, the built environment, and ecosystems due to climate change, increased human activities at the wildland-urban interface, and changes in land use. While federal, state, and local governments have developed and implemented risk management strategies to reduce the frequency and negative impact of large wildfires, these strategies are often based on static, outdated, and coarse-scale estimates of wildfire risk. Moreover, they do not often engage citizens whose actions are crucial for reducing damage at the property level and whose protective efforts affect the risk levels of their neighbors and the surrounding environment. A lack of sustained citizen engagement and limited information flows in hazard-prone communities presents a barrier to informed, optimal decision-making by both government officials and individuals. This CAREER project aims to integrate fire science, risk assessment principles, and decision-making processes to establish the foundation for a new approach to wildfire risk assessment and management that evolves over time and captures relevant changes occurring at multiple spatial-temporal scales. This integrated approach centers around a dynamic, interactive, next-generation Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) platform that facilitates active citizen engagement and multidirectional information exchange. The project provides students, practitioners, policymakers, and the public with opportunities to advance their understanding of wildfire risks and contribute to mitigating its negative impacts through new academic courses, training sessions, and an online exhibition. <br/><br/>This CAREER project stimulates a paradigm shift from traditional, static wildfire risk assessment and management plans to a dynamic, interactive platform that (a) allows citizens to engage with their local governments and neighbors in mitigation decision processes and (b) enables both governments and citizens to make joint risk-informed decisions about wildfire mitigation through multidirectional information exchanges. This project first builds an evolutionary game-theoretic model to characterize decision-making between governments and citizens in interdependent wildfire risk contexts. It then develops a risk assessment model that employs ongoing data collection and processing over time. Finally, this project integrates these models and tools into a prototype CWPP platform to demonstrate its technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness while soliciting user feedback. By fostering collaboration between local governments and citizens, the project has the potential to aid the transition of the responsibility for disaster risk reduction from emergency personnel to that of the entire community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology could significantly reduce the greater than $3 billion cost to the US healthcare system from implant related infections. This antimicrobial technology could be used beyond medical applications for such things as food packaging to decrease foodborne diseases and more than double shelf-life of certain food products. Additionally, the linker technology developed through this project may be used to create super slick or self-cleaning surfaces with applications in the aerospace and marine industries resulting in increased fuel efficiency and performance.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop a homogeneous, covalently bound, linker molecule attached to medical implant material (titanium alloy) upon which a quaternary ammonium-modified oligosaccharide will be subsequently attached. Oligosaccharides are known to be biocompatible and quaternized oligosaccharides are highly potent antimicrobials. A treated medical implant could possess a powerfully antimicrobial surface so that, during surgery, any bacteria that encounter the surface will be killed. In this way, it is hoped that the avascular surface of the implant will not serve as a site for biofilm formation and growth and thus, reduce the incidence of perioperative infections. The key to any successful surface modification is the quality of the chemical attachment of linkers and active molecules to that surface. Polyphenols and catechols such as dopamine are ideal candidates for investigation as these molecules are generally known for their facility in forming thin films onto a wide variety of surfaces. Using dopamine as a model system, catechol analogs will be electrochemically attached, and the resulting thin films analyzed for attachment, thickness, ease of further modification, and morphology.

The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) will assist the next generation of coastal and estuarine biologists and related disciplines in navigating the current culture while simultaneously dismantling inequities at the root of low DEIJA in the disciplines through the Changing the Culture of our Occupations to Achieve Systemic Transformation (C-COAST) program, which will provide professional development, mentoring, and networking to students and professionals at all career stages.<br/><br/>The C-COAST program will harness evidence-based strategies to mitigate inequities and shift culture in the coastal and estuarine sciences through two programs: Rising TIDES Conference Program (RTCP) and Leadership Development Program (LDP). The RTCP is geared towards recruiting and retaining a new generation of estuarine and coastal science professionals. It consists of a 16-month program that supports attendance at the CERF and two additional coastal and estuarine conferences, with virtual meetings in between. The program provides professional and near-peer mentors, training, and networking, in addition to the full suite of scientific conference offerings. The LDP will provide leadership and DEIJA training for current and future leaders by building a dynamic learning community that will prepare emerging leaders to become agents of change while helping current leaders use existing power to address systemic inequities. The goals of C-COAST, from short- to long-term, are to 1): recruit and retain diverse undergraduate and graduate students and provide them professional development, mentorship, and peer networks to support a sense of belonging and identity; 2) educate current leaders on how to be more inclusive and change policies and practices that lead to inequities; and 3) increase the leadership skills of and opportunities for future leaders and prepare them to make policies and practices of CERF and their home institutions more inclusive when they are elevated to positions of power.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An SGRB is one of the most energetic explosions in the cosmos and is triggered by the collision of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. It is accompanied by the emission of electromagnetic radiation across a wide range of wavelengths, as well as gravitational waves. While the prototypical binary neutron star collision, GW170817, expanded our understanding of such bursts in unprecedented ways, it also left certain questions unresolved. One such question is the fate of these collisions, which have been conjectured to affect the afterglows of SGRBs. This work will support multi-messenger astronomical observations of SGRB counterparts of gravitational wave (GW) signals in LIGO and Virgo to understand the nature of the remnants produced by them. The project will involve citizen scientists in this investigation via the development of Machine Learning tools for distinguishing noise artifacts in GW detectors that can masquerade as GW signals from these collisions. It will also contribute to training students at the Tri-Cities campus of the Washington State University and education and public outreach activities in neighboring areas. This campus is close to the LIGO-Hanford site and caters to a large percentage of Hispanic and Native-American populations. <br/><br/>This project will enhance the science exploitation of gravitational-wave observations with LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA during their fourth and fifth observation runs. It will reduce the number of false alarms among the low-latency alerts issued by those detectors. For this purpose, it will specifically target GW signals from binaries involving neutron stars. This aids astronomical observatories that follow-up these GW alerts in their quest for detecting accompanying electromagnetic and particle emissions. The project will pursue this objective by (a) contributing to the more complete accounting of sources of non-Gaussian transient noise, (b) identifying different types of non-linear couplings of noise sources, and (c) improving the significance measurement of online GW alerts by utilizing Machine Learning solutions and automated data quality inputs. It will also develop signal-based noise discriminators, or ?chi-square? tests, for targeting especially those noise artifacts that are responsible for a majority of false alerts. Observations of these binaries will be used to improve our understanding of the neutron star equation of state and gravitational-wave aided measurements of the Hubble constant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The organisms, such as seaweeds, that can live in these zones are poorly known. One such zone extends approximately 30-150 m deep off the coastlines of the Hawaiian Islands. An initial six-year study of seaweeds in this habit found that 52% of the species were new to science. Characterizing and describing these species is important for developing a greater understanding of the distribution of marine organisms across the tropical Pacific, for tracking invasive species, and for contributing to the larger goal of understanding global biodiversity. This project will collect, identify and describe mesophotic seaweeds from Hawaii, adding to biodiversity data and herbarium collections, and new species discovery. Additionally, this research will allow the first investigation into genome-level adaptations of red, green, and brown seaweeds that live in the low-light environment of the mesophotic zone. Importantly, a key goal of this project includes training the next generation of algal biologists for current-day jobs through exposure to the most up-to-date DNA sequencing techniques, training in herbarium curation, genomics, bioinformatics, and ecological and evolutionary analyses. The goals and results of the research will be broadly communicated through numerous outreach events, scientific conferences, and peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>The mesophotic algal flora of the Hawaiian Islands will be characterized using genome skimming and morphological analysis to speed the pathway to description of new species. Hawaiian language names for new species of seaweeds will be developed through a partnership with the NOAA Cultural Working Group. Closely related pairs of species from mesophotic and shallow marine habitats, including green, red, and brown algal species, will be analyzed with a comparative genomics approach. Data will be used to test hypotheses of biogeography in the tropical Pacific, evolution of mesophotic algae, and genomic adaptations to life in the mesophotic zone. This research leverages partnerships with scientists, agencies, and others that have been forged over the past decade to sample from remote field sites and mesophotic depths. Deliverables include permanently archived collections of Hawaiian mesophotic specimens, open access to all project data through a web accessible database (hosted at Bishop Museum), establishment of a baseline mesophotic algae dataset to aid identification and screening, systematic revision of select taxa, and an updated species checklist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The civic promise of social media was universal access to the knowledge needed to inform and motivate broad political engagement on controversial issues.  Instead, social media have become the Petri dish for epistemic polarization ? the division of the public into red and blue realities.  The spread of polarizing unverifiable statements over social media erodes the shared knowledge needed for constructive disagreement and allows foreign adversaries to mount toxic communication campaigns with frightening virality.  Through analysis of old and new social media data and development of new analytic methods, the research in this project brings a greater understanding of the diffusion dynamics of misleading statements. This will be useful in improving the trustworthiness of cyberspace.<br/><br/>Using previously collected ten-year Twitter archive, along with new data to be collected, curated, and anonymized, in this project the impact of polarization on the dissemination of misleading statements in online networks is investigated. The new data set will be the largest publicly available data set of its kind, contributing to future research on this topic. In addition, analytical methods are developed to evaluate the ideological content, veracity of messages, alignment of users, and the structural and temporal characteristics of misleading statement cascades, such as reach, velocity, and virality. What results from this work is a deeper understanding of the diffusion dynamics of misleading statements. This can inform an early-containment counterstrategy that can more effectively identify, track, and neutralize diffusion before the contagion can spread out of control.

However, these searches have not yet begun to access the full, rich discovery space of gravitational-wave signals. In particular, if binary black holes have large, misaligned spins and asymmetric masses, then the binary?s orbit will precess. The resulting gravitational waves can have significant amplitude and phase modulations, causing the signals to be missed entirely by current searches. However, measurement of these modulations would allow us to disentangle various binary parameters, enabling more accurate probes of fundamental physics in the strong-gravity regime than are possible with current detections. This award supports the development of tools needed to search for and potentially detect this important class of precessing signals. Additionally, this work will provide data-analysis skill training for undergraduates participating in this research with the PI, particularly through the ACCOMPLISH program at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth which seeks to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high achieving undergraduates. <br/><br/>The work supported by this award will access the interesting class of precessing binary black holes using a two-pronged approach. The PI and a PhD student will design and perform a gravitational-wave search for moderately-precessing binary systems using a two-harmonic approximation to the precessing waveform, enabling the exploitation of the well-behaved morphology of the separate harmonics. Additionally, the group will design and perform a gravitational-wave search for highly-precessing binary systems using a generalization of the matched-filter statistic over a constrained region of parameter space. These searches will be deployed over archival gravitational-wave data, potentially making a detection of a precessing gravitational-wave signal or setting meaningful upper limits on the rates of mergers of such systems. The development work enabled by this award will inform future directions for more complex searches in general, particularly as we move to the third generation of gravitational-wave detectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project extends the operational frequency range of wireless communication devices to the next stage of 5G operation by developing new materials. Higher operating frequencies mean higher data rates, but the compact, efficient, and low-cost acoustic components that dominate the wireless handset market today are limited by the fundamental properties of the materials at their core.  The current alternatives to the existing materials are bulky, inefficient and lead to rapid battery drain with unacceptable heating during data transmission. Extending these acoustic components into the 6 ? 10 GHz region requires a high throughput screening combined with co-design approach to rapidly and efficiently develop new materials with enabling properties that can be rapidly leveraged by novel device designs and chips manufacturing. This project builds from fundamental materials concepts of non-linear alloy behavior to extend these components into emerging 5G communication bands.<br/><br/>The proposed project will address the open scientific question of how to accurately compute the speed of sound of complex alloys from first principles, including multi-scale chemical ordering, using tools that we have recently developed. Guided by such tools, we will leverage high throughput experimental screening capabilities to fabricate new piezoelectric alloys with higher acoustic velocities than existing options. This process will increase our understanding of the energetic non-equilibrium fabrication via reactive sputtering and electromechanical properties of complex multi-cation and simultaneously multi-anion alloys. Development and property optimization of these newly conceived piezoelectrics having increased acoustic velocity and reduced permittivity will be coupled to novel device structures to demonstrate acoustic resonators at >6 GHz operating frequencies. Co-design of the new materials that exhibit enabling properties and the resonators that can leverage said properties will lead to compact, low-cost, high efficiency filters for wireless handsets for >6 GHz operation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques. The prototype implementations will be integrated in real systems to test how the proposed accumulator protocols perform in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, researchers looking to contribute to this area of work face several challenges related to building and maintaining tooling that can keep pace with the rapid evolution of mobile platforms (e.g., new Android updates) and the continuous process of mining apps and app-related data. This project aims to carry out planning activities that will lead to the construction of a new shared community infrastructure for conducting mobile app development research. This infrastructure, called MODAL, will support work across the disciplines of software engineering (SE), computer security, and human-computer interaction (HCI) by offering various configurable components supporting key steps of the research process.<br/><br/>This project will (1) conduct a preliminary survey of the SE, computer security, and HCI communities to understand the mobile app research needs of these communities, (2) conduct interviews to understand the barriers researchers face and how a specific community infrastructure can mitigate these barriers, (3) host workshops to facilitate the exchange of best practices used for mining data and building analysis tools to guide the development of the infrastructure, (4) conduct a working group to explore the design of the infrastructure with existing researchers, researchers new to the topic, and educators of the topic, and (5) conduct a summative survey to assess the proposed infrastructure?s ability to support mobile app research. <br/><br/>The improved tools and techniques proposed by this project will better support app developers, enabling them to write higher quality applications, potentially impacting billions of app users. This project will also explore the potential for using the envisioned infrastructure to teach students how to effectively write mobile app software. Finally, as part of the proposed planning activities, barriers and challenges related to research on mobile app development will be uncovered that will inform new types of classroom pedagogy and new tools that will benefit novice researchers.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is the creation of a sustainable open-source community centered around the proposed research infrastructure.

Marine microbes are typically far apart from one another, so some of these exchanges occur through the release of products or services into the surrounding water, where they travel to other cells via simple diffusion. Understanding the degree to which such valuable products made by one organism are targeted to a specific partner, and how, has important implications for our understanding of the ecology and evolution of the marine microbiome. This project examines the role played by a poorly understood type of very small particle ? extracellular membrane vesicles ? in mediating functional interactions within the oceans. Extracellular vesicles are released by most marine microbes and are abundant in ocean waters, but our understanding of their functions remains in its infancy. As vesicles can contain diverse molecules, including active enzymes, and transport them between cells, they may work as a packaging and delivery system for goods and services traded between ecologically important microorganisms. Broader impacts of the project include providing hands-on research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students - including those from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields - and the development of new active learning exercises to help increase knowledge about the roles microbes play in students? lives.<br/><br/>This project explores vesicle functions across multiple scales, combining -omics analyses, field experiments, and functional studies in cultures of diverse and ecologically important microbes to arrive at new understandings of vesicle contributions to cellular exchanges. These experiments incorporate an evolutionary perspective for exploring the range of vesicle functions and genetic mechanisms affecting their production, examining how their contents have changed in co-cultures of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria following hundreds of generations of experimental laboratory evolution. Fundamental ecological questions are addressed concerning whether vesicles, and their associated functions, act as truly ?public goods? in the oceans or can instead be targeted to a subset of cells, possibly yielding ?club goods? that define interacting, cooperative networks. Collectively, this effort will generate new insights into the mechanisms marine microbes use to interact with one another, and experimentally define the functional potential and ecological impact of EV-mediated trafficking networks in the oceans. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biological Oceanography Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coatings are rarely found in a power plant condenser due to their poor durability. Existing enhanced condensers rely on low-fin tubes, which are costly and can only improve the condensation heat transfer of water marginally (< 150%). In addition to efficiency limitations, fouling and corrosion also are two major pain points for heat exchangers. The proposed technology is designed to achieve superior thermal and chemical properties, including high thermal conductivity, anti-corrosion, self-healing, and potentially anti-fouling.  It is based on an engineered surface that can be retrofitted into existing or incorporated into newly built heat exchangers.  In addition, the proposed technology has shown the potential to enhance energy and water efficiency across multiple industries and applications, including power generation, chemical processing, and marine applications.  Due to its water repellency, this technology potentially may address fouling and corrosion problems for even broader applications, such as industrial cooling, agriculture, and the petrochemical industry. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a hybrid coating to enhance thermal conductivity and durability.  The proposed technology is the combination of densely packed metal nanostructures with a hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer.  In laboratory experiments conducted over 200 days, it was shown that over 700% condensation heat transfer of water was achieved on a coated sample as compared to a bare metal surface.  In addition, the corrosion rate measured on the coated sample was 100x slower than on a copper substrate, demonstrating high anti-corrosion performance.  Further, the manufacturing process does not require chemical vapor deposition, which may allow scalable and affordable manufacturing.  The proposed technology shows potential to improve energy efficiency and water conservation in power plant condensers as well as other applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prescribed burns are one of the most effective ways to prevent the uncontrolled, large-scale wildfires that devastate entire ecosystems, communities, and economies, but the environmental assessment required for burns may delay the burn by months or years due to overburdened agencies. The innovation addresses this pain point with an automated survey solution, reducing both the paperwork burden and the potential for error in burn area vegetation mapping and spatial fire modeling. The solution ensures that prescribed burn plans use the best available vegetation data, providing fire managers with an accurate prediction of expected fire behavior for determining control strategy, staffing, and resources. This innovation would be the first automated prescribed burn spatial fire modeling solution using an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). This innovation meets the STTR program?s focus on unproven, high-impact innovations because sub-canopy mapping by UAV is a cutting-edge application of autonomous flight, with challenges in optimization and decision-making. The application of UAV technology to prescribed burn environmental assessments will help to address the growing wildfire crisis in the United States by reducing the delay between the decision to burn at a selected site and the execution of the burn. <br/><br/>The technical hurdles to be addressed by the proposed project include both real-time, sub-canopy 3D mapping and optimization for constraints across sensor requirements, cluttered environment exploration, and SWAP (size, weight, and power) limitations. The goals are to produce a high-fidelity, open-source. UAV exploration environment, to implement 3D mapping on a resource-constrained computer that meets UAV payload requirements, to incorporate species-specific decision-making criteria into the UAV exploration algorithm, and to conduct validation testing to verify technical and early commercial feasibility.

Additionally, the findings may inform models for understanding and reconstructing behavior from fossil primates and hominins. The project will foster international research collaborations, provide STEM training opportunities for a female postdoctoral scientist and multiple undergraduate and graduate students, and support four early-career female scientists. Results will be used to develop primate behavior and anatomy exercises for K-12 students and provide training for K-12 teachers to effectively deliver those exercises.

The central goal of the proposed research is to examine how immature primates cope with feeding performance constraints, such as maximum jaw gape and bite force, during ontogeny. To address this goal, this study will compare feeding system development in two related primate species, one that exploits hard, tough and relatively large foods, and one that eats smaller, less mechanically-challenging foods.  Specifically this project will: 1) integrate experimental and ecological data addressing developmental shifts in food properties, feeding behavior, and feeding system function and morphology in closely related primate species; 2) establish functional relationships between diet and morphology in immature primates to examine how selection for particular feeding behaviors during development relates to adult morphologies and maintains feeding performance throughout ontogeny; and 3) integrate data on feeding system skeletal morphology with data on critical determinants of feeding system performance, including food properties, bite force, and gape.

Accurate measurements of the ocean's warming are critical for understanding Earth's energy imbalance and climate anomalies. This project will employ a novel method of using seismic Scholte waves excited by repeating natural submarine earthquakes to monitor the global large-scale abyssal ocean warming. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the method, which will be expanded to the global ocean. Existing seismic data can be used to track abyssal oceawn warming back to the 1990s. The results will complement hydrographic measurements and improve understanding of the dynamics of the response of the abyssal ocean to surface forcing.<br/><br/>This work will provide new observational constraints on abyssal ocean warming over the past few decades. The investigators will systematically search for shallow submarine repeating earthquakes since the 1980s. Scholte waves excited by these repeating events travel along the seafloor, and their propagation speed is sensitive to abyssal temperatures. Scholte wave travel time changes between repeating events thus constrain abyssal temperature change. The sensitivity of Scholte wave travel times to abyssal temperatures will be calculated using numerical simulations of wave propagation. Sensitivity kernels will be used to interpret the measured travel time changes, to infer average abyssal ocean warming along the waves' path, and to quantify uncertainties. The inferred warming will be compared against hydrographic and Argo data where available. Providing direct estimates of basin-scale abyssal ocean warming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The three-dimensional low steepness ripples commonly observed in medium and fine sand beaches (median grain size of 0.15-0.3 mm) have received much less attention compared to the high steepness coarse sand ripples, even though the medium and fine sand beaches are more common in nature. Furthermore, the migration of medium and fine sand ripples may contribute to a significant part of the beach profile evolution. The proposed work will apply numerical modeling methods to study medium and fine sand ripples driven by waves and currents. The Large Eddy Simulation (LES) two-phase flow methodology will be applied to understand the geometry and migration of medium-fine ripples in the presence of flow separation vortices, flow instabilities, and turbulent coherent structures in a turbulence-resolving system.<br/><br/>Medium and fine sand ripples will be studied using a large-eddy simulation (LES) Eulerian two-phase methodology. The steepness of medium-fine sand ripples is both low and capricious, and it is hypothesized in this project that their evolution is dictated by flow instabilities and coherent structures such that the conventional paradigm which separates the primary vortices from the cascade of turbulent coherent structures is inadequate. The proposed work is expected to gain a new understanding of explaining the geometry and migration of medium and fine sand ripples, deliver an open-source numerical simulation model capable of simulating low steepness ripples, and inform improved parameterizations on transport rate and migration. The project will test the hypothesis that the Reynolds-averaged modeling approach that objectively separates the energy cascade of turbulent coherent structures from the resolved primary vortices becomes inadequate for low steepness ripples. This project will create the first turbulence-resolving (LES) Eulerian two-phase model capable of simulating the geometry and migration of medium and fine sand ripples by extending the existing open-source model, SedFoam.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If broadly adopted, this solution will reduce annual carbon emissions by about 0.5 gigatons annually and bring air conditioning to the point of affordability for many of the two billion people who increasingly need it, but can?t afford it. The global AC market is about $120 Billion annually and the industry has been served essentially by the same vapor compression technology invented over a century ago. That technology is inefficient and, for vast numbers of people around the world, unaffordable due to its large electricity expense. The proposed technology has the potential to disrupt this market by providing a two-thirds reduction in power use. This project also has the potential to lead to the commercialization of a new class of membranes that can increase the efficiency and decrease the cost associated with high-salinity fluid treatment applications such as lithium recovery, wastewater treatment, and water desalinization. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, hollow-fiber membrane technology tailored to operate with high flux in a liquid desiccant AC system. Commercial off-the-shelf membranes are not designed for this high-concentration environment and, if used in a commercial implementation of the system, would drive its size and cost to the point which would limit the product?s marketability. This project?s objective is to demonstrate a customized membrane design and quantify the membrane?s impact on the proposed AC system?s efficiency, size, and cost.  The proposed research will accomplish this by a series of design/fab/test iterations followed by an update to the system and techno-economic models using the measured characteristics of the final membrane. This solution will broaden membrane developers? understanding of the design and potential of high-concentration membranes. Beyond its applicability to the liquid desiccant cooling technology, a high-concentration membrane would have broad applicability to multiple high brine concentration applications, including mineral recovery operations such as performed during lithium mining, zero liquid discharge wastewater treatments, and high-brine water desalination pursued in arid regions of the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Civil infrastructure is increasingly moving underground, including roadways, transit, utilities, and facilities. However, risk in underground construction remains a critical barrier to attracting investment. A significant risk in building underground is the high uncertainty in ground conditions and physical properties influencing design and construction, resulting in increased costs due to over-design and/or delays and failures during construction. This project strives to improve the understanding of ground conditions by providing a solution to update the ground models during construction in a routine and autonomous manner, making full use of the wealth of data collected during construction. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a technical solution that automates the process of back-analyzing ground properties and updating ground models in real time. Several technical challenges will be addressed. Current backanalyses practice is extraordinarily labor-intensive and expensive in managing and integrating data from underground infrastructure projects. The dynamic environment during construction requires 4D inversion analysis on potentially hundreds of unique tunnel-structure interactions. Furthermore, the efficacy of the inversion in estimating geotechnical parameters, which has been demonstrated for only limited situations during the fundamental development of the techniques, needs to be validated. The goals of the proposed research are to (1) develop algorithms to automatically integrate data from geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring, construction process monitoring, existing infrastructure, apriori geostatistical model, etc., (2) develop algorithms to dynamically update the geotechnical parameter inversion in spatial proximity of tunnel construction to adjacent structures, sensors, and ground conditions, (3) characterize the geotechnical parameter inversion efficacy across a broad variety of ground conditions and tunneling-structure interactions, and (4) learn the influence of sensing layout and optimized sensing on inversion efficacy.

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques.

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques. The prototype implementations will be integrated in real systems to test how the proposed accumulator protocols perform in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ICAD is the premier international forum for presenting research on the use of sound to display data, monitor systems, and provide enhanced user interfaces for computers and virtual reality systems.  It is unique in its singular focus on auditory displays and the array of perception, technology, and application areas that this encompasses, which include for example data sonification, auditory wayfinding, auditory graphs, speech interfaces, virtual environments, and associated perceptual, cognitive, technical, and technological research and development.  Many of the interdisciplinary research and development efforts are of direct relevance to persons with perceptual disabilities, especially visual impairments. This year's conference theme is ""Sonification for the Masses""; more details about ICAD 2023 are available online at https://icad2023.icad.org/.  <br/><br/>The ICAD ThinkTank is a doctoral consortium that promotes scholarship and networking among new researchers in this important emerging interdisciplinary area.  This full-day workshop will take place on June 26 immediately preceding the conference proper, The event will develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, by providing participants with a friendly and open, yet rigorous, scientific forum in which to present their research ideas, to listen to ongoing work from peers, and to receive constructive feedback from a panel of distinguished experts.  Panel feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  The ThinkTank will also offer invited speakers and discussion groups (e.g., to provide students with relevant information about important issues for doctoral candidates, whether they are considering academic or industrial career paths).  Student participants will present their work via posters during the conference technical program, and via extended abstracts published on the ICAD 2023 website.  Thus, the ThinkTank will help shape ongoing and future research projects that have clear and important implications for development of assistive technologies and universal access.  It will bring together students from diverse disciplines (such as engineering, computing, music, and psychology), so that they can experience the broad spectrum of approaches to auditory displays, assistive technologies and universal design. It will afford participants exposure to a larger community, allowing them to bond among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality and culture, scientific discipline, and institution, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field. This year, the organizers expect that up to ten U.S.-based ThinkTank Scholars will have their travel and attendance heavily subsidized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is done by packaging the cells in a scaffold, which is encapsulated in a semi-permeable isolating membrane. The packaged cells are connected to the host?s vasculature via a tube (anastomosis graft) transporting oxygen and nutrients rich blood to the cells. The semi-permeable encapsulating membrane, located at the interface between the blood flow in the graft and the cell scaffold, is designed to block the host?s immune cells from attacking the transplanted cells, while allowing passage of oxygen and nutrients to the cells. A major challenge in cell encapsulation is sufficient oxygen and nutrients supply to maintain the long-term viability of cells. The main goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive multi-scale and multi-physics mathematical and computational framework modeling cell encapsulation. Using this framework, The PIs will address the long-term viability of encapsulated cells by (1) studying how hydrogel architecture and elasticity affect oxygen and nutrients supply to the cells, and by (2) exploring design of ultrafiltrate channels within the hydrogel to maximize oxygen and nutrients supply to the cells. The concept of cell encapsulation is highly relevant for bioartificial organs design and for controlled delivery of biological therapeutics. This interdisciplinary project will provide mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students at the interface between mathematics and biology. A new graduate course at Texas Tech will be introduced to train students in the state-or-the-art mathematical methods developed in this project.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive multi-scale, multi-physics mathematical and computational model of cell encapsulation for bioartificial organs design. At the macro-scale, two sets of time-dependent coupled models will be developed and analyzed: (1) a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model between the Stokes/Navier-Stokes equations and the Biot membrane equations coupled to the nonlinear Biot poroelastic medium equations, and (2) a set of coupled nonlinear advection-reaction-diffusion equations defined on moving domains describing oxygen concentration in the encapsulated organ. Two partitioned schemes will be developed to solve the FSI problem and the coupled advection-reaction-diffusion problems. The numerical schemes will be designed to deal with the novel coupling conditions holding across a Biot poroelastic membrane interface, defined on a ?mixed?? 2D/3D domain. Stability analysis and convergence tests will be performed. To capture the impact of micro-scale hydrogel architecture on local hydraulic conductivity, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations will be used. The results of the SPH simulations will provide synthetic data for the Encoder-Decoder Convolution Neural Networks training (offline) to produce macro-scale parameters, such as the hydrogel permeability tensor, needed in macro-scale simulations. Validation and parameter estimation will be provided by the experiments at the UCSF Biodesign Laboratory. The results from this research will advance the knowledge in mathematical FSI involving poroelastic media and in coupled nonlinear advection-reaction-diffusion systems on moving domains. The outcomes of the findings will advance the knowledge in cell encapsulation for bioartificial organ design and in controlled delivery of biological therapeutics.<br/><br/>This proposal is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program of the Division of Mathematical Science (DMS), the Fluid Dynamics Program and the Engineering of Biomedical Systems (EBMS) Program, both in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division, Directorate for Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If these organizations fail, the core integrity property is lost. Blockchains systems form the critical infrastructure and technology for decentralizing trust to multiple parties such that integrity is maintained even if some of them are malicious. Due to the value of the information stored, these systems need the ability to tolerate a significant fraction of malicious parties,  ensure these parties do not have an incentive to misbehave, and hold parties accountable and recover in case of an attack. Moreover, for scalability, these systems need to have low communication complexity, good latency, and support private transactions. Unfortunately, existing blockchain systems do not meet all of these requirements. This project makes novel scientific advances by bridging the gap between theoretical foundations and the practical aspects of blockchain consensus by considering several properties such as accountability, practical failure models, and privacy. The project's broader significance and importance include: (i) improved designs for public blockchains such as Ethereum and Zcash, industry-based permissioned blockchains such as VMware Concord, and applications such as decentralized finance and Central Banking Digital Currencies, (ii) a comprehensive education, dissemination, and outreach plan resulting in (a) new graduate and undergraduate courses with open-source materials, (b) the mentoring of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students ? especially from underrepresented minorities in computing, and (c) organizing events that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on blockchains.<br/><br/>The project exploits and reveals synergies between distributed computing, theory, privacy, game theory, and computer systems. It answers fundamental research questions on 1) defining and studying mechanisms for fault detection and recovery and how they act as a feedback loop to the security and efficiency of the system, 2) designing secure and efficient self-stabilizing synchronous protocols tolerating minority corruption, 3) analyzing consensus in the presence of rational parties, and 4) understanding the limits of and designing randomized privacy mechanisms for privacy-preserving proof-of-stake protocols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the importance of early math, researchers and educators have created a variety of classroom-focused resources to support mathematical learning, thinking, and skill development. However, many of these resources do not take into account the important roles that parents, and the home learning environment play in supporting math learning and engagement. Current efforts also do not go far enough in countering deficit perspectives on families and moving beyond engagement strategies and activity structures based primarily on cultural models of learning from White, monolingual, middle- and upper-class communities. To achieve a new vision of equitable math learning in early childhood, it is important to disrupt power hierarchies between minoritized families and schools and reposition parents as central to children?s mathematics learning. Educators and researchers must also reconceptualize traditional ideas about math that are rooted in histories of marginalization and discrimination.<br/><br/>To advance approaches for addressing these systemic barriers, the project, Viviendo Matematicas, will conduct an equity-informed design-based implementation research (DBIR) study with the goal of developing a potentially transformative model for collaborating with Latinx families and early childhood educators to shape a more equitable vision of mathematics education in the preschool years.  Partnering with Head Start educators in Portland, OR, and New York, NY and Latinx parents with preschool-age children (3?5 years) who are Head Start eligible based on the  household's lower income, the project will extend prior equity work by using dialogic and asset-based approaches to amplify existing math knowledge and practices within families, broaden our collective understanding and appreciation of mathematics inside and outside the classroom, and identify design principles for parent educator collaborations that can be shared with other communities. Through the iterative, community-based design process, the project will deliver: (a) a strength-based framework describing Latinx early childhood math practices, (b) a program model and associated resources for supporting parent-educator math dialogue groups, and (c) design principles and theoretical frameworks underlying the dialogue program and how it supports a more equitable vision of math learning. By reorganizing traditional relationships between parents and school, the project seeks to empower Latinx parents and families as equal partners and advocates for their children?s education, as well as support the creation of sustainable resources for Head Start programs in our communities that align with families? goals and values.<br/><br/>This collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EDU Racial Equity).

While XR is deemed as the killer application of 5G and beyond, existing work has mainly focused on improving the quality of experience (QoE) for single-user scenarios, and there is limited research on exploring the underlying infrastructure to support emerging immersive applications, especially multi-user collaboration and interaction involving participants from geo-distributed locations. This project aims to design and develop the infrastructure for Collaborative Mobile Immersive Computing (CoMIC), which fills this critical gap and lays the technical foundation for realizing the grand vision of the Metaverse. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of CoMIC includes: (1) constructing a research infrastructure with both software and hardware components for advancing collaborative immersive computing and (2) serving the community by empowering innovative solutions of multi-user XR. CoMIC will develop a first-of-its-kind, open-accessible, and reconfigurable research infrastructure, which is naturally required by various use cases such as education, training, healthcare, and entertainment. It strives to offer a collaborative, visual-first, and hologram-based computing space and a QoE-driven, multi-site, and immersive communication framework by providing a shared environment for community users. CoMIC will be open to and support in-person visits of community users to facilitate their research projects. <br/><br/>This project will create broader impacts on research infrastructure, education and training, societies, and economies, and broaden computing participation. Currently, the research and development of multi-user XR have been hindered because the underlying infrastructure with essential building blocks is still missing. CoMIC will timely bridge this critical gap and significantly speed up the realization of the Metaverse vision. The CoMIC platform offers a unique research opportunity for students and will be used to educate and train the next generation of researchers and engineers to master the key technologies and system design skills in immersive computing and advance the frontiers of science and engineering. <br/><br/>This collaborative project brings together investigators from George Mason University and the University of Maryland to build the CoMIC infrastructure. Its remotely accessible and programmable robots mounted with XR devices and mmWave 5G edge networks can enable the comparison of different solutions in a consistent way. Users can download the CoMIC software to set up their own testbed, replace the CoMIC components in the reference implementation, and experiment with their own multi-user XR solutions.

The civic promise of social media was universal access to the knowledge needed to inform and motivate broad political engagement on controversial issues.  Instead, social media have become the Petri dish for epistemic polarization ? the division of the public into red and blue realities.  The spread of polarizing unverifiable statements over social media erodes the shared knowledge needed for constructive disagreement and allows foreign adversaries to mount toxic communication campaigns with frightening virality.  Through analysis of old and new social media data and development of new analytic methods, the research in this project brings a greater understanding of the diffusion dynamics of misleading statements. This will be useful in improving the trustworthiness of cyberspace.<br/><br/>Using previously collected ten-year Twitter archive, along with new data to be collected, curated, and anonymized, in this project the impact of polarization on the dissemination of misleading statements in online networks is investigated. The new data set will be the largest publicly available data set of its kind, contributing to future research on this topic. In addition, analytical methods are developed to evaluate the ideological content, veracity of messages, alignment of users, and the structural and temporal characteristics of misleading statement cascades, such as reach, velocity, and virality. What results from this work is a deeper understanding of the diffusion dynamics of misleading statements. This can inform an early-containment counterstrategy that can more effectively identify, track, and neutralize diffusion before the contagion can spread out of control.

There is overwhelming evidence that inclusive teaching and evidence-based learning strategies increase students' performance in STEM classes. Separately, there is ample evidence on best practices for STEM faculty development. However, few studies directly link faculty professional development to student success via measurement of changes in faculty practices. This project aims to change classroom culture across five STEM departments at a major research-intensive institution through focused workshops for faculty and ongoing engagement in an interdisciplinary faculty learning community. It plans to investigate in what ways and to what extent faculty professional development can impact student engagement and success, including both courses transformed by faculty in the workshops and subsequent courses taken by the students. <br/><br/>The project intends to research: (1) changes to teaching practice that faculty make as a result of the professional development program, (2) faculty perceptions of the impact of changes made, and (3) the impact of these changes on student engagement, sense of belonging, and success outcomes. Analysis of faculty practices and perceptions will triangulate across multiple data streams collected longitudinally, including classroom observations, textual analysis of teaching artifacts, interviews with faculty about their pedagogical knowledge and decisions, and faculty surveys of their teaching practices. Student data will include performance on course assignments, reflections on course activities, and biometric sensor data taken during class to measure students' engagement. This project plans to include 30 STEM instructors in five departments (geosciences, chemistry, mathematics & statistics, physics, and biology), and to inform departmental and college policies on the implementation and value of faculty development for research-based instructional practices.

For example, the individual parts of a car are relatively simple, but assemble into a complex and powerful machine; sectional images from MRI can be used to reconstruct a picture of the human body that carries enough information to diagnose medical problems.  Studying objects as the amalgam of simpler pieces has great utility in mathematics.  This project concerns complicated spaces that can be built out of simpler ones, namely surfaces, like the surface of a ball or a doughnut (as well as more complicated surfaces).  The instructions for assembling the pieces are described by a mathematical object called the mapping class group, which carries all the information necessary to build certain spaces from surfaces.  The PI will work with a team of PhD students, postdocs, and colleagues and investigate the kinds of spaces that can be built from surfaces, and their geometric, algebraic, and analytic features.<br/><br/>This project involves the study of surfaces of finite and infinite type, their mapping class groups, and geometric features of manifolds and bundles we can understand from these.  The PI, together with his students, postdocs, and collaborators, will focus on the following themes:  (1) Convex cocompact and geometrically finite subgroups of the mapping class group for finite type surfaces and the geometry of the associated extension groups/surface bundles. (2) The hyperbolic geometry of depth-one foliations via mapping tori of end-periodic homeomorphism. (3) The geometric group theory of ``medium size? mapping class groups naturally containing end-periodic homeomorphisms. (4) Relations amongst pseudo-Anosov monodromies for fibered classes in a fixed hyperbolic 3-manifold. (5) Decoding geometry of billiard tables from the symbolic coding of its billiard flow.

This warmer, drier climate has triggered important changes to regional wildfire, pests and pathogen outbreaks, and permafrost thaw. The Bonanza Creek Long-Term Ecological Research (BNZ LTER) program will advance understanding of the impacts of changing climate and disturbance regimes on the Alaskan boreal forest and explore associated regional consequences on feedbacks to the climate system.  In collaboration with Alaska Native communities, as well as state and federal land management agencies, the BNZ LTER program will identify vulnerabilities and explore adaptation opportunities to environmental change. The program will increase understanding of ecological theory and the role of the boreal biome and permafrost soils in the Earth System. The BNZ LTER will share results with a broader community via outreach to students and educators through their schoolyard LTER and fostering science programs for undergraduate students, first-generation college students, and the general public. A new Alaska Native Advisory Council, which will bring a dynamic and inclusive Alaska Native perspective into the BNZ program will be introduced with this renewal.<br/>This research program will focus on ecological legacies of past ecosystems transmitted through carryover of information and materials that support ecosystem recovery and stabilization. Changes in climate or disturbance regimes can modify key legacies and trigger rapid ecosystem reorganization into new recovery trajectories. These include shifts to new states that are unlikely to recover to the pre-disturbance ecosystem. Such shifts in the frequency and longevity of ecosystem states can restructure processes at the landscape scale. They can influence soil thermal states, hydrology, species composition and biotic interactions, biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem services, and dynamics of social-ecological systems. The BNZ LTER program addresses the following questions: 1) how do legacies constrain the response of the Alaskan boreal forest to climate change, 2) how will these legacies affect future ecosystem trajectories, and 3) what are the local, regional, and global impacts of these emergent ecosystem trajectories now and in the future? Multiple mechanistic hypotheses about the role of legacies in ecosystem resilience and change will be tested using data from the site. Collection of long-term data will be continued and combined with data from new sites, experiments, and surveys. This will expand research to investigate new types of disturbance impacts. Statistical and process-based simulation models will be combined to predict current and future ecological dynamics and feedbacks at the landscape scale. It will identify social-ecological vulnerabilities and explore adaptation opportunities with Alaska Natives and Alaskan communities. <br/>This Long Term Ecological Research site is supported by The Division of Environmental Biology and the Office of Polar Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ripples in the fabric of space and time are produced when the densest objects in the Universe -- such as black holes and neutron stars -- orbit and collide. The detection of gravitational waves by the NSF-funded LIGO and European Virgo collaborations has opened up a new window on the Universe, revealing previously invisible events like pairs of black holes merging. Researchers supported by this award will participate in the analysis of gravitational waves as members of the LIGO collaboration, helping to infer the properties of the sources of these ripples. In addition to these collaboration activities, which have far-reaching impacts on astrophysics, cosmology, and nuclear physics, the research group will carry out searches for new physics using gravitational-wave data. Detections of gravitational waves provide information about spacetime at its most dynamic, allowing for strong-field tests of relativity, as the possibility of detecting extremely compact objects which are otherwise invisible to electromagnetic observations. This award will enable both searches for gravitational waves from new, hypothetical compact stars, and study how the final ""ringdown"" of merged black holes can be used to search for new physics. These research activities will provide training for graduate students in modeling and data analysis, skillsets which are in great demand and of great benefit to society. In addition, members of the group will engage in outreach activities in order to educate and inspire the public about this new field of physics and astronomy.<br/><br/>In particular, this project focuses supporting the LIGO Scientific Collaboration by performing Bayesian parameter estimation on detections made in the collaboration's next observing campaign. The PI and other members of the group will participate in the application of parameter estimation pipelines, carrying out inferences on detections made in low latency and helping to plan and execute comprehensive parameter analysis on longer timescales. These inferences are a crucial first step in the use of gravitational waves for understanding the populations of compact objects, inferring the nuclear equation of state from observations of binary neutron stars, testing the theory of relativity, and using gravitational waves to measure cosmic expansion. This project will also involve the investigation of systematic errors in parameter estimation when using cutting edge models, which exhibit complicated parameter degeneracies. The team will also use methods borrowed from quantum mechanical perturbation theory to predict how possible deviations from relativity are imprinted on the ringdown spectrum of spinning black holes. These predictions can be used in the future with Bayesian parameter estimation to constrain or measure the underlying parameters of these models using ringdown signals from binary black hole mergers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This census has identified never before seen systems and physics, challenging theories about how these objects form while enabling transformative multi-messenger science.  The hundreds of binary systems that will be detected during LIGO's next observing run provide unique opportunities but also challenges. This award supports ongoing work to enhance this census, focusing on disentangling signatures of new populations and new astrophysics.  More broadly, it supports the team's ongoing contributions to mission-critical tasks and publications of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.  <br/><br/>The RIT group's contributions will focus on interpreting sources both in isolation and collectively as part of the census, parameter and population inference.   In one major thrust, the group will focus on enhancing and operating two existing pieces of cyberinfrastructure, parameter and population inference codes RIFT and PopModels, respectively.   These improvements will enhance the capability to perform rapid and low-cost source and population parameter inference, targeting exceptional events and previously unidentified astrophysical phenomena.  In parallel, the group will assess pertinent astrophysical models for several of the most tantalizing candidates for near-term discovery, emphasizing opportunities enabled by low-mass or eccentric binaries. The award will benefit from strong synergies at the RIT Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation through its core scientific objectives, where the team benefits from deep expertise from other federally supported initiatives in relativistic astrophysics.   The award will support training of the STEM workforce, including underrepresented groups, as well as initiatives with REU and high-school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This mismatch diminishes the quality of science and management provided; many coastal professionals lack the lived experiences and knowledge to prioritize issues most impactful to people in coastal areas. Despite widespread recognition that increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is essential to sustaining the nation's capacity for innovation and discovery, there is a widening gap between the total number of marine science graduate degrees granted and degrees granted to those underrepresented in the field. Professional societies play a unique role in facilitating culture change within STEM disciplines by establishing and reinforcing norms and practices that advance greater diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and accessibility (DEIJA). They are also important avenues for training students and professionals in relevant skills and in developing networks necessary to progress in their careers. Culture change in professional societies scales up to impacts on members, their home institutions, and beyond. The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) will assist the next generation of coastal and estuarine biologists and related disciplines in navigating the current culture while simultaneously dismantling inequities at the root of low DEIJA in the disciplines through the Changing the Culture of our Occupations to Achieve Systemic Transformation (C-COAST) program, which will provide professional development, mentoring, and networking to students and professionals at all career stages.<br/><br/>The C-COAST program will harness evidence-based strategies to mitigate inequities and shift culture in the coastal and estuarine sciences through two programs: Rising TIDES Conference Program (RTCP) and Leadership Development Program (LDP). The RTCP is geared towards recruiting and retaining a new generation of estuarine and coastal science professionals. It consists of a 16-month program that supports attendance at the CERF and two additional coastal and estuarine conferences, with virtual meetings in between. The program provides professional and near-peer mentors, training, and networking, in addition to the full suite of scientific conference offerings. The LDP will provide leadership and DEIJA training for current and future leaders by building a dynamic learning community that will prepare emerging leaders to become agents of change while helping current leaders use existing power to address systemic inequities. The goals of C-COAST, from short- to long-term, are to 1): recruit and retain diverse undergraduate and graduate students and provide them professional development, mentorship, and peer networks to support a sense of belonging and identity; 2) educate current leaders on how to be more inclusive and change policies and practices that lead to inequities; and 3) increase the leadership skills of and opportunities for future leaders and prepare them to make policies and practices of CERF and their home institutions more inclusive when they are elevated to positions of power.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rapid growth of the RM is the result of a large-scale inventory program focused on documenting the flora of the Rocky Mountains. This project will provide for greatly increased accessibility of RM specimens and associated data, that are used for research, teaching, and outreach.  More than 200 herbarium cabinets will be added to secure over 420,000 specimens and allow for incorporation of the Central Wyoming College Herbarium.   A key activity will be to image all mounted specimens that have not yet been imaged, resulting in a total 700,000 completely digitized specimens that will substantially increase accessibility of collections data from Wyoming and the Rocky Mountains that are widely used by the public and land management agencies.

Examples include hypersonic vehicles and active impact mitigation strategies. The advanced operation of these mechanisms can only be achieved through control and feedback systems capable of operating in the sub-millisecond range, thus necessitating tight performance constraints. Additionally, high-rate systems are highly nonlinear and nonstationary, for which traditional real-time inference methods are incapable of providing credible predictions. Topological data analysis is gaining popularity for classifying complex time series. Its integration with architected machine learning algorithms shows promise in advancing the predictive capabilities for high-rate systems. However, topological data analysis is computationally expensive and cannot be applied in the sub-millisecond range. This project will investigate real-time topological data analysis capabilities by developing and integrating advances in mathematical, software, and hardware foundations. Successful completion of this project will yield theoretical foundations enabling the integration of topological data analysis with machine learning for modeling and forecasting time series, constituting a major leap from the pure algebraic topological approach. It is envisioned that the developed foundations, along with software and hardware artifacts, will find applications in supercomputing, high-speed data storage, connected vehicles, financial fraud mitigation, cyber-security, deep-fake detection, active blast shielding, and hypersonic vehicles. This project will broaden participation in computing by training multiple undergraduate and graduate students through a well-structured research and education plan that leverages existing programs and partnerships at the three partnering universities, including an undergraduate historically black college.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate that complex nonstationary systems can be learned in real-time by integrating modern mathematical tools combined with advances in hardware, notably by generating a field-programmable gate array design for a real-time predictor running on the edge. To that end, customized variations of traditional topological data analysis will be developed to meet the needs of the targeted modeling and forecasting tasks while producing computationally efficient machine learning representations. Concurrently, opportunities and limitations in conducting topological data analysis in real-time and in producing a modular automated programmer for heterogeneous hardware will be identified. Then, software and hardware discoveries will be integrated to demonstrate real-time topological data analysis and to conduct time series modeling and forecasting.

This is done by packaging the cells in a scaffold, which is encapsulated in a semi-permeable isolating membrane. The packaged cells are connected to the host?s vasculature via a tube (anastomosis graft) transporting oxygen and nutrients rich blood to the cells. The semi-permeable encapsulating membrane, located at the interface between the blood flow in the graft and the cell scaffold, is designed to block the host?s immune cells from attacking the transplanted cells, while allowing passage of oxygen and nutrients to the cells. A major challenge in cell encapsulation is sufficient oxygen and nutrients supply to maintain the long-term viability of cells. The main goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive multi-scale and multi-physics mathematical and computational framework modeling cell encapsulation. Using this framework, The PIs will address the long-term viability of encapsulated cells by (1) studying how hydrogel architecture and elasticity affect oxygen and nutrients supply to the cells, and by (2) exploring design of ultrafiltrate channels within the hydrogel to maximize oxygen and nutrients supply to the cells. The concept of cell encapsulation is highly relevant for bioartificial organs design and for controlled delivery of biological therapeutics. This interdisciplinary project will provide mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students at the interface between mathematics and biology. A new graduate course at Texas Tech will be introduced to train students in the state-or-the-art mathematical methods developed in this project.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive multi-scale, multi-physics mathematical and computational model of cell encapsulation for bioartificial organs design. At the macro-scale, two sets of time-dependent coupled models will be developed and analyzed: (1) a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model between the Stokes/Navier-Stokes equations and the Biot membrane equations coupled to the nonlinear Biot poroelastic medium equations, and (2) a set of coupled nonlinear advection-reaction-diffusion equations defined on moving domains describing oxygen concentration in the encapsulated organ. Two partitioned schemes will be developed to solve the FSI problem and the coupled advection-reaction-diffusion problems. The numerical schemes will be designed to deal with the novel coupling conditions holding across a Biot poroelastic membrane interface, defined on a ?mixed?? 2D/3D domain. Stability analysis and convergence tests will be performed. To capture the impact of micro-scale hydrogel architecture on local hydraulic conductivity, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations will be used. The results of the SPH simulations will provide synthetic data for the Encoder-Decoder Convolution Neural Networks training (offline) to produce macro-scale parameters, such as the hydrogel permeability tensor, needed in macro-scale simulations. Validation and parameter estimation will be provided by the experiments at the UCSF Biodesign Laboratory. The results from this research will advance the knowledge in mathematical FSI involving poroelastic media and in coupled nonlinear advection-reaction-diffusion systems on moving domains.

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.).

The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries.  The teams will establish transdisciplinary projects to identify and understand how climate-related events, both slow and rapid onset, are linked to human migration and mobility.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop a predictive model of climate-induced migration based in theory and informed by spatially explicit data to better understand the climate-migration nexus. Importantly, the project examines how climate migration intersects with other hardships from conflicts to poverty and epidemics. The project will use cell phone data to provide real-time data on migration within a given country, something that is often not captured by global datasets. High resolution mobility patterns will be examined by leveraging satellite, social media, survey, and statistical data. These analyses will inform a framework to estimate the likelihood of displacement within country (using Senegal as a case study) and map locations of ?climate shocks.? These mapping exercises will be complemented by social media data and on-the-ground surveys, to understand the public opinion and discourse around climate migration. Building off the case study, the research team plans to build a predictive model using Big Data sources in concert with simulated future scenarios, to help inform public policy.  The CLIMB project team is multinational and multi-institutional and includes members who bring expertise from ecology, earth sciences, data sciences, sociology, and economics, representing five countries (Sweden, Turkey, Senegal, Austria, and USA).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The value of the facility is based on its location, well above the Arctic circle, high enough in elevation to be in the free troposphere, not influenced by human settlements or the moderating effects of the ocean, and the site of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) deep ice core. Summit StationT hosts the Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit), the only NSF site with permission from the Government of Greenland to provide long-term environmental measurements. Summit Station is staffed year-round and fills an important niche in the international scientific community?s global measurement capability. The Science Coordination Office (SCO) for Summit Station represents research interests that utilize the station, providing regular feedback to the managers of the Arctic Research Support and Logistics Program (RSL) and conveying information back to the research community about NSF?s plans for the station. The SCO presents the needs and desires of the science community working on the ice sheet in interior Greenland in discussions and decision making process between RSL and their primary logistics support contractor. NSF has stated plans to recapitalize the infrastructure at Summit Station and the SCO will ensure there is communication with the research community throughout the planning and design process. The SCO concurs with NSF?s goals to make a safe and sustainable Summit Station elevated above the drifting snow and preserving the clean air and clean snow research areas. The GEOSummit website has resources for new Principal Investigators, students and educators.<br/><br/>Summit Station, Greenland is the site of decades of study of deep ice cores, atmospheric chemistry, snow processes and, more recently, the study of high-energy neutrinos from the origins of the universe. Through this effort, the SCO will ensure that plans to operate and in coming years to recapitalize the infrastructure at Summit Station will be done with the interests of the research community. The SCO meets weekly with the arctic logistics contractor science support, logistics and operations at Summit Station to remain informed about plans and communicate research interests. The SCO is invited to review documents and provide input on plans for Summit Station. SCO will continue to advocate for Summit Station site plans that accommodate an influx of astrophysical research while maintaining long standing focus on research that needs clean air and snow conditions. The SCO helps prevent research projects from inadvertently interfering with each other. The SCO website is a keystone of communication to the science community, with several features added over the past few years such as the Google Earth based GIS, a virtual tour using Streetview images, a new Working at Summit section targeting new investigators, news from the station and a comprehensive bibliography of published work near Summit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graphs have been commonly used to represent the structure and content of these systems for event prediction and risk estimation. To date, many graph learning methods, such as graph neural networks, have been proposed, but primarily for static graphs. In dynamic systems, the structure and content are simultaneously evolving in response to emerging trends and events, making it difficult to understand and interpret how each part of the graph functions in forming reliable models for predictions. This project strives to build a graph learning and interpretation framework for dynamic systems by combining sensor pattern discovery, node interaction and network functionality analysis, and physics- and knowledge-informed learning. The project will propose new algorithms for modeling and understanding large-scale dynamic systems using graphs, as well as develop a prototype for domain experts to analyze their data, explain what is currently happening in the system, understand the resulting consequences, and provide possible mitigation strategies.  The joint effort between the US and Australian teams will help understand/uncover the dynamics of water monitoring systems for different terrain types, inland and coastal water exchange, toxic algal blooms, and resilience of rural and regional communities.<br/><br/>The project includes three main thrusts: (1) sensor signal to feature extraction and understanding; (2) dynamic network node modeling and interpretation; and (3) dynamic network functionality and trustworthiness. The research will study signal snippet pattern (SSP) extraction and interaction analysis to understand how features interact with each other during the emergence of significant events. At the node level, new temporal encoding and spatial-temporal graph neural networks will be used to learn models for node event prediction and anomaly detection for early warning. The study of node interaction will answer why, when, and how two nodes may be interacting with each other. Beyond node level interpretation, the project will target graph functional units, estimate each snapshot graph?s contribution, and locate subgraphs with the highest significance concerning output systems. A perturbation-based post-hoc explainer will provide counterfactual explanations to enhance the explainability and trustworthiness of dynamic graph neural network systems. The research will also investigate combining physics laws and domain knowledge into dynamic graph neural networks to develop a data-efficient, robust, and responsible graph modeling framework. <br/><br/>This is a joint project between U.S. and Australian researchers funded by the Collaboration Opportunities in Responsible and Equitable AI under the U.S. NSF and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is home to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the fastest ocean current on Earth. As a strong carbon sink, it represents an important shield against some of the effects of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. However, the processes driving the Southern Ocean?s variability are still poorly known. This project will investigate the role of the South Pacific in the climate system over the past 2 million years. It will do so using sediment cores recovered during a recent drilling expedition on the Joides Resolution. The project will generate records of surface ocean conditions that can inform our understanding of the capacity of the ocean to take up carbon dioxide and store it in the deep ocean. The geosciences are the STEM field with the least participation from underrepresented minorities. The project will use a cohort student program to actively promote diversity and broadened participation. Under the guidance of a psychology professor, the project will create an environment that enhances engagement, learning and innovation through diversity. A goal of this cohort approach is to shift geoscience education from a style based on gatekeeping to one that that is inviting and supportive of people from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The climate science community?s understanding of Earth?s long-term climate evolution predominantly comes from Northern Hemisphere climate records. Given the central role of the Southern Ocean in the global climate system and its proximity to the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Southern Hemisphere data gap severely inhibits our ability to understand global changes in ocean-atmosphere-ice sheet dynamics and carbon cycling during major climatic transitions. Records from the South Pacific are especially valuable to improve our understanding of these processes, because the Pacific contains by far the largest surface area and volume fraction of the Southern Ocean and therefore holds the largest capacity for carbon storage in the deep ocean. This project proposes to generate high-resolution climate proxy time series over the past 2 million years with emphasis across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) using new sediment cores recovered during Expedition 383. These long records will explore changes in climate/carbon dynamics at the ocean surface by reconstructing dust input, nutrient utilization, and export production and these records will be synthesized and interpreted with collaborators? records of sea surface temperature, water mass structure and circulation. Drawing from expertise across three US institutions, the project will produce an unprecedented suite of complementary biological and geochemical tracers at three drill sites (U1539, U1540, and U1541) in the Subantarctic Pacific.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tactile graphics are considered to be critical for teaching spatially structured information like maps, geometry, and mathematical equations. However, dynamic tactile graphic displays today are often prohibitively expensive. The low cost and compactness of this technology could drastically change the availability of tactile graphic displays as well as refreshable Braille. Miniature hydraulic actuation is a foundational technology that has broad potential in other markets, such as soft robotics, wearable devices, prostheses, and other medical devices. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of created miniature arrays of actuators which can produce the relevant pressures and deformations for haptic feedback. The individual actuators are electrically driven, individually addressable, compact, and dynamic. Additionally, the arrays are low cost, lightweight, and they scale favorably for large numbers of actuators. This effectively enables a new type of display that is capable of conveying detailed tactile ?images? of shapes and edges across an area of skin. These innovations will be incorporated as<br/>tactile displays into haptic gloves to enable the sense of touch in augmented and virtual reality environments. The skin is a distributed sensory organ with over 250,000 tactile afferent fibers spread across the external surface of the body, and it is like the retina in its ability to sense across space. As the skin is stretched, compressed, and vibrated at different points, higher level objects are recognized, such as<br/>keys in your pocket. This type of nuanced, high volume tactile information transfer happens constantly and without effort in daily actions. An immense amount of knowledge can be contained in the sense of touch, such as the pattern of a surgeon?s suture, or the orientation and location of an object within a robot?s grip, yet it is hard to communicate. A dynamic tactile display allows this knowledge to be presented and is a fundamental piece of technology for the sense of touch, enabling additional research and commercial effort. While visual displays have reached the limits of the retina, the most complex haptic feedback that most people encounter is the buzz of a smartphone or click of a trackpad. This project will explore haptic gloves for robotic teleoperation tasks, and from simulation companies for emergency response training, and medical education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The next generation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) instruments will reveal much about the origin and evolution of the Universe, about the fundamental physics driving its birth and growth, and about its dynamic contents as they interact and change.  Achieving these goals requires a significant improvement both in instrumental capabilities and in data pipelines.  Building on significant investment by the Simons Foundation (SF) in the Simons Observatory (SO), this award provides three Advanced SO (ASO) deliverables, which will increase the scientific reach, increase access to the wider community not expert in the instrumentation, and decrease the environmental impact of the facility and improve relations with the host country of Chile.  There are extensive plans for public outreach and the training of early career researchers during the survey activity once ASO is operational.  Meanwhile, implementation of the infrastructure involves more than a dozen graduate students and around ten postdocs, as key players.  There will be opportunities for young physicists to work with SO scientists on summer activities, and extensive training on the ASO infrastructure, mentored by SO scientists in a collaboration with the Simons Foundation and the National Society of Black Physicists.<br/><br/>The contributions from this award are: (i) 30,000 new detectors and associated optics for the SO six-meter diameter Large Aperture Telescope, doubling its mapping speed and enabling the detection of transient objects; (ii) an end-to-end data pipeline to produce and validate maps of all SO data, and generate daily light-curves of variable sources concurrent with other surveys such as those from the Rubin Observatory, and (iii) a photovoltaic power system that directly increases system sensitivity while reducing operating costs and environmental impact.  This infrastructure is crucial to the survey goal, to produce millimeter-wave maps of the sky on a regular cadence.  Such maps are a critical part of the search for primordial gravitational waves, but also help understanding of galaxy evolution and the role of magnetic fields.  Analysis will: (1) reveal physical conditions in the early universe and constrain any new light particles; (2) measure the distribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the more recent universe, and combine with large-scale structure surveys to determine the neutrino mass and the effects of dark energy; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and pressure around galaxy groups and clusters; (4) use the thermal Sunyaev-Zel?dovich effect to find more than 30,000 galaxy clusters and more than 100,000 extragalactic millimeter sources; (5) measure the alignment of dust by magnetic fields in our Galaxy; and (6) reveal new features of the transient universe concurrent with optical observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is home to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the fastest ocean current on Earth. As a strong carbon sink, it represents an important shield against some of the effects of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. However, the processes driving the Southern Ocean?s variability are still poorly known. This project will investigate the role of the South Pacific in the climate system over the past 2 million years. It will do so using sediment cores recovered during a recent drilling expedition on the Joides Resolution. The project will generate records of surface ocean conditions that can inform our understanding of the capacity of the ocean to take up carbon dioxide and store it in the deep ocean. The geosciences are the STEM field with the least participation from underrepresented minorities. The project will use a cohort student program to actively promote diversity and broadened participation. Under the guidance of a psychology professor, the project will create an environment that enhances engagement, learning and innovation through diversity. A goal of this cohort approach is to shift geoscience education from a style based on gatekeeping to one that that is inviting and supportive of people from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The climate science community?s understanding of Earth?s long-term climate evolution predominantly comes from Northern Hemisphere climate records. Given the central role of the Southern Ocean in the global climate system and its proximity to the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Southern Hemisphere data gap severely inhibits our ability to understand global changes in ocean-atmosphere-ice sheet dynamics and carbon cycling during major climatic transitions. Records from the South Pacific are especially valuable to improve our understanding of these processes, because the Pacific contains by far the largest surface area and volume fraction of the Southern Ocean and therefore holds the largest capacity for carbon storage in the deep ocean. This project proposes to generate high-resolution climate proxy time series over the past 2 million years with emphasis across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) using new sediment cores recovered during Expedition 383. These long records will explore changes in climate/carbon dynamics at the ocean surface by reconstructing dust input, nutrient utilization, and export production and these records will be synthesized and interpreted with collaborators? records of sea surface temperature, water mass structure and circulation. Drawing from expertise across three US institutions, the project will produce an unprecedented suite of complementary biological and geochemical tracers at three drill sites (U1539, U1540, and U1541) in the Subantarctic Pacific.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its production, however, comes at a steep price for the environment. Steelmaking accounts for 7-11% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. Facing escalating pressure from governments and investors to reduce emissions, the steel industry is experimenting with green steel projects that reduce greenhouse emissions by using hydrogen instead of traditional carbon-intensive manufacturing.  However, fundamental understanding of the chemical processes that transform Iron oxide into Iron by use of hydrogen is required before green steel technology can advance. This process is called hydrogen-based direct reduction. This project uses highly advanced techniques to understand hydrogen-based direct reduction by acquiring never before seen observations of the chemical reaction at the level of atoms along various points throughout time. This project combines these atomistically resolved experiments with computation in tightly integrated feedback loops, to achieve new real-time observations which vary both spatially and temporally. As part of this research program, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels are learning and using new microscopy, spectroscopy, kinetic measurement and modeling techniques to work on materials issues that are at the forefront of current energy and environmental research. Results from this project are also being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses as well as high school outreach programs.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT	<br/>Although oxide reduction plays a crucial role in many technologically important processes, a significant portion of current knowledge is based upon work at the mesoscale that is too coarse to reflect underlying microscopic details. This project addresses this knowledge gap by elucidating the atomistic mechanisms underlying the hierarchical interplay of oxide reduction pathways. By employing a unique combination of in situ experiments and coordinated theoretical modeling, this project elucidates i) the elemental steps of H2 adsorption leading to the onset of oxide reduction; ii) microscopic mechanisms governing the propagation of oxide reduction and microstructure evolution via multi-interfacial transformations; and iii) atomistic processes leading to reversible oxidation-reduction cycles due to the countering action of H2 and gaseous product H2O. Clearly addressing these questions provide essential insights into reaction active sites, transient states, mass transport mechanisms, reaction activation energies and reaction pathways. The study identifies critical structural and chemical parameters for controlling the efficiency, kinetics and metallic yield, which are leading to more efficient H2-based direct reduction methods, with potentially high impact on the urgently needed decarbonization of the steel industry. The sum of experimental and theoretical efforts also provide fundamental knowledge for construction of predictive and hierarchical multi-scale models of oxide reduction that naturally link different reaction stages, relate the atomistic processes with the macroscale behavior, and open the door to tailoring gas-solid reactions via controlling underlying atomic processes. Such fundamental insights are shedding light on other fields such as corrosion, electrochemistry and catalysis, where the prototypes of basic processes also occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The value of the facility is based on its location, well above the Arctic circle, high enough in elevation to be in the free troposphere, not influenced by human settlements or the moderating effects of the ocean, and the site of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) deep ice core. Summit StationT hosts the Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit), the only NSF site with permission from the Government of Greenland to provide long-term environmental measurements. Summit Station is staffed year-round and fills an important niche in the international scientific community?s global measurement capability. The Science Coordination Office (SCO) for Summit Station represents research interests that utilize the station, providing regular feedback to the managers of the Arctic Research Support and Logistics Program (RSL) and conveying information back to the research community about NSF?s plans for the station. The SCO presents the needs and desires of the science community working on the ice sheet in interior Greenland in discussions and decision making process between RSL and their primary logistics support contractor. NSF has stated plans to recapitalize the infrastructure at Summit Station and the SCO will ensure there is communication with the research community throughout the planning and design process. The SCO concurs with NSF?s goals to make a safe and sustainable Summit Station elevated above the drifting snow and preserving the clean air and clean snow research areas. The GEOSummit website has resources for new Principal Investigators, students and educators.<br/><br/>Summit Station, Greenland is the site of decades of study of deep ice cores, atmospheric chemistry, snow processes and, more recently, the study of high-energy neutrinos from the origins of the universe.

The importance of social touch is becoming more evident as we increase remote communication through email, text messages and videoconferencing. Prior work has shown that social touch can be replicated through wearable and holdable devices, but current devices are bulky and impractical. This research will combine principles of soft robotics and knit textiles of varying stiffness to design and fabricate a new kind of soft wearable haptic device, in which careful specification of stitch size, placement, and material in a knit sleeve will control the deformation of pneumatic bladders that apply force to the wearer. Project outcomes will advance knowledge in the field of social touch and human perception, and will lay the foundation for a variety of other types of knit-textile-based devices, including soft assistive devices. Additional broad impact will derive from activities designed to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through lab tours, outreach programs, and mentoring of students from groups that are underrepresented in engineering, and by making project findings available to a wide audience through an open-source materials library.<br/><br/>Current soft wearable devices are bulky and impractical because they need stiff frames to ensure load transmission. The pixel-like control of material properties afforded by multi-material and multi-stitch knit textiles, on the other hand, can redirect force transmission to precise deformation modes efficiently and with a low profile. This project approaches designing, fabricating, and testing knit-enabled wearable devices in three thrusts. The first thrust will model and optimize knits to achieve target load and deformation profiles by using a combination of experimental material characterization and multiscale modeling to harness the full capabilities of the modern knitting process. The second thrust will design, fabricate, and test wearable pneumatic devices, including consideration for donning and doffing, actuator integration and interfacing, and device characterization. The third thrust will implement and test social touch cues using the device with pre-programmed haptic emojis and display of teleoperated social touch queues in real time.

It is anticipated that customized chips to be integrated into a broad array of application areas such as aerospace, pharmaceutical and multi-physics systems with a need for real-time and predictive control.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of application-specific microprocessors including a robust programming framework. The proposed technology addresses the development of relevant algorithms to analyze the computational behavior of targeted software applications. The application-specific microprocessors developed for this project will focus primarily on accelerating the numerical solution of differential equations.  Differential equations form the mathematical basis for many computational dynamics systems, and it is important to solve them in a rapid and efficient manner. The popularization of open-source instruction set architectures has enabled new microprocessor design while the advancement of field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology has enabled rapid prototyping and evaluation. The intersection of these developments has facilitated development of target application-specific microprocessor designs at low cost.  Initial results have shown that the designed hardware accelerator attains up to 4.8x speedup, at the cost of merely 13.3% more hardware resources and 8.1% additional power dissipation.

Single-layer strontium ruthenate (SRO) had been a leading candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor up to 2019. However, it turned out that one of the experiments that supported that claim in SRO is incorrect. This led to a controversy on the nature of superconductivity in this material.

Single-layer strontium ruthenate (SRO) was considered a leading candidate for spin-triplet superconductivity up to 2019 when results from an important NMR Knight shift experiment from 1998, which probes the spin part of the order parameter, was shown to be incorrect. This led to suggestions by some researchers that SRO is actually a spin singlet. On the other hand, the Josephson effect based phase-sensitive experiments on SRO, which have remained largely unchallenged, suggest that the orbital part of the order parameter in SRO is of an odd parity, which implies that SRO is a spin triplet due to the presence of an inversion symmetry in this material. The heated debate on the pairing symmetry in SRO calls for new theoretical insights and additional experimental inputs. This project aims to strengthen the previous determination of the odd parity order parameter in SRO as well as identify ways to reconcile this with work probing the spin degrees of freedom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Why certain individuals perform better under high stress than others with similar training remains unexplored. Resilience, the ability to maintain performance during stressful events, is a crucial attribute of healthy individuals who work in such environments. Because resilience has important implications for human well-being and task performance, there is a need to identify healthy individuals who are vulnerable to stress-related performance decline, preferably prior to actual performance under stress, to facilitate delivery of focused intervention that might help prevent the development of clinical stress disorders that pose a tremendous burden both for the individual and for society in general. This project will fundamentally advance our understanding of stress resilience by addressing the limitations of existing stress resilience measures and identifying potential biomarkers of stress resilience. Project outcomes will contribute to the assessment of the capabilities of healthy individuals who must maintain performance in the face of escalating cognitive demands such as emergency room personnel and first responders, prediction of their expected variation over time, and applicant suitability of recruitment for occupations within challenging operating environments.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to identify neural signatures, and to develop predictive models of task performance using neurophysiological features of dynamic resilience.

Combining both EEG and fNIRS has great potential to provide deeper insight into stress resilience than either modality could alone. The dynamic functional connectivity approach employed in this study will likely provide insight into neural processes underlying resilience, while the dynamic network measures identified may serve as potential biomarkers for stress resilience. This project will not only enhance scientific knowledge on the relationship between temporal dynamics of resilience and neural adaptations but will also provide novel dynamic resilience biomarkers that may be used to determine the limits of human performance in high-stakes occupational settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To curb and ultimately reverse climate change governments, organizations, and citizens around the world are taking actions to reduce the carbon footprint of human activity. Achieving these goals requires the effective creation and implementation of climate interventions, ranging from the individual to the national level. Yet developing effective climate change policies poses a significant challenge. Numerous policy options are possible, and policies interact with one another in unexpected ways. The task is further complicated by the fact that there are many sources of information about climate change, but they are often laden with jargon and may conflict with one another. The goal of this project is to develop responsible artificial intelligence (AI) to help stakeholders make sense of climate change related information, so that non-experts can collectively make sense of and implement effective policies. This encompasses a wide variety of possible AI-assisted tasks, ranging from summarizing the latest news reports to explaining the outcome of new legislation. <br/><br/>In particular, we will focus on improving policymaking and public awareness by bridging the information gap between a wealth of publicly available information and a dearth of actionable insights. This will ultimately improve the effectiveness of climate change policies. The technical aims are structured along three thrusts: 1) understanding which tasks users are willing to delegate to AI and why; 2) developing a large-scale dataset of climate change related information, ranging from legislative texts from Australia and the US to news articles and social media; and 3) developing prototypes of AI systems to demonstrate the promise of responsible AI in promoting effective climate change policies.<br/><br/>This is a joint project between U.S. and Australian researchers funded by the Collaboration Opportunities in Responsible and Equitable AI under the U.S. NSF and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of social touch is becoming more evident as we increase remote communication through email, text messages and videoconferencing. Prior work has shown that social touch can be replicated through wearable and holdable devices, but current devices are bulky and impractical. This research will combine principles of soft robotics and knit textiles of varying stiffness to design and fabricate a new kind of soft wearable haptic device, in which careful specification of stitch size, placement, and material in a knit sleeve will control the deformation of pneumatic bladders that apply force to the wearer. Project outcomes will advance knowledge in the field of social touch and human perception, and will lay the foundation for a variety of other types of knit-textile-based devices, including soft assistive devices. Additional broad impact will derive from activities designed to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering through lab tours, outreach programs, and mentoring of students from groups that are underrepresented in engineering, and by making project findings available to a wide audience through an open-source materials library.<br/><br/>Current soft wearable devices are bulky and impractical because they need stiff frames to ensure load transmission. The pixel-like control of material properties afforded by multi-material and multi-stitch knit textiles, on the other hand, can redirect force transmission to precise deformation modes efficiently and with a low profile. This project approaches designing, fabricating, and testing knit-enabled wearable devices in three thrusts. The first thrust will model and optimize knits to achieve target load and deformation profiles by using a combination of experimental material characterization and multiscale modeling to harness the full capabilities of the modern knitting process. The second thrust will design, fabricate, and test wearable pneumatic devices, including consideration for donning and doffing, actuator integration and interfacing, and device characterization. The third thrust will implement and test social touch cues using the device with pre-programmed haptic emojis and display of teleoperated social touch queues in real time. Taken together, these thrusts will create new forms of communication and lead to increased capabilities of wearable devices that improve human health and quality of life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Greenhouses can be a form of high productivity farming that conserves land and water making them an attractive form of sustainable and climate resilient agriculture. However, greenhouses consume significantly more energy than conventional farming. For greenhouses to be a part of a sustainable agriculture future, there is a need to reduce their energy demand. Prior research has demonstrated that organic solar modules integrated into greenhouse structures may reduce or even eliminate external energy demand while not negatively impacting crop production. The global commercial market of conventional greenhouses will reach $50.6 billion by 2025. The growing greenhouse market translates to gigawatt solar power market size. The added economic benefit of organic solar module adoption in greenhouses provides a path for widespread adoption of organic solar modules and the growing greenhouse market. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop flexible, semitransparent, organic solar cells that are tailored specifically for greenhouse glazing integration. The organic solar cells will contribute to the energy production of such greenhouses and may completely eliminate greenhouse energy needs, providing a more environmentally sound form of agriculture. To make this vision of low energy demand greenhouses, there is a need to make high-performance flexible organic solar cells. This solution will be achieved through the optimization of the active layer, the electrodes, and the encapsulation processes. The three primary research tasks are to: (1) produce photoactive inks that are compatible with large-scale coating and have tuned transmittance; (2) achieve high transparency and physically robust, transparent, conducting electrodes based on silver nanowires produced using scalable coating methods; and (3) develop large area, low-cost, transparent, and flexible encapsulation layers. If successful, these solar cells will have advantageous operating characteristics not achievable with other solar cell technologies, providing a unique commercial opportunity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Isomers are molecules with the same constituent atoms but arranged differently. The identification of isomers and their conformational forms is of critical importance to pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries since the metabolites of many medications or agrochemical compounds are often isomers of one another. Since some of these metabolites may be harmful, safety and efficacy studies require careful analytical ?method development? work to quantitate their presence in clinical samples, soils, and foodstuffs.  Unfortunately, current analytical methods for identifying molecular isomers are cumbersome, slow, and involve trial and error work ? presenting a significant bottleneck to regulatory approval.  The proposed technology seeks to provide a rapid and robust instrument for isomer analysis, dramatically reducing pharmaceutical and agrochemical development costs and extending patent exclusivity sales ? while enabling the experimental identification of conformers for the first time. Access to this new information has the potential to transform agrochemical ($220 billion total addressable market (TAM) in 2022) and drug discovery ($82 billion TAM 2022) sectors, while generating new well-paying, high-tech jobs.<br/>  <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel mass spectrometer that works on neutral molecules rather than ions.  It uses high electric fields to manipulate and distinguish molecules, separating them by the magnitude of their electrical polarity which, in turn, is highly sensitive to the molecule?s 3D shape.  Molecules may be pushed or pulled by the fields depending on their orientations in the field and the magnitude of their polarity (?dipole moment?).  Since molecular isomers weigh the same, their identification via mass spectrometry is complicated and typically requires time-consuming ?method development? work. The proposed instrument aims to reduce this work by using dipole moments to distinguish all isomers and their conformers in a single spectrum ? with an axis labeled by mass-to-dipole-moment ratio, rather than mass-to-charge ratio. This technology uses microfabrication techniques to miniaturize and planarize a previously demonstrated quadrupole device described in the academic literature, creating an array of microscopic quadrupole channels. The additional patent-pending deceleration feature, coupled with velocity selective detection, should result in 2-to-3 orders of magnitude higher isomer/conformer discrimination capabilities over the literature device. Finally, this universal detection methodology will allow for continuous throughput, which is ideal for interfacing with standard analytical instrumentation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CoMIC will develop a first-of-its-kind, open-accessible, and reconfigurable research infrastructure, which is naturally required by various use cases such as education, training, healthcare, and entertainment. It strives to offer a collaborative, visual-first, and hologram-based computing space and a QoE-driven, multi-site, and immersive communication framework by providing a shared environment for community users. CoMIC will be open to and support in-person visits of community users to facilitate their research projects. <br/><br/>This project will create broader impacts on research infrastructure, education and training, societies, and economies, and broaden computing participation. Currently, the research and development of multi-user XR have been hindered because the underlying infrastructure with essential building blocks is still missing.

The central technological innovation is to provide clinicians and their patients the capability to detect atypical walking force profiles, deploy precision biofeedback treatments to optimize joint health, and monitor gait to maintain healthy movement profiles. Lower extremity osteoarthritis is the 11th leading cause of global disability. In the US alone, individuals with OA spend nearly $4.8 billion more in out-of-pocket healthcare costs than those without osteoarthritis. There is no cure for osteoarthritis and rehabilitation options for preventing disease onset and/or mitigating progression remain critically limited. Proper gait biomechanics act to distribute forces across lower extremity joint surfaces and thereby preserve joint function and tissue health. Unfortunately, current clinical options are not capable of optimizing the lower extremity joint forces critical to maintain healthy joint tissues and prevent the development and slow the progression of osteoarthritis.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of technology with the ability to detect and modify aberrant forces during walking and positively influence joint mechanics and biology. Not detecting, treating, and monitoring aberrant gait biomechanics in osteoarthritis patients leads to potentially devastating health and financial consequences. To overcome these limitations, the team developed a low-cost and clinically-feasible <br/>wearable sensor-based system that leverages artificial intelligence and cloud computing to replace sophisticated research-grade equipment to detect, treat, and monitor aberrant lower extremity forces that lead to OA onset and progression.

This project aims to uncover the true diversity of phytoplasmas worldwide, reconstruct their evolutionary relationships, and document their associations with insects and plants by screening a large collection of insects preserved in a museum biorepository and modern DNA sequencing techniques. The new data will help identify hotspots of phytoplasma diversity worldwide, clarify the extent to which phytoplasmas have affected the evolution of their host plants and insect vectors, and contribute to training of a new generation of experts on phytoplasma ecology, epidemiology and evolution. Emergence of new plant diseases may be driven by environmental change (including climate change) that triggers the colonization of managed habitats (e.g., croplands) by previously unknown disease agents from adjacent natural areas. Improved knowledge on the overall phytoplasma diversity in natural areas will greatly facilitate efforts to predict and manage new disease outbreaks.<br/><br/>Specific goals of the project include: 1) screen insect specimens for presence of phytoplasmas using next-generation DNA-sequencing technology; 2) obtain partial phytoplasma genomes and host plant data for newly detected insect-associated phytoplasmas; 3) reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among all known phytoplasmas, classify newly discovered strains and estimate the times of origin of individual lineages;  4) update an existing online database to include all previously known and newly discovered phytoplasma-host associations; 5) cultivate new expertise by training and mentoring students in leading-edge methods for studying a diverse and poorly known lineage of agriculturally important microbes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These entities impose standards on their suppliers and shape consumer behavior - for good or bad. Sustainability behavior of supermarket chains differs considerably across sustainability dimensions, business models, and countries.  This project links the observed sustainability patterns to the business rationale of firms to understand why corporate sustainability profiles differ so strongly across retail corporations, to gain insight on corporate decision-making and to help explain strategic differences.  The project investigates decision-making through an innovative analytical framework integrating management science, value chain research, and socio-technical systems research and several methodological approaches including business management research, consumer behavioral economics, and environmental impact analysis.   This project will increase the knowledge of policymakers, civil society organizations, private sector associations, and consumer groups about what are the current actions, opportunities, and challenges for supermarket chains to increase the sustainability of their food products and services.

It is envisioned that the developed foundations, along with software and hardware artifacts, will find applications in supercomputing, high-speed data storage, connected vehicles, financial fraud mitigation, cyber-security, deep-fake detection, active blast shielding, and hypersonic vehicles. This project will broaden participation in computing by training multiple undergraduate and graduate students through a well-structured research and education plan that leverages existing programs and partnerships at the three partnering universities, including an undergraduate historically black college.<br/><br/>This project will demonstrate that complex nonstationary systems can be learned in real-time by integrating modern mathematical tools combined with advances in hardware, notably by generating a field-programmable gate array design for a real-time predictor running on the edge. To that end, customized variations of traditional topological data analysis will be developed to meet the needs of the targeted modeling and forecasting tasks while producing computationally efficient machine learning representations. Concurrently, opportunities and limitations in conducting topological data analysis in real-time and in producing a modular automated programmer for heterogeneous hardware will be identified. Then, software and hardware discoveries will be integrated to demonstrate real-time topological data analysis and to conduct time series modeling and forecasting. Undergraduate students involved in these research projects will be provided with long-term mentored research and learning experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, single-cell microbes are engineered to produce valuable metabolites using enzymes rather than sourcing these chemicals from petroleum. Developing genetically engineered cell strains with high yield remains an ongoing effort due to the complexities in how genetic code leads to phenotype expression. This problem is addressed using a bottom-up approach to screen microbe populations at the single-cell level. The method deployed to identify metabolite content in individual cells is based on infrared (IR)-absorption spectroscopy which is label-free, quantitative, and non-destructive.  Synthetic biology is poised to disrupt the chemical value-chain by providing an alternative to petroleum-based chemicals that is sustainable and carbon-neutral.  Once a highly productive cell is identified it can be selectively propagated to create enriched cell lines. Innovations in optical microscopy are required to improve the performance of the cell screening instruments, which will allow high-resolution focusing across a broad spectral range. The upgraded platform will optimize yield more quickly, providing value by reducing the upfront cost to develop new industrial cell strains. <br/><br/>The proposed project emphasizes optical engineering to develop a microscope designed for high-resolution chemical imaging based on molecular vibrational IR-absorptions. This is achieved by deploying focusing elements that operate over a broad spectral range that extend standard optical microscopes to include mid-infrared light sources. The optical instrument will be used to evaluate chemical content in industrial microbe strains and develop enriched cell lines. These single-cell microbe populations are engineered to produce enzymes used to catalyze the synthesis of valuable metabolites. Yields from individual cells, however, are variable due to genetic mutations in the population. Therefore, a quantitative analytical tool based on IR-spectroscopy that can non-destructively identify highly productive cells for selective propagation is extremely desirable. This bottom-up approach for metabolomic cell screening and directed evolution is an innovation as it is label-free, non-invasive, and has strong chemical specificity. In this project, the team will study an industrial microalgae strain used as a low-cost feedstock supplement and identify cells rich in protein content to enhance the overall protein yield.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Otherwise, they can rapidly evolve to turn into unpredictable events with significant losses such as delays of automotive traffics jams, catastrophic devastation assuming lives of innocent citizens as in man-made incidents or explosions, financial and industrial losses as in the case of malfunction or defects in manufacturing plants, and loss of natural resources as in the case of droughts, wildfires, and floods. First responders are at the frontline of counteractions against these incidents with their safety being at a major risk, while the effectiveness and efficiency of their actions may also need improvement for complete closure of the event or prevention of its growth. To further assist the first responders and disallowing the damage due to an incident, this research proposes a cooperative network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are equipped with novel sensing and imaging technologies and can obtain critical information for the safe and more successful operation of first responders by sharing information with them in a short span of time.

To achieve these goals, three interrelated research thrusts with the following intellectual merits are pursued: (1) design and optimization of coordinated mobility strategies and control for the proposed CPS so as to maintain high-resolution sensing and connectivity of the drones; (2) design of an aerial communication network to realize cooperative sensing/communication and develop power-optimized rate-controllable wireless system per each UAV to exchange acquired image data between cyber and physical agents and track the position of UAVs in the network; and (3) design of a dual-mode sensing fusion embedded within a flying sensor agent comprising a novel low-power, high-resolution mm-wave imaging module to detect mobile/hidden objects and structural defects, and an infra-red (IR) thermal camera to detect high-temperature radiations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Marine microbes are typically far apart from one another, so some of these exchanges occur through the release of products or services into the surrounding water, where they travel to other cells via simple diffusion. Understanding the degree to which such valuable products made by one organism are targeted to a specific partner, and how, has important implications for our understanding of the ecology and evolution of the marine microbiome. This project examines the role played by a poorly understood type of very small particle ? extracellular membrane vesicles ? in mediating functional interactions within the oceans. Extracellular vesicles are released by most marine microbes and are abundant in ocean waters, but our understanding of their functions remains in its infancy. As vesicles can contain diverse molecules, including active enzymes, and transport them between cells, they may work as a packaging and delivery system for goods and services traded between ecologically important microorganisms. Broader impacts of the project include providing hands-on research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students - including those from groups historically underrepresented in STEM fields - and the development of new active learning exercises to help increase knowledge about the roles microbes play in students? lives.<br/><br/>This project explores vesicle functions across multiple scales, combining -omics analyses, field experiments, and functional studies in cultures of diverse and ecologically important microbes to arrive at new understandings of vesicle contributions to cellular exchanges. These experiments incorporate an evolutionary perspective for exploring the range of vesicle functions and genetic mechanisms affecting their production, examining how their contents have changed in co-cultures of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria following hundreds of generations of experimental laboratory evolution. Fundamental ecological questions are addressed concerning whether vesicles, and their associated functions, act as truly ?public goods? in the oceans or can instead be targeted to a subset of cells, possibly yielding ?club goods? that define interacting, cooperative networks. Collectively, this effort will generate new insights into the mechanisms marine microbes use to interact with one another, and experimentally define the functional potential and ecological impact of EV-mediated trafficking networks in the oceans. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Biological Oceanography Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the key factors behind AI's remarkable progress is the efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs). These complex systems, akin to the human brain, excel at processing vast amounts of data, enabling them to learn and make informed decisions. Compared to traditional computer programs, DNNs have shown superior performance in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. Unfortunately, this improved performance requires substantially more energy and computational resources. This not only increases their running costs but also limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments like battery-powered devices, hindering the broader adoption of AI systems. Interestingly, DNN computations often involve many redundant operations, termed generally as ""sparsity."" This project aims to develop specialized computer chips and software programs that exploit abundant fine-grained sparsity to enhance AI performance while reducing energy consumption and computational costs. Outcomes of this research award will be integrated into educational curricula and research mentorship plans at the graduate and undergraduate level, to educate the next generation of computer engineers on the importance of hardware/software codesign for deep learning. In addition, an outreach activity is planned to increase the participation of women in the hardware development for AI.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the hardware acceleration of DNNs with fine-grained unstructured sparsity and mixed precision, two forms of redundancy that have yet to be exploited efficiently by existing computer chips. The research team focuses on optimizing unrolled DNN circuits on programmable hardware, starting with the current general-purpose hardware fabric of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and progressing towards DNN-optimized fabrics. A systematic benchmark-driven approach is used to specialize FPGA components for the implementation of unrolled DNN circuits. Furthermore, the team investigates more significant changes to the FPGA fabric, such as time-multiplexing and in-memory computing, to increase logic capacity and enable the deployment of larger DNNs. To extract maximum efficiency, DNN sparsification algorithms are codesigned, including pruning, quantization, and parameter sharing. This award is expected to result in new bit-programmable hardware architectures, DNN sparsification algorithms, and a research framework to synergistically codesign sparse DNNs and hardware.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Project broader impacts include research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and high-school summer interns.

This project aims to explore the origin and evolution of CH4 in deep-sea vents by employing the use of double-substituted and doubly-deuterated isotopologues (13CH3D, 12CH2D2). In a series of hydrothermal experiments involving organic matter decomposition. CO2 reduction and non-equilibrated CH4 gases in the presence of mineral catalysts, the distribution of rare methane isotopologue will be assessed by the use of a high-mass-resolution gas-source multiple collector mass spectrometer (Panorama, UMD).

For example, once an adversary gains access to a string of data, they may store arbitrarily many copies of this string and there is no way to verify that the string was truly deleted. Even if the string is a ciphertext encoding an underlying plaintext, an adversary can always keep that ciphertext around forever or distribute many copies of it to malicious entities. If security of the underlying encryption scheme breaks down in the future, or if the key is compromised, malicious entities may be able to recover the plaintext ? and this may be unacceptable for highly sensitive data. On the other hand, unknown quantum states cannot be copied, and measurements on these states are inherently destructive and irreversible. This raises the exciting possibility of building cryptosystems with strong deletion and unclonability properties by encoding information into quantum states.<br/> <br/>This research project enables these capabilities by carefully combining mathematical hardness with security that arises from the properties of quantum information. The first research focus develops cryptosystems that support verifiable deletion of sensitive data ? these include advanced encryption schemes, methods of outsourcing to untrusted servers, and distributed secure computation. These schemes allow untrusted devices and servers to prove that they deleted or erased private records forever ? even after they already had access to, or computed on, encodings of these records. The second focus strengthens the quantum no-cloning principle in cryptographically useful ways, to build strong foundations for unclonable cryptography. This leads to cryptosystems that prevent an adversary from splitting a quantum encoding into two or more states that meaningfully encode an underlying secret. The project also establishes mentoring programs and seminars for cryptography researchers and develops expository material to benefit an upcoming generation of researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field of developmental biology addresses this question that has intrigued humans since ancient times.  Scientists working in this field study various organisms, ranging from bacteria to invertebrates to vertebrates, including humans, and also plants. They use up-to-date techniques and methodologies to answer their specific questions.  Knowledge acquired from such studies by numerous investigators around the world enriches our understanding of developmental processes, and also provides a fundamental basis for practical applications that enhance health and wellbeing of living organisms on this planet.   Since 1939 the annual meetings of the Society for Developmental Biology (previously Society for the Study of Development and Growth) have been the major forum for reporting discoveries, exchanging ideas and establishing collaborations among developmental biologists in North America and beyond.  Cutting edge technologies have moved the field into the genomic era, allowing investigators to interrogate single cells during development and obtain high resolution images of cellular and molecular movements. Such studies also provide information about how cells or tissues change in disease states; and why some tissues are able to regenerate while others cannot.  These new technologies have also raised awareness of ethical practices; the SDB annual meetings have provided an important venue for rational discourse, as well as opportunities to train the next generation of developmental biologists.   <br/><br/>The goal of the three proposed annual Society for Developmental Biology (SDB) meetings is to continue to provide the primary meeting venue for scientists in developmental biology and related fields world-wide. Meetings will comprise plenary and concurrent sessions with talks by seasoned and new investigators, dedicated poster sessions and workshops/roundtables on topics of special and current interest.  Multiple talks will be selected from submitted abstracts to ensure breadth and encourage new and diverse inputs.  In keeping with SDB?s educational mission, the programs also include professional development workshops for trainees and pre-tenure faculty, postdoctoral symposia and networking opportunities for all.  A unique feature of this meeting is the Hilde Mangold Postdoctoral Symposium, where two postdoctoral fellows review eligible abstracts from their peers, select the top seven/eight for short talks and co-chair the symposium.  They practice peer review and session chairing under the mentorship of the SDB president, an outstanding career development opportunity for these junior scientists.  The SDB meetings are planned to be in-person but building on virtual meeting experience developed during the COVID pandemic, recordings of platform sessions will be made available for a short period post meeting, with permission of the speakers, for those who could not attend in-person.

Under the guidance of a psychology professor, the project will create an environment that enhances engagement, learning and innovation through diversity. A goal of this cohort approach is to shift geoscience education from a style based on gatekeeping to one that that is inviting and supportive of people from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The climate science community?s understanding of Earth?s long-term climate evolution predominantly comes from Northern Hemisphere climate records. Given the central role of the Southern Ocean in the global climate system and its proximity to the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Southern Hemisphere data gap severely inhibits our ability to understand global changes in ocean-atmosphere-ice sheet dynamics and carbon cycling during major climatic transitions. Records from the South Pacific are especially valuable to improve our understanding of these processes, because the Pacific contains by far the largest surface area and volume fraction of the Southern Ocean and therefore holds the largest capacity for carbon storage in the deep ocean. This project proposes to generate high-resolution climate proxy time series over the past 2 million years with emphasis across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) using new sediment cores recovered during Expedition 383. These long records will explore changes in climate/carbon dynamics at the ocean surface by reconstructing dust input, nutrient utilization, and export production and these records will be synthesized and interpreted with collaborators? records of sea surface temperature, water mass structure and circulation. Drawing from expertise across three US institutions, the project will produce an unprecedented suite of complementary biological and geochemical tracers at three drill sites (U1539, U1540, and U1541) in the Subantarctic Pacific.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, such exchanges suffer from information leakage, meaning that third parties can see aspects of the bidding or auction processes and this ability allows them to gain an advantage or unfairly outbid (i.e. front-run) the competition.  A related issue is the lack of transparency in exchanges, which often results from their efforts to limit information leakage.  The lack of transparency has led to significant issues at several centralized exchanges.  This project proposes to build an innovative decentralized exchange that will empower traders with a fair and efficient marketplace.  The proposed solution will employ state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols based on secure multiparty computation (MPC) to guarantee the necessary confidentiality without compromising transparency.  The project is not bound by the tradeoff between security and transparency - it will seek to provide both in an efficient system. Furthermore, the tools developed under this project will have potential beyond the financial sector, including improving methods to securely and privately operate with sensitive data.  <br/>  <br/>This SBIR Phase I project investigates the design of a decentralized marketplace by scaling secure multiparty computation (MPC) to a large number of parties. MPC provides a decentralized solution for executing an auction that is automatically front-running resistant as the protocol only allows the winning bid (or bidder) to be revealed to anyone. The proposed solution will address a key challenge of developing a concretely efficient mechanism to execute the MPC off-chain and certify the results on-chain with minimal transaction fees while guaranteeing maximal security. The proposed solution will take advantage of quantum secure primitives and star network topology to get robust security and minimal communication overhead. In this project, the first application to validate the designed auction MPC will be a decentralized Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplace and instantaneous withdrawal mechanism from L2 to L1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques. The prototype implementations will be integrated in real systems to test how the proposed accumulator protocols perform in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes can also interact with extreme weather and climate events, having a significant impact on the health and operation of multi-sectoral urban systems. With the advancement of smart sensor systems and computational power, researchers have been able to generate state variables for urban climates and systems research, which have demonstrated success in decision support for urban meteorological hazards. Despite this progress, there is still a lack of an urban analytics platform that provides coherent and standardized databases for urban climates and systems at appropriate spatiotemporal scales. This lack of an urban analytics platform impedes the generalization of urban climate research results across global cities and hinders the application of research outcomes to multi-sectoral urban systems. To address these challenges, this project aims to establish a global network of networks of integrated urban services (GNNIUS), bringing together scientific expertise and unique facilities and resources from different countries to address knowledge gaps in urban climate and systems research. GNNIUS will improve the inclusiveness and diversity of the next-generation researchers and will help advance fundamental science in urban climates and solve pressing societal problems with global and multi-disciplinary joint efforts. <br/><br/>Through a series of guided discussions and a workshop, the international coordination of urban climates and systems researchers and stakeholders will establish guidelines for initiating an urban analytics platform and protocols for applying it to better deliver integrated urban services across global cities. This network of networks will initiate a general urban analytics platform currently missing in the urban research community that is needed to advance understanding of multi-scale processes, harness the new paradigm of sensors and models to address the most consequential knowledge gaps, and consider co-benefits/tradeoffs in multi-sectoral systems for decision-making support. GNNIUS will create (1) trans-disciplinary dialogues between domain experts (i.e., urban climates and systems) and technical experts (i.e., sensor networks, sensing and control, uncertainty quantification, and big-data science).

Given the importance of early math, researchers and educators have created a variety of classroom-focused resources to support mathematical learning, thinking, and skill development. However, many of these resources do not take into account the important roles that parents, and the home learning environment play in supporting math learning and engagement. Current efforts also do not go far enough in countering deficit perspectives on families and moving beyond engagement strategies and activity structures based primarily on cultural models of learning from White, monolingual, middle- and upper-class communities. To achieve a new vision of equitable math learning in early childhood, it is important to disrupt power hierarchies between minoritized families and schools and reposition parents as central to children?s mathematics learning. Educators and researchers must also reconceptualize traditional ideas about math that are rooted in histories of marginalization and discrimination.<br/><br/>To advance approaches for addressing these systemic barriers, the project, Viviendo Matematicas, will conduct an equity-informed design-based implementation research (DBIR) study with the goal of developing a potentially transformative model for collaborating with Latinx families and early childhood educators to shape a more equitable vision of mathematics education in the preschool years.  Partnering with Head Start educators in Portland, OR, and New York, NY and Latinx parents with preschool-age children (3?5 years) who are Head Start eligible based on the  household's lower income, the project will extend prior equity work by using dialogic and asset-based approaches to amplify existing math knowledge and practices within families, broaden our collective understanding and appreciation of mathematics inside and outside the classroom, and identify design principles for parent educator collaborations that can be shared with other communities. Through the iterative, community-based design process, the project will deliver: (a) a strength-based framework describing Latinx early childhood math practices, (b) a program model and associated resources for supporting parent-educator math dialogue groups, and (c) design principles and theoretical frameworks underlying the dialogue program and how it supports a more equitable vision of math learning. By reorganizing traditional relationships between parents and school, the project seeks to empower Latinx parents and families as equal partners and advocates for their children?s education, as well as support the creation of sustainable resources for Head Start programs in our communities that align with families? goals and values.<br/><br/>This collaborative project is funded through the Racial Equity in STEM Education program (EDU Racial Equity). The program supports research and practice projects that investigate how considerations of racial equity factor into the improvement of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce. Awarded projects seek to center the voices, knowledge, and experiences of the individuals, communities, and institutions most impacted by systemic inequities within the STEM enterprise. This program aligns with NSF?s core value of supporting outstanding researchers and innovative thinkers from across the Nation's diversity of demographic groups, regions, and types of organizations.

Mechanotransduction converts mechanical load into a biological response.  Mechanically triggered openings in the cell surface (mechanosensitive channels) are the best-known cellular force-sensing systems. They are important for the senses of touch and hearing and have effects in many human diseases. A research challenge for the field is discovering molecules that can selectively trigger a mechanosensitive ion channel. Some molecules are known for triggering these channels but how they function in not known. Knowing how these artificial molecules function could help in many ways, including acceptance of them as a drug for treating diseases in people. The research supported by this award has the goal of discovering the mechanism of action for a new mechanosensitive channel modulator. Results from this research could be used to understand channel-associated diseases, producing benefits for society. Further benefits will be achieved through the multi-disciplinary research activities that will engage multiple underrepresented groups in research. <br/><br/>Piezo (Piezo1 and Piezo2) mechanosensitive channels are non-selective cation mechanosensitive channels, playing important roles in diverse physiological processes, including hearing, touching, and inflammation.

This mismatch diminishes the quality of science and management provided; many coastal professionals lack the lived experiences and knowledge to prioritize issues most impactful to people in coastal areas. Despite widespread recognition that increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is essential to sustaining the nation's capacity for innovation and discovery, there is a widening gap between the total number of marine science graduate degrees granted and degrees granted to those underrepresented in the field. Professional societies play a unique role in facilitating culture change within STEM disciplines by establishing and reinforcing norms and practices that advance greater diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, and accessibility (DEIJA). They are also important avenues for training students and professionals in relevant skills and in developing networks necessary to progress in their careers. Culture change in professional societies scales up to impacts on members, their home institutions, and beyond. The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) will assist the next generation of coastal and estuarine biologists and related disciplines in navigating the current culture while simultaneously dismantling inequities at the root of low DEIJA in the disciplines through the Changing the Culture of our Occupations to Achieve Systemic Transformation (C-COAST) program, which will provide professional development, mentoring, and networking to students and professionals at all career stages.<br/><br/>The C-COAST program will harness evidence-based strategies to mitigate inequities and shift culture in the coastal and estuarine sciences through two programs: Rising TIDES Conference Program (RTCP) and Leadership Development Program (LDP). The RTCP is geared towards recruiting and retaining a new generation of estuarine and coastal science professionals. It consists of a 16-month program that supports attendance at the CERF and two additional coastal and estuarine conferences, with virtual meetings in between. The program provides professional and near-peer mentors, training, and networking, in addition to the full suite of scientific conference offerings. The LDP will provide leadership and DEIJA training for current and future leaders by building a dynamic learning community that will prepare emerging leaders to become agents of change while helping current leaders use existing power to address systemic inequities. The goals of C-COAST, from short- to long-term, are to 1): recruit and retain diverse undergraduate and graduate students and provide them professional development, mentorship, and peer networks to support a sense of belonging and identity; 2) educate current leaders on how to be more inclusive and change policies and practices that lead to inequities; and 3) increase the leadership skills of and opportunities for future leaders and prepare them to make policies and practices of CERF and their home institutions more inclusive when they are elevated to positions of power.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology may address the growing need for a higher performing, sustainable portable power source. Advanced portable systems continue to grow in power requirements and batteries are limiting their usability. For example, commercial drones use lithium-based batteries due to size and weight limits. These batteries provide a maximum flight time of 30 minutes, which disrupts workflow significantly. The TFFC may help to expand hydrogen fuel cell portable applications for clean, sustainable energy.  In addition, the TFFC ultimately may contribute towards a shift towards lightweight hydrogen fuel cells in a wide array of verticals that require an energy-dense power source in a customizable form factor.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a new type of hydrogen fuel cell. The proposed technology, a thin flexible fuel cell (TFFC), uses an architecture that eliminates the heavy metallic parts (bipolar plates) used in conventional fuel cells, reducing weight, and significantly increasing energy density of the overall power system. The TFFC is a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell that is uniquely suited to lightweight applications because all the structural and packaging components that are conventionally fabricated from metals have been replaced by lightweight polymers. The resulting structure possesses power density that far exceeds those of existing fuel cells. The structure is ultra-thin (~ 1 mm) and flexible so that it can be formed into arbitrary shapes. The form factor enables highly efficient passive cooling through area-proportional convective heat transfer, obviating the need for active cooling components such as liquid coolants, radiators, pumps, etc. The result is a simple, highly reliable, lightweight, compact, low-cost power source that may be integrated into an unmanned aerial vehicle airframe that can operate over a wide range of ambient temperatures and conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accurate measurements of the ocean's warming are critical for understanding Earth's energy imbalance and climate anomalies. This project will employ a novel method of using seismic Scholte waves excited by repeating natural submarine earthquakes to monitor the global large-scale abyssal ocean warming. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the method, which will be expanded to the global ocean. Existing seismic data can be used to track abyssal oceawn warming back to the 1990s. The results will complement hydrographic measurements and improve understanding of the dynamics of the response of the abyssal ocean to surface forcing.<br/><br/>This work will provide new observational constraints on abyssal ocean warming over the past few decades. The investigators will systematically search for shallow submarine repeating earthquakes since the 1980s. Scholte waves excited by these repeating events travel along the seafloor, and their propagation speed is sensitive to abyssal temperatures. Scholte wave travel time changes between repeating events thus constrain abyssal temperature change. The sensitivity of Scholte wave travel times to abyssal temperatures will be calculated using numerical simulations of wave propagation. Sensitivity kernels will be used to interpret the measured travel time changes, to infer average abyssal ocean warming along the waves' path, and to quantify uncertainties. The inferred warming will be compared against hydrographic and Argo data where available.

In the US, a disproportionately high number of serious vehicle crashes occur on horizontal curves (25 percent of all fatal crashes), despite curves accounting for only 5 percent of total highway mileage.  The advisory speed of curves can change due to pavement condition changes caused by pavement aging and distress, and curve geometry change can be caused by resurfacing and maintenance. This can lead to a higher risk of crashes if the curve advisory speed has not been assessed, monitored, and adjusted in a timely manner. However, the current network-level curve safety assessment practices are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly for engineers, resulting in problematic curves often being identified only after crashes occur. To address this issue, this project aims to develop new methodologies that leverage low-cost mobile devices, intra-agency crowdsourcing, advanced and scalable algorithms, and a novel confidence-driven, decision-making method that will make cost-effective and frequent curve safety assessments technically and economically feasible. The methodologies that will be developed in this project will result in significant savings in terms of cost and labor for transportation agencies and will promote transportation safety equity, especially for agencies with limited resources. The research outcomes will lay a solid foundation for advancing the development of future technologies and tools, and, most importantly, they will take a big step towards development of a safe system that saves lives by transforming the reactive safety management practices into proactive roadway safety management practices. <br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to develop and validate two methodologies for network-level curve safety assessment by taking a multidisciplinary approach. The first methodology is a crowdsourced multi-run curve safety assessment methodology that will address the technical challenges in the state-of-art technologies related to different vehicle types, suspension properties and driver behaviors when scaling up from individual curve safety assessment to network-wide assessment with a crowdsourcing framework. This methodology will use a novel seed-propagation model and an iterative convergence feedback model combined with the curve-driving kinematics relationship and spatial-temporal analysis for simultaneous estimation of vehicle suspension and curve geometric properties. The second methodology is a trajectory and roadway geometry-dependent confidence level methodology that will enable informed, data-driven decision-making by quantitatively evaluating the confidence level of the computed decision-making outcomes, such as advisory speed, based on a vehicle?s trajectory and roadway geometry. The outcomes of this project will also be integrated into a wide range of classroom and research activities to train the next generation of scientists, engineers, and policymakers on innovative technologies that will promote proactive safety management practices and transportation safety equity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

WGD is central to the study of genetics, evolution, ecology, as well as agriculture and medicine. Nearly all agricultural crops are polyploid, as are many human organs (e.g., the liver, heart, and placenta), and at least one third of all cancers arise from WGD. Despite the importance of WGD, our understanding of this critically important speciation mechanism and source of raw material for genomic and phenotypic evolution is both limited and disjointed. The International Polyploidy Conference entitled ?Polyploidy Across the Tree of Life?, to be held May 9-12, 2023 (Palm Coast, FL) brings together researchers across diverse fields?cell biology, physiology, evolution, ecology, genomics, agriculture, and cancer?to discuss and identify commonalities that derive from shared polyploid cellular processes across organismal diversity, levels of biological organization, and fields of inquiry. NSF funds will be used to help support early-career researchers to attend the conference and participate in various networking and training opportunities.   <br/><br/>A central goal of the Polyploidy Across the Tree of Life Conference is to help uncover both the commonalities and distinct roles of WGD across lineages of the Tree of Life and at diverse levels of biological organization, i.e., gene regulation, cell function, organ formation, organismal performance, ecological responses, and landscape-level species distribution. This conference, with representation across currently siloed research fields of WGD, will promote dialogue and interactions that will hopefully lead to new, synthetic understanding of polyploidy and provide a foundation for translational innovations ? from biodiversity and biocomplexity to medicine and agriculture. To date, no single conference has explicitly addressed establishment, evolution, stress, development, and disease or considered polyploidy across major clades of life. Supporting the participation and training of early career investigators in the exploration of these topics in diverse organisms at the conference will hopefully stimulate new directions in polyploidy research by a new generation of scientists. In addition, the use of NSF funds will help support efforts to maximize diversity across multiple axes: scientific discipline, perspective, country, geography, gender, race, ethnicity, institution, and career stage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By 2050, the world?s population is predicted to increase by 35%. To feed this growing population, total crop production will need to double. Thus, improving crop production is an important aspect for enhancing the economy and food security within the US and around the world. These important goals, however, are negatively impacted by the fact that plant pathogens greatly reduce crop yield and nutritional values. This work focuses on corn, also called maize, which is a crop species of high agronomical value for US farmers and a staple food around the world. The goal of this work is to advance the limited understanding of how cellular components that are localized at the surface of corn cells detect and induce plant defenses when infected by bacterial pathogens during the early growth of corn plants. The proposed study will provide new understanding that will contribute to new strategies on how to establish resistance against diverse pathogens, thus likely be complementary to current breeding efforts. In addition to its biological importance, this project will provide diverse training to better prepare early-career scientists to be successful members of the national scientific work force. Undergraduate students will be recruited in their first year into a lab that provides a stimulating, challenging and open environment and allows for both scientific and personal growth.<br/><br/>As a staple crop, Zea mays (maize) is of high agronomic importance worldwide; but infection by microbial pathogens can result in substantial yield loss. Disease-causing pathogens include bacteria whose motility and pathogenicity rely on their flagella composed of flagellin proteins. As one means to protect themselves against infection by flagellated bacteria, genomes of many dicots and monocots -including maize- encode for an evolutionary ancient immune receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2), a plasma membrane-localized receptor kinase that detects bacterial flagellin or its active peptide flg22. Flg22 perception by FLS2 initiates many host immune responses that contribute to bacterial growth restriction. The genetic basis and the molecular machinery underlying flagellin perception and signaling in maize, however, remain largely elusive. This project will advance the limited understanding of the molecular components and mechanisms that contribute to pattern (flg22)-triggered immune responses against flagellated bacteria in maize. The objectives are to a) delineate if ZmFLS2 functions in flg22-responses in maize using reverse genetics and ZmFLS2 expression in Arabidopsis atfls2 mutant; b) define signaling potency of flg22 peptides in leaves and in roots of maize; and c) decipher if a maize ortholog of an Arabidopsis vesicular trafficking protein with roles in FLS2 trafficking to/from the plasma membrane functions in development and immune responses in maize.

One special type of plankton called mixotrophs combine both forms of metabolism, functioning as both plant and animal simultaneously. Because the extent to which mixotrophs rely on each process depends on environmental conditions, it can be difficult to predict their net impact on the carbon cycle. This is especially true in changing environments. For example, as Earth?s surface ocean temperatures increase, mixotrophs may respond both plastically (through reversible modifications of their physiological state) and through rapid evolution. This project combines mathematical models and laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that more phenotypically plastic mixotrophs will not evolve as rapidly because their inherent metabolic flexibility will reduce the strength of natural selection. The project also supports training and outreach designed to expand math literacy. Project personnel will train K-12 teachers, provide educational programs for museum visitors, and conduct undergraduate teaching at the intersection of mathematics and biology. Undergraduate trainees will also lead independent research projects and develop science education modules that allow high school students to quantify the effects of temperature on biology. Postdoctoral and undergraduate researchers receive training and professional development as part of the project.<br/><br/>To link mixotroph phenotypic plasticity and evolution to climate feedbacks, researchers are integrating experiments with mathematical models. A number of mixotroph genotypes from the genus Ochromonas will be phenotyped, and a subset will be experimentally evolved to test their capacity for adaptive evolution. Researchers are measuring rates of photosynthesis and phagotrophy in evolved lineages to quantify impacts on the carbon cycle, and genome and transcriptome sequencing are being used to identify the molecular basis of adaptation. A series of mathematical models will be developed to understand the mechanistic bases of plasticity and evolution, and to connect these mechanisms to their climate impacts. First, researchers use a model of cellular investments to contrast empirical results with predictions of mixotrophs? optimal plastic and evolved strategies. Validated model modules is being incorporated into upper ocean global ecosystem models to understand how these strategies change mixotroph abundance and contributions to the carbon cycle under future climate scenarios.<br/><br/>Funds for this award are provided by the Biological Oceanography and Ocean Education Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, increased flexibility in power network operation reduces operational costs and can help electric power distribution network incorporate higher penetrations of renewable energy resources. The project will develop operational planning and real-time control strategies for coupled water-power networks under uncertainty, develop economic contracts for flexibility, assess network resilience to new operational/control strategies and economic mechanisms, and update these new approaches to maintain or improve upon current levels of resilience. This research will help improve the economics, environmental impact, reliability, and resilience of coupled water-power systems. Further, the research will have practical impacts through collaboration with electric and water utility partners. The team will disseminate their results to the research community and practitioners, develop curriculum materials, and provide multidisciplinary research experiences for underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the fields of optimization, economic contract design, resilience modeling, electric power systems, and water networks. Task 1 will develop approaches for advancing the state-of-the-art in coupled water-power network modeling and solving the challenging stochastic optimization problems that arise in the coupled operation of the two networks. Task 2 will develop approaches to design economic contracts to ensure coordination of the water and electric companies and incentivization of the customers. Task 3 will advance the modeling and analysis of equity in who faces infrastructure vulnerability from hazards.  While previous work developed a general framework for measuring inequity in the loss of essential services across a population, this has not been integrated with detailed infrastructure performance models.

It is well recognized that social media platforms, while serving as a legitimate means for individuals to exercise free speech and share diverse views, are also susceptible to internal and external manipulation that may lead to adverse societal outcomes.  Using a rigorous mathematical analysis, the models and analyses in this project will study the effects of confirmation bias, media signals, and outside influence through autonomous users, on the evolution of networks of diverse agents.  The project will investigate the effects of targeted interventions that either reinforce individuals' current beliefs or expose them to different views.

In addition to the principal use case of social networks, the results of the project are relevant to a host of dynamically evolving complex networks, such as those describing supply chains. The project team, with expertise in operations researcher and political science, will train graduate students with multidisciplinary perspectives who can contribute to a rigorous examination of important societal issues.<br/><br/>This project will provide a robust modeling framework for studying the stationary behavior of Markov chains on directed complex networks via the use of random graph theory and local weak convergence, with the goal of obtaining tractable characterizations of their typical stationary behavior.  Theoretical results will describe the stationary distribution of the opinions on the network and will support evaluation of means and variances. Computational aspects of the project include validation of the models on publicly available real-world social network data from various data repositories, as well as experimentation with curated synthetic data produced by widely-used theoretical models.  The analysis will characterize the network dynamics and identify model parameters that contribute to the emergence of consensus or polarization. The network model studied includes as special cases the classical DeGroot and Friedkin-Johnsen models, and the investigation will provide mathematical proofs for models that have only been studied empirically to date.

During pregnancy, the uterus remains relaxed while growing and stretching to accommodate the developing fetus. Conversely, the uterus activates at term to produce forceful contractions for delivery, only to return to its original shape to prepare for the next pregnancy. If the uterus contracts too early, the pregnancy can result in preterm birth, which is a leading cause of death in children under five. The understanding of how the uterus remains relaxed, activates, and reverses its adaptations to pregnancy is limited - making it difficult to predict the timing of labor. This project will develop a computer model to identify how changes due to the growing fetus control uterine adaptations and mechanical function during pregnancy. This research will advance the health of pregnant patients and babies by providing an improved understanding of uterine changes during pregnancy. The knowledge gained from this project also has implications for other organs, where deformations of even a fraction of the amount observed in the uterus can lead to mechanical failure. Further, this project will support an educational program to foster engagement of pregnant and parenting high school girls in science and engineering. The research will be incorporated into a hands-on educational module for pregnant and parenting high school girls, who will be hosted for an on-campus college experience. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to uncover the mechanical signals that drive uterine growth, remodeling, and mechanical function during pregnancy. Based on the known mechanoadaptive capabilities of the uterus, the research objectives include 1) experimental quantification of uterine growth and remodeling biomechanics during a normal mouse pregnancy, and 2) building, validating, and testing a growth and remodeling finite element model of uterine mechanobiology. Critical questions to be answered include: A) How do uterine loading, growth, and remodeling interact and influence the mechanical cues that uterine smooth muscle cells experience? B) What mechanical cues control uterine smooth muscle cell growth? and C) Do the mechanobiological mechanisms of normal uterine adaptations apply to abnormal pregnancies? Through these experimental and computational studies, this research will advance the knowledge of uterine biomechanics and mechanobiology. The research is integrated into outreach activities that target pregnant and parenting girls, who are severely underrepresented in science and engineering.

The PIs leverage the increased visibility of enforcement agents and the increased reporting of profiling incidents to better understand the role played by enforcement institutions in the formation of group identity and inter-group relations in the country. Drawing on an original survey and survey experiment, the PIs examine how enforcement shapes the ways in which citizens and non-citizens identify their group attitudes and experiences with differential treatment. Findings will shed important light on the extent to which enforcement may exacerbate demographic group inequality, a question that has become increasingly urgent in recent years following widespread social protest against enforcement excesses in many countries. <br/> <br/>The project posits that enforcement is a key institution that shapes group identity formation and politicization, particularly in a context in smaller nation state in which enforcement forces have been deployed for out-group repression. In line with the policy feedback effects literature, the project investigates the extent to which interactions with law enforcement, a central agent of the state, serve as an important process of political socialization, teaching citizens about their rights and position in society. In the context of group fluidity in a smaller nation state, the PIs therefore hypothesize that experiencing enforcement will affect the likelihood that an out-group individual will identify as a member of the out-group, as well as to increase the degree to which their group identity is politicized. The research will draw on multiple measures of group identity to study how state coercion - during a period of heightened out-group enforcement - shapes experiences with differential treatment and strength of group consciousness along lines of both out-group and ancestry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This may result in a wait of 3-7 days during which time doctors determine the burn degree by comparing pictures from the first day and following days of continuous monitoring.  The proposed image processing and machine learning algorithm may provide clinicians with the ability to predict total burn surface area, expected resuscitation amount, delineate second- and third-degree burns, as well as prognosticate indeterminate-degree burns.

Vector-borne diseases are caused by pathogens transmitted by one organism, often an insect, to another organism with disease resulting from pathogen infection. The majority of these diseases have few to no effective interventions for control. Through short presentations, case studies, hands-on modeling exercises, and group discussions of ?wicked challenges?, participants learn about the biological connections across plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases from the subcellular to the ecosystem scale. The annual BVBD course is taught by internationally recognized experts to diverse participants from across the US and around the world, connecting individuals from all impacted regions. The BVBD course is unique in its content and approach to inspire diverse stakeholders and actors to concurrently and holistically address plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases as interconnected health challenges. <br/><br/>Plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases drive food insecurity across continents, devastate livestock production and cause the deaths of millions each year. These pathosystems are intricately connected in complex ecosystems that range from areas of dense urbanization, agricultural production from the pastoralist to industrial scales, managed forests and deforestation, and large regions that are increasingly subjected to extreme wildfire, drought, temperature shifts and catastrophic weather events. Within these environments, the shared biology and common drivers of plant, animal, and human vector-borne diseases enable not only pathosystem persistence, but also migration and invasion of new species of plants and animals that can fuel disease emergence and re-emergence. There is growing recognition that these connections across multiple biological scales can and should be leveraged concurrently to increase efficiency, sustainability, and efficacy of new control programs to improve health outcomes across all organisms. However, we face substantial intellectual and logistical obstacles in effecting these changes. The BVBD course delivers an integrated framework to break down intellectual and communication barriers that impede our ability to address these disease challenges in complex ecosystems. Because vector-borne diseases disproportionately burden the most under-served and under-resourced populations and regions, it is critical that BVBD participants and instructors reflect both the diversity of populations impacted by these diseases and a range of expertise and experience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The success of computational approaches to materials modeling hinges on having access to accurate, reliable and efficient simulation techniques across length and time scales. Most materials phenomena are multiscale in nature and properties of common engineering materials are often dictated by the properties of defects that interact at length scales much smaller than everyday macroscopic objects. As such, predictive computational tools suited to the length and time scales relevant to the problem physics, and techniques which span across scales are required. Data analytics and machine learning tools have provided many new and exciting avenues in computational materials research and computational mechanics. The best strategies for using these powerful new tools in multiscale materials modeling constitute an important and active area of ongoing research. The invited talks, poster presentations and panel discussions will inform the participants of the latest technical developments in the field and also provide the opportunity for experts to deliberate openly on challenges related to the aforementioned topics. These discussions are expected to eventually lead to new computational and data driven techniques for materials modeling, and to also drive the development of novel materials via bottom-up design strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also a driver of ozone depletion in the stratosphere. Natural sources of nitrous oxide include production by bacteria through processes called nitrification and denitrification. The ocean is a major source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, and areas of high biological productivity like eastern boundary upwelling systems have been shown to generate particularly high nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere. The Southern Benguela Upwelling System (SBUS) is arguably the most productive eastern boundary upwelling system, yet there are no published measurements of nitrous oxide from this region. In addition, the relative importance of the major biological pathways of nitrous oxide production in the SBUS is not well established. A team of scientists from the University of Connecticut and the University of South Carolina will investigate nitrous oxide cycling in the SBUS, estimate nitrous oxide fluxes to the atmosphere, and explore what drives changes in nitrous oxide cycling across seasons and in different locations. This study will improve understanding of an important greenhouse gas and how its cycling might change in response to changing ocean conditions. Funding from the proposed work will sponsor the training of a graduate student at the University of Connecticut and an undergraduate student at the University of South Carolina. It will also provide a postdoctoral fellow the opportunity to apply computational skills in regional modeling and machine learning, offering preparation for a career in academia or industry. The project will contribute to undergraduate education and communication of climate change science to the general public and policymakers through the incorporation of the study methodology into an undergraduate Service Learning course at the University of Connecticut.<br/><br/>This work seeks to provide estimates of the regional flux of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, to examine seasonal dynamics, to assess the biological pathways to nitrous oxide production and consumption, and to query regional and large scale forcings on nitrous oxide dynamics in the SBUS. To this end, the team will (a) measure nitrous oxide concentrations in samples collected in the SBUS during seasonal surveys, measure surface nitrous oxide continuously underway, and derive robust estimates of the sea-to-air flux of nitrous oxide from coincident windspeed; (b) query nitrous oxide production and consumption pathways from measurements of the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrous oxide and nitrate, and investigate environmental correlates of nitrous oxide cycling; (c) develop regional machine learning models for nitrous oxide from these measurements to investigate environmental drivers of seasonal and inter-annual nitrous oxide dynamics, predicting nitrous oxide in the SBUS with historical data and with hydrographic fields derived from a regional dynamical ocean model. The work will give insights into pathways of nitrous oxide production and consumption in an eastern boundary upwelling system bounded by a broad continental shelf ? contrasting the greater body of knowledge obtained from active margins. The statistical nitrous oxide models borne of machine learning will ultimately serve to predict nitrous oxide from climate projections of the SBUS, and to anticipate the regional response of nitrous oxide to global ocean de-oxygenation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, challenges in the advanced manufacturing of MXenes prevent widespread production and use. Manufacturing challenges include (i) difficulties in synthesizing MAX phases beyond titanium aluminum carbide, (ii) the use of hazardous acids in the synthesis, (iii) a lack of chemical stability, particularly in aqueous or humid environments, and (iv) adhesion and control in functional films and coatings. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to provide the knowledge needed to meet these challenges. This project involves new synthesis and processing avenues that enable the scalable nanomanufacturing of new MXene compositions while preventing degradation and new methods of controlled layer-by-layer assembly of MXenes in functional coatings. A special emphasis is placed on coating assembly features such as tunable optoelectronic properties. Additionally, education objectives include (1) mentoring undergraduate and graduate students alongside the GOALI industry partner, and (2) engaging the broader community via 2D nanomaterial-focused curriculum enhancements, a joint industry-government-academic workshop, and K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>The technical approach to meeting the challenges with advanced manufacturing of MXene nanosheets includes experimental advances in their synthesis, etching, and assembly. In one objective, this project utilizes alternative etchants such as molten salt solutions for one-step HF-free synthesis of next-generation MXenes with a focus on how etchant type and etching conditions affect MXene yield, quality, and stability against chemical degradation. In another objective, this project creates layer-by-layer-assembled heterostructured functional coatings containing these next-generation MXenes. The focus of this objective is on the water-based solution assembly of MXenes into unique heterostructured coatings that contain precisely stacked regions of various MXene types with or without polymers. The manufacture of conformal coatings with alternating blocks of polymer and MXene allows for tailored optoelectronic properties leading to applications such as Shottky junctions, Bragg reflectors, and optical filters.

They are used to self-manage diseases before or after diseases occur based on the sensed physiological signals. However, the temporal patterns of the physiological signals vary greatly for different individuals (i.e., inter-patient variability). A hardened detection algorithm will not be adequate for all patients to accurately detect the targeting disease (or events) with such variability. The current implantable devices, once implanted, only allow the parameter values of the detection algorithms to be iteratively tuned by doctors. To address the challenges, this project aims to develop the next generation implantable devices that are self-evolvable, allowing dynamic, continuous, and automatic adjustment of both the detection algorithms and the hardware configurations based on individual patient?s circumstances (e.g., data features, ambient environments, device conditions) throughout the devices? lifetime. A self-evolvable design paradigm with software-hardware co-exploration will be studied to enable low-power, low-overhead, and on-device model personalization and inference for implantable devices.<br/><br/>The success of this project will lead to higher detection accuracy, longer implantable device lifetime, and higher quality of care for patients with implantable devices. More importantly, this project will develop a novel cross-layer co-exploration design paradigm for different types of implantable devices to conduct personalized disease management. The education impacts of the proposed research include the integration of various educational activities based on the resources available to the PIs such as DAC System Design Contest and TinyML Design Contest at ICCAD; outreach for local K-12 students through ND?s CS curriculum for K-12 students in Indiana and an in-person webinar named KidSemicon; an online social forum that allows students, researchers, and engineers to communicate, learn, and share knowledge in the domain of reconfigurable semiconductor technologies; undergraduate research with emphasis on minority participation, and course integration of the research outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the goals of addressing future mobility needs and fostering safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation systems, advanced air mobility focuses on the transition from the traditional air transportation to future passenger or cargo-carrying services in and around urban areas. However, integration of air mobility into complex three-dimensional built environments presents many unique challenges in infrastructure design and operation. To address these challenges, this project will develop and test a novel airway system as well as the coupled operational rules and control schemes. These approaches are adaptive and scalable depending on the real-time travel demand, vertiport distribution and throughput, airspace capacity, and environmental footprint. The resulting advances are expected to impact multiple fields including transportation, aerospace, smart cities, and civil engineering. The research activities are closely integrated with educational activities to 1) support pre-college education and research through K-12 teacher training and summer pre-college programs, 2) promote undergraduate and graduate education and research by creating new courses, enhancing existing courses, and mentoring student researchers, and 3) educate broader community and general public through scholarly forums, university events, and network platforms.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to transform the transportation system by advancing the knowledge and capabilities of novel concepts, infrastructures, and operations for intelligent, automated, cooperative air transportation services in and around urban areas.

Quantum gravity is needed not only for conceptual reasons but also for the understanding of fundamental issues in physics, such as the big bang and black hole singularities. Various candidates have been proposed, and the research supported by this grant is devoted to loop quantum gravity. When applying it to cosmology - the loop quantum cosmology, a coherent picture of Planck scale physics has emerged: the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, purely due to quantum geometric effects.  This research investigates systematically this and related issues and shall combine studies in challenging physics problems with advanced mathematical methods, which will provide outstanding opportunities for students and collaborators across several different areas of physics and applied mathematics. The theory, techniques and methods to be developed will be used not only in the aforementioned fields, but also in a wider range of fundamental issues in physics and applied mathematics.  Particular attention will be put to recruit and attract students from under-represented groups in STEM fields and engineering.<br/><br/>Despite the various successes of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), an important issue is its connection to loop quantum gravity (LQG). The starting point of LQC is first to reduce the Hamiltonian by imposing homogeneity and then to quantize the classically reduced Hamiltonian by using the techniques of LQG. However, in LQG the processes of symmetry reduction and quantization do not commute in general, and it is important to understand how well the physics of the full LQG is captured by LQC. In the past couple of years, modified loop quantum cosmologies have been intensively studied, and the progress made so far is very encouraging, but several fundamental questions still remain, due to the dramatic change of the evolution of the universe in the pre-bounce phase.  The research of this award will be devoted to investigating systematically: (i) quantum cosmological perturbations and initial conditions from the full theory of loop quantum gravity; (ii) the evolutions of inhomogeneities, anisotropies and non-Gaussianities; and (iii) resolutions of anomalies found in recent cosmological observations, and observational signals of loop quantum gravity for current and forthcoming observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As major components of biological membranes, lipids form barriers that define boundaries for cells and their internal compartments. Lipids also participate in distinct roles that signal essential cellular processes, such as cell division and programmed cell death. These functions can depend on the cellular localization of individual lipid types and other biological molecules with which they interact, as well as their cellular locale. Within this context, this project will apply biochemical, chemical biological, and analytical approaches to investigate the role of a specific lipid group (ceramides) in cellular senescence, a process that is defined by the cessation of cell division. The outcomes are expected to reveal novel fundamental biochemical mechanisms that regulate lipid function in cellular senescence and to have important implications for broader understanding of the role of ceramides in biological processes. The results should also be generalizable to other cell types. In addition, the project will provide for training of a globally competitive workforce across the educational spectrum, including the participation of students and teachers in research and scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>Previous studies showed that ceramides are involved in apoptosis and replicative senescence. Replicative senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest that occurs when cells reach their proliferative capacity. It is a fundamental cellular process linked to organismal aging and wound healing, distinct from apoptosis. The pro-apoptotic activity of ceramides is well-studied; however, how ceramides function in replicative senescence remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms that regulate the production, cellular localization, and function of ceramides in replicative senescence. To achieve this goal, proteins that interact with ceramides will be identified, the functional consequences of these interactions will be investigated, and biochemical mechanisms that regulate ceramide levels in senescence will be determined. The project will use an experimental design comparing senescent cell line models to investigate specific mechanisms by which ceramides are involved in replicative senescence. Further, for the first time, the study integrates multiple imaging, lipidomics, and perturbation-based methods to comprehensively resolve the regulation, trafficking, and protein interactions of ceramides at the organelle level during senescence. The knowledge obtained from this project will open the door to novel studies investigating the impact of cellular locale on the function of lipid species in cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the microscale, cardiac tissue consists of a network of continuously branching and merging cardiomyocytes. These heart muscle cells form a complex microstructure with preferential orientations and sheetlet planes. Driven by an electrical signal, the cardiomyocytes shorten and lengthen leading to sheetlets, tissue, and ventricular motion. To investigate function and dysfunction across scales, this project will develop a multiscale and multiphysics model capable of relating observable macroscopic motion to its causes at the cellular and tissue levels. The resulting approach will be applied to investigate localized and diffuse abnormalities and how they contribute to cardiac dysfunction across scales. The microstructure-based understanding of cardiac function can advance the diagnosis and therapy for patients affected by cardiac diseases. The multiscale models will connect changes at the cellular and microstructural levels to tissue and ventricle scale deformation measures, which may lead to new diagnostic markers. Simultaneously, the microscale mechanisms leading to abnormal cardiac motion can suggest targets for therapy planning. To accelerate the dissemination and adoption of the results obtained in this research, the constructed modeling framework and deformation measures will be shared with the imaging community, integrated into the education of graduate and undergraduate students, and included in outreach activities with middle and high school students.<br/><br/>This project will develop a microstructure-based understanding of cardiac motion and function. The computational framework will model: (i) the continuous network of the cardiomyocytes; (ii) the complex mesoscale structure; and (iii) cardiomyocytes? mechanics and electrophysiology. Accounting for these discrete components will uncover how deformation of cells and cell aggregates lead to observed cardiac motion, e.g., longitudinal shortening, wall thickening, and twist during ventricular contraction. The identified deformation modes will be leveraged to formulate microstructure-based markers of cardiac deformation, which will be computed and tested using preclinical voxelwise experimental data. The framework and deformation measures will then be applied to understand the kinematics and mechanics of cardiac dysfunction in the presence of localized scar tissue or diffuse fibrosis and cardiomyocyte function impairment. Micro and mesoscale changes will be accounted for without a priori hypotheses on their effect, enabling the discovery of how cellular and mesoscale abnormalities are connected to macroscopic tissue and ventricular dysfunction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the inherent brittleness and high susceptibility to cracking of this material class pose major challenges to its production using high-temperature additive manufacturing such as laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF). This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant supports fundamental research that will generate knowledge related to a new hybrid manufacturing technique, combing in-situ rolling and sealing layer-by-layer during LPBF of W parts, capable of performing real-time modifications during the process, and thus, producing parts with controlled and improved properties. The research will enable knowledge-driven processing designs for the advanced production technology of W parts, which would open doors to new applications ranging from waveguides and collimators for hypersonic aircraft leading edges and plasma-facing components in unique fusion reactors, and thereby, create opportunities to strengthen the U.S. economy and national security. This project will also design and deliver intriguing hands-on educational and outreach experiences for the recruitment of diverse high school students to STEM majors and the retainment of undergraduate and graduate students from underserved groups, while ensuring their success in STEM-related careers or post-graduate education.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER award is to understand the mechanisms that govern the evolution of the structures and properties of W made by layerwise rolling and sealing in LPBF. The team will first investigate how plastic deformation and strengthening, induced by rolling and nanoparticle sealing, respectively, affect the thermodynamic driving forces and kinetics in W as well as impacts on structural evolution, while encountering process cycles of melting and re-melting. Experimental studies will include LPBF sample fabrications with in-situ rolling-sealing and materials characterization techniques. Crystal plasticity, discrete dislocation dynamics, and cellular automata models will be integrated to investigate into the evolution of dislocations, microstructure, and texture during the process. Next, the project will unveil the fundamental mechanisms underlying the newly achieved W structure and its role in the development of ductile-to-brittle transition and recrystallization. Fracture toughness testing will be conducted to investigate the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, complemented by the crack-tip plasticity theory and thermo-kinetic analysis to discover their respective contributions to the transition temperature. Furthermore, annealing followed by microhardness testing will be employed to identify the recrystallization temperature, with recrystallization kinetic models and thermodynamic principles used to determine the recrystallization driving forces. Then, how the fabricated W structure influence deformation mechanisms and mechanical behavior will be elucidated through tensile testing up to fracture at different temperatures to evaluate the strength and ductility. In addition, the plastic behavior and its contributions toward strength and ductility will be studied using the modified Clyne model. The research findings will offer insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the hybrid in-situ rolling-sealing LPBF and their influence on thermal and mechanical behaviors under various mechanical, nano-structural, and thermal constraints. Ultimately, the knowledge attained will enable the advancement of W materials through improving part performance and increasing the operating temperature limits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Liquefaction of calcareous sands remains an ongoing challenge, not only in Hawaii where the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake caused liquefaction of both dredged and naturally-deposited calcareous soils at the Kawaihae Harbor, but also globally in equatorial regions. The seismic resiliency of infrastructure, including ports, maritime terminals and naval facilities, is a critical component to the economy, emergency response, and security of Hawaii and the US mainland. Calcareous sands differ from quartz sands in several aspects, including intraparticle porosity, abrasive surfaces, crushability, and variable cementation. These unique properties mean that established relationships for evaluating the liquefaction hazard of quartz sands cannot be reliably used for calcareous sands without modifications based on fundamental studies. This research will improve earthquake preparedness of Hawaii and contribute more broadly to a fundamental understanding of this locally abundant material.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of this project are: (1) characterize the strain-based liquefaction susceptibility relationship for Hawaii calcareous sand and compare it to established relationships for quartz sands, (2) examine the dependency of the strain-based liquefaction susceptibility relationship on initial soil state and effective stress, and (3) collect site-specific cone penetration tip resistance and shear wave velocity to relate to laboratory-derived cyclic strength. In situ cyclic testing will be performed with the NHERI@UTexas T-Rex mobile shaker to investigate relationships between cyclic shear strain and excess porewater pressure generation below a depth of 2 m. The enhanced shaking at depth will be obtained by applying T-Rex to a helical soil anchor that is installed along with a special array of particle velocity and pore-water-pressure transducers to various depths of interest. Cyclic laboratory testing on site-sampled soil will be used to characterize cyclic behavior of the calcareous sand under an expanded set of conditions and initial states from the in situ testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, agent-based models will be developed and used to build expectations for evolution of populations living in different types of spatially heterogeneous environments. Then, using those expectations as a guide, the effects of spatial heterogeneity on the evolution of those bacterial populations will be tested using a unique semi-solid agar lab environment. Genome sequence data will be collected and then be analyzed using novel statistical models of molecular evolution.

Practically speaking, the sustainable future of human societies depends largely on urban sustainability. The research helps to unravel climate-carbon feedback and improve the awareness and preparedness of stakeholders, policy makers, and the general public to emergent patterns of local and regional climate changes. This project actively engages stakeholders, especially those from local cities, for project evaluation and outreach activities through regular meetings and annual workshops. In addition, this project involves participation of pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students from ethnically underrepresented groups in education, research, and stakeholder engagement, to prompt the principle and initiatives of equity, diversity, and inclusion.<br/><br/>This project integrates transdisciplinary quantitative and qualitative methods in the fields of atmospheric science, climate modeling, data science, and urban sustainability to discover nature-based solutions for sustainable urban development under changing climates.

The teaming exercise will help draw in additional expertise and engagement in workshops and pilot projects. Our cross-layer strategies will lead to concurrent advances such as novel multi-gate devices that leverage the polarization for compact implementation of complex functions, new architectures that harness the intrinsic properties of ferroelectrics, such as polarization domains and optical sensitivity, to support novel security and sensor features. and in-storage computing to support in-place analysis of large amounts of data.<br/><br/>Novel ferroelectric systems will have transformative impact on energy efficiency of computing infrastructure from large data centers to the Internet-of-Things.

Einstein?s General Theory of Relativity has been a highly successful theory of physics whose prediction of the bending of light was famously confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington more than a hundred years ago. That same theory predicted the existence of gravitational waves?a new kind of radiation that is produced in extreme astronomical phenomena such as colliding black holes.  On September 14, 2015, NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detected for the first-time gravitational waves from two colliding black holes. Since then, almost 100 such events have been observed. Gravitational waves from colliding black holes are the best grounds for testing if Einstein?s theory is the correct description of spacetime and gravity. Although Einstein?s theory has been remarkably successful in explaining precision terrestrial experiments and astronomical observations, there are hints that the theory is incomplete. Researchers at the University of Mississippi and Penn State have found a way to combine data from multiple events to increase the efficacy of the methods used. They will make use of sophisticated statistical inference tools to ascertain that the results are sound and are of high confidence, but at the same time make sure that noise artifacts in the data and other unrelated physical effects are not misinterpreted as a failure of the theory. The groups will train students in standard scientific practices and advanced analysis techniques and provide them with a platform to work with experts in gravitational wave astronomy globally. The team will also organize Physics and Astrophysics at the 'eXtreme' workshops to stimulate novel ideas via panel discussions and brainstorming sessions.<br/><br/>The improved sensitivities of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA to detect gravitational waves over the next three years will allow the detection of hundreds of colliding neutron stars and black holes. These collisions will release vast amounts of energy into gravitational waves and the detected signals carry the signature of relativistic gravity in action in unprecedented detail and will have the potential to falsify general relativity (GR). Due to the enormous success of GR in explaining observational and experimental results, the prior probability that the theory is correct is very high. Falsifying GR will require robust statistical inference that accounts for missing physics in the waveform models used in detection and measurement and mitigation of artifacts due to non-stationary noise. For example, most of the current tests assume that binary black holes are in quasi-circular orbits in vacuum, but this is not necessarily true. The principal goal of the study is to strengthen the standard tests of GR using singular value decomposition and to implement a new test utilizing the multipole structure of the emitted waves. These refined tests could reveal GR violations present in high-fidelity signals. It is vital, however, to have a comprehensive list of systematic effects that could be misinterpreted as a GR violation. The second principal goal is to assemble such a list, explore their effect on the various tests of GR, and prepare the collaboration to account for false alarms.

Soft robots have been of significant interest in recent years, with their compliance being ideal for sensitive, unstructured, or dynamic applications, e.g., medical robotics, assistive technologies, and manufacturing with fragile components. However, sensing, control, and actuation can be difficult in soft robots, with their soft bodies interfacing poorly with conventional, rigid electronics. Moreover, traditional mechatronic systems are not well-suited for controlling the large number of degrees of freedom of soft materials and may be incompatible with a variety of applications, e.g., in vivo medical applications. In this work, autonomous behaviors such as decisions about trajectory will be embodied in the soft robot itself via stimuli-responsive control modules distributed throughout the robot. The collective action of the control modules in response to the local environment can produce large changes to the shape of the robot?s body and its actuation behavior, and thereby to the gait, trajectory, and function of the robot. This award will also provide training in soft robotics and manufacturing to Pennsylvania high school teachers from rural and urban school districts. The integrated research and teaching plans will include practical strategies for building autonomous soft robots with multimaterial 3D printing and broader engagement of underrepresented and first-generation researchers.<br/><br/>The objective of this work is to establish a strategy for embodied sensing and control based on the use of control modules that regulate the shape and/or pneumatic logic of soft robots. The activation and deactivation of the modules will be autonomously regulated by stimuli-responsive materials, such as liquid crystal elastomers and magnetoactive composites, that are integrated with the robot via multimaterial 3D printing. Modules could be moved, added, or removed to reprogram the distributed control system and change the behavior of the robot. This work will use both numerical simulations and experiments with two types of custom soft robots, a kirigami-based robot and a modular rolling robot. The embodied control strategy will be assessed as the robots autonomously navigate through the environment, changing path, and function in response to multiple inputs (e.g., heat and light).<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The genome of every cell has thousands of genes, arranged in distinct, spatial patterns that give rise to complex, coordinated genetic programs. Each time a gene is turned on, the twisted, double helical structure of DNA must be uncoiled, to expose single-stranded DNA for RNA synthesis (transcription). As thousands of genes are simultaneously transcribed, the displaced twists of the DNA travel across the genome, forming a living, fluid landscape of DNA writhing. This project will develop new biotechnology to reveal how the dynamics of persistent twisting in DNA alters cellular activity and cell fate. The overarching goal is to understand the functional relationship between different spatial arrangements of genetic programs and the fluid landscape of DNA twisting. Using a combination of techniques from synthetic biology, experimental biophysics, and control theory, the work will allow researchers to experimentally visualize and model localized DNA twisting, in concert with gene transcription. The results are expected to provide practical understanding of how to spatially design synthetic neighborhoods of genes and ultimately, synthetic genomes that could be used in biotechnology. Research opportunities will be provided for graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, in collaboration teachers in the Santa Ynez, Santa Maria and Lompoc school districts in California, the project will develop curricula, hands-on training workshops, educational videos, and interactive life-sized spatial models to promote understanding of the programmability and the dynamics of DNA. <br/><br/>Biologists have previously studied the migratory dynamics of twisting in relatively short strands of DNA. This project aims to simultaneously visualize and integrate models for the processes of DNA twisting and gene transcription, which historically have been studied separately on different timescales. The PI has recently functionalized and integrated a magnetic tweezer fluorescence microscopy system with cell-free reactors in small-volume capillary tubes. This system, combined with an array of recently developed genetic circuits and reporter constructs, will be used to study of effects of DNA writhing and twisting on transcription. Simultaneously, the formation of higher-order DNA knots in linear and circular DNA, such as plectonemes, will be visualized. These are new in vitro methods for measuring how local supercoiling density alters or controls nearby gene transcription. The project also will develop new in vivo biosensors that measure the degree of localized twist and writhe in circular DNA in living cells, to link in vivo supercoiling to nearby transcriptional activity. In addition, biophysical models will be developed to describe how the spatial distribution, transport, and insulation of localized supercoiling controls transcription in DNA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But the end is now in sight.? However, this latter conclusion can be debated. Historically, exponential growth in semiconductors was achieved through two-dimensional (2D) miniaturization of devices (transistors, memory, and wires) to pack more components in the same chip area and achieve lower cost per function. Indeed, we are now reaching the physical limits of this 2D scaling paradigm. However, alternative approaches will trigger a seismic shift to reinvigorate the US semiconductor economy. This project will explore, identify, and map out the possible paths that lie ahead through partnerships among universities and industry/industrial research leaders in semiconductors, through educational efforts to translate new knowledge into the educational pipeline and semiconductor workforce, and through piloting new collaboration methods to enable lab-to-fab translation more readily with robust inputs from industry experts. This teaming grant will thus break new grounds for the future of semiconductors for domain-specific computing. The longer-term goal is to create national impact on research, education, and commercialization by encouraging students to follow a career path in semiconductors near national fab facilities. This is planned through multiple catalysts, e.g., a pilot program for lab and fab experiences for community college students, co-design challenges etc.<br/><br/>In the past two decades, it has become increasingly untenable to create architectures and device technologies independent of one another because there are intertwined dependencies across the abstraction boundaries. In addition, because of the extreme energy efficiency demands of future systems, architectures and device technologies must be driven by the specific application domains at hand. Thus, the focus of this project is device-architecture-application co-design. Building in the third dimension (3D, like a high-rise), with ultra-dense vertical connectivity between 3D layers, could significantly increase the number of devices packed on a piece of chip real estate in a scalable manner for significant benefits in energy and throughput, as, e.g., used by the Stanford Nano-Engineered Computing Systems Technology (N3XT) 3D approach. Multiple N3XT 3D chips are to be integrated through a continuum of chip stacking-/interposer-/wafer-level assembly/ integration. The foundation for this teaming activities will be the MOnolithic Stacked, Assembled IC (MOSAIC) N3XT 3D concept. Rather than relying solely on silicon-based transistors to perform all desired functions, heterogeneous materials and customized device structures optimally designed to perform diverse/distinct functions, i.e., domain-specific device technologies, will be used. The project will explore new domain-specific architectures (e.g., targeting AI deep neural nets, augmented reality/virtual reality, and graph analytics) uniquely enabled by the technology concepts, new Electronic Design Automation tools, and new open-source frameworks for device-architecture-application co-design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Einstein?s General Theory of Relativity has been a highly successful theory of physics whose prediction of the bending of light was famously confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington more than a hundred years ago. That same theory predicted the existence of gravitational waves?a new kind of radiation that is produced in extreme astronomical phenomena such as colliding black holes.  On September 14, 2015, NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detected for the first-time gravitational waves from two colliding black holes. Since then, almost 100 such events have been observed. Gravitational waves from colliding black holes are the best grounds for testing if Einstein?s theory is the correct description of spacetime and gravity. Although Einstein?s theory has been remarkably successful in explaining precision terrestrial experiments and astronomical observations, there are hints that the theory is incomplete. Researchers at the University of Mississippi and Penn State have found a way to combine data from multiple events to increase the efficacy of the methods used. They will make use of sophisticated statistical inference tools to ascertain that the results are sound and are of high confidence, but at the same time make sure that noise artifacts in the data and other unrelated physical effects are not misinterpreted as a failure of the theory. The groups will train students in standard scientific practices and advanced analysis techniques and provide them with a platform to work with experts in gravitational wave astronomy globally. The team will also organize Physics and Astrophysics at the 'eXtreme' workshops to stimulate novel ideas via panel discussions and brainstorming sessions.<br/><br/>The improved sensitivities of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA to detect gravitational waves over the next three years will allow the detection of hundreds of colliding neutron stars and black holes. These collisions will release vast amounts of energy into gravitational waves and the detected signals carry the signature of relativistic gravity in action in unprecedented detail and will have the potential to falsify general relativity (GR). Due to the enormous success of GR in explaining observational and experimental results, the prior probability that the theory is correct is very high. Falsifying GR will require robust statistical inference that accounts for missing physics in the waveform models used in detection and measurement and mitigation of artifacts due to non-stationary noise. For example, most of the current tests assume that binary black holes are in quasi-circular orbits in vacuum, but this is not necessarily true. The principal goal of the study is to strengthen the standard tests of GR using singular value decomposition and to implement a new test utilizing the multipole structure of the emitted waves. These refined tests could reveal GR violations present in high-fidelity signals. It is vital, however, to have a comprehensive list of systematic effects that could be misinterpreted as a GR violation. The second principal goal is to assemble such a list, explore their effect on the various tests of GR, and prepare the collaboration to account for false alarms. This two-pronged approach reinforces the impact of the tests of GR undertaken by the collaborations, while preparing the path to discovering new physics should it show up in the data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, while previously a jury had to be unanimous to recommend a death sentence versus a sentence of life without parole, the new rule requires only a majority eight of 12 jurors to vote for death to recommend the death penalty. Although research has previously shown that, predictably, death penalty decisions are more likely under a majority rule than a unanimity rule, the relationship between the sentencing decision rule and pre-trial decision-making (e.g., accepting a plea bargain) is less clear. One might assume that lowering the number of jurors required for a recommendation of death, thereby making a death sentence more likely, would increase the number of plea bargains accepted. However, there are theoretical reasons to believe that the opposite might happen. <br/><br/>Different theories of decision-making would argue for different impacts of a shift to non-unanimity on pre-trial decisions, with some arguing for a decrease in plea bargains accepted and some an increase in plea bargains accepted. Of particular relevance here are Shadow of the Trial theory and Prospect Theory, which make opposite predictions as the risk of a death sentence increases. The proposed study seeks to clarify our theoretical and real-world understanding of the impact of unanimity rules on pre-trial decisions. Specifically, we will gather real-world data on first-degree murder cases in the state of Florida both before and after the proposed change goes into effect in a few months. The knowledge gained through this research directly informs decisions made by legal actors, including defense attorneys and prosecutors. It is important to track the impact of legislative changes on the legal system at all stages, as this can inform decisions made in other jurisdictions that may be considering similar changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the number of women and students from historically underrepresented groups in computing is low as compared to the general population, recruitment and retention of these students into computing majors will help to fill the growing workforce needs. Over the course of this five-year project, fifteen institutions of higher education in Ohio will join together to form the Ohio Pathways to Undergraduate Computing Success (OPUCS) project. This consortium of nine four-year and six two-year institutions will devise transfer pathways that will increase the number of students who complete their Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science with a focus on supporting women students. This project benefits society by preparing students from diverse backgrounds for high-paying positions, thus meeting the needs of employers and contributing to social mobility for graduates and their families. OPUCS will also provide and study the impact of innovative structural support to women computing students at the academic institutions involved in the consortium.<br/><br/><br/>The OPUCS project objectives are to (1) establish a statewide consortium of nine four-year independent institutions, six two-year community colleges, and 15 industrial partners; (2) develop clearly articulated curricular pathways for students from two-year institutions to computer science bachelor degree completion at a four-year institution; (3) increase the number of students who transfer from two-year to four-year institutions and to complete their bachelor degrees within two years of transfer; (4) increase the number of women transfer students studying computing; (5) increase the number of women who complete internships with our industrial partners; and (6) establish an Association for Computing Machinery?s Council on Women in Computing (ACM-W) chapter at 75% of the consortium institutions. To complete these objectives, the project team will (1) develop an agreed-upon curriculum for the first two years of a computer science program among all OPUCS institutions; (2) use that curriculum as the basis for development of formal articulation agreements; (3) provide specific, detailed, and ongoing training to academic advisors so that students have a planned pathway for degree completion in four years; (4) provide faculty development training to improve the quality of instruction across the consortium; (5) train admission counselors so they are prepared to talk with prospective students about opportunities in computer science; and (6) provide tailored recruitment materials based on proven strategies from the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT). Contributions to knowledge will come from investigation into two research questions: (1) To what extent does building a clear academic pathway and offering a familiar social/professional support network among the institutions involved in that pathway lead to an increase in the number of women studying and completing post-secondary computing degrees across Ohio? and (2) Which activities of the OPUCS consortium are perceived as most impactful by women pursuing computing degrees?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deformation mechanisms and defects play a critical role in the mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties of 2D materials due to their atomic thinness. However, a fundamental understanding of how strain relaxation in these materials differ from their bulk counterparts remains elusive due to challenges in characterization at multiple length scales. This project aims to develop new electron microscopy approaches to observe and understand novel strain relaxation mechanisms. The insights gained from this study will advance the use of complex 2D materials in flexible electronics, quantum computing, catalysis, and protective coatings. Additionally, the project will support several activities to support broader participation in STEM, with a focus on underrepresented minorities and women, including a Research Experience for Teachers program for local high school teachers, interactive science demonstrations for young learners in collaboration with a local museum, and integration of research and education through curriculum development.<br/><br/>Conventional understanding of strain relaxation in bulk materials have not been successful in describing the deformation behavior of 2D materials and heterostructures. The central hypothesis of this project is that additional novel deformation mechanisms besides the traditionally observed dislocation-based mechanisms contribute towards stress relaxation in 2D materials. To investigate this possibility, this project will use state-of-the-art four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) and related techniques to map the lattice strain and deformations in 2D heterostructures. By investigating various sizes and shapes of 2D epitaxial heterostructures, a comprehensive understanding of novel deformations mechanisms in complex 2D materials is expected.

Considering that future traveling agents (connected drivers or automated vehicles) will possess strong learning and computation capability, and their travel decisions can be algorithmic, strategic and adaptive, this project will first investigate the day-to-day evolution of network traffic dynamics with these intelligent traveling agents, and examine whether the notion of equilibrium remains relevant for modeling and planning future mobility systems. Leveraging massive empirical data made available by connectivity, this project will then develop an end-to-end learning framework that directly learns relevant modeling components and the equilibrium state from empirical data. The planned modeling paradigm, if successful, has a great potential for widespread market adoption, and will save time and resources for metropolitan planning organizations to build and maintain their planning models. It can potentially help them better plan and manage their transportation networks to reduce traffic congestion and vehicle emissions, without requiring much new investment on expanding the existing infrastructure. <br/><br/>This project will consist of two thrusts. The first thrust develops dynamical systems by explicitly modeling day-to-day travel choices of intelligent traveling agents and then examines the convergence and stability properties of the dynamical systems. By demonstrating that Wardropian user equilibrium can still emerge in the day-to-day evolution of network traffic dynamics, this project intends to establish a behavioral basis for the equilibrium modeling paradigm. The second thrust aims to integrate implicit deep learning with network equilibrium analysis to develop an end-to-end framework that directly learns the behaviors of traveling agents, the equilibrium state, and other modeling components, if needed, from empirical data. This research, if successful, makes fundamental contributions to advance transportation network science. First, it innovates the methodology of modeling day-to-day traffic dynamics by explicitly capturing the decision-making process of day-to-day choices of travelling agents. Second, the  end-to-end learning and optimization framework represents a paradigm shift for modeling and planning transportation networks.

These massive and dense compact objects are hard to detect by their electromagnetic emission. Since 2016, interferometric detectors such as LIGO, VIRGO, and KAGRA have helped detect compact objects through the gravitational waves that they emit as they merge with each other. As the detectors' sensitivity improved, the field has moved from the era of notable single detections to one in which we can systematically survey the population of compact objects in the universe. The most interesting and informative detections are those that show complexity (such as overtones and modulations) in the signal, as these effects ultimately inform us about the environment these binaries were assembled in; existing searches do not account for these effects as they complicate the search algorithms. This research program will boost the sensitivity of searches to such signals, and hence extend the reach in the most interesting parts of parameter space - the highest mass mergers (extending all the way to several hundred solar masses), and binaries with very high mass ratios and misaligned spins. Detecting and characterizing these special systems can answer a range of fundamental astrophysical questions, such as the link between stellar-mass black holes and the more massive ones at the centers of galaxies, the endpoint of stellar evolution for the most massive stars (which collapse to the most massive black holes), and the means by which black hole binaries are assembled (from the configurations and sizes of the component spins). In a broader sense, the research program will also facilitate NSF?s long-term vision of building an outside community around the LIGO strain data, introduce fresh perspectives to the analyses, and maximize the potential of pre-existing open data: this will be realized by means of a workshop for the field, and collaborations with local researchers and established university programs to disseminate ideas among high school students.<br/><br/>The research is motivated by the presence of subtle effects such as higher harmonics and general-relativistic precession in the loudest individual signals, as well as tentative trends in the astrophysical population, that have already been detected. These events were found by search pipelines that made simplifying assumptions about the signals, i.e., included only a subset of the relevant physical effects; the most important assumption being that the sources are quasi-circular binaries with component spins that are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and that the waveform is composed of a single harmonic. The aim is to develop a new search that incorporates the effects of higher harmonics, and possibly even precession, and hence is sensitive to a wider range of signals. This will require revisiting all search algorithms in order to achieve the increased sensitivity without paying too large a computational price. The main tasks are to (a) organize templates to account for the diversity in the space of signals, while still retaining the ability to maximize over several geometric parameters, which will control the template bank?s size, and (b) devise methods of optimally combining the individual harmonics, as well as data from multiple detectors. This step is crucial to do correctly to avoid losing sensitivity to existing signals due to enlarging the search space. The methods build on existing full-physics waveform models that are routinely used for parameter inference, and insights from previous searches that used simplified waveform models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nature has evolved the ability to self-assemble nanomaterials into complex three-dimensional geometries in a sustainable bottom-up way. In contrast, most human-made devices are assembled through a rational top-down process which is highly inflexible, expensive, and unsustainable. This research seeks to combine the strengths of natural biomolecular self-assembly and rational engineering by encoding molecular recognition into high-performance materials. The goal is to develop a new nanomanufacturing technology to fabricate complex nanoscale devices, without using expensive semiconductor factories and methods. The new manufacturing approach enables a diverse range of applications, from tiny sensors with unprecedented sensitivity to electronic devices that can self-evolve. The research is integrated with an educational and outreach program that introduces self-assembly concepts to students from K-12 to graduate level and trains a workforce for versatile, sustainable, affordable, and accessible future nanomanufacturing.<br/><br/>Despite decades of development, molecular self-assembly has not yet yielded a disruptive nanoscale manufacturing approach. This is largely due to two unsolved challenges: (i) the lack of programmable complexity in achievable architectures built from diverse, high-performance nanomaterials such as quantum dots and nanowires and (ii) the lack of scalable yet precise methods for integrating these architectures with existing devices. This research aims to meet both challenges by maximizing the amount of molecular recognition encoded into nanoscale material components and macroscale devices. The solution is to place multiple unique DNA sequences onto precise locations on surfaces of nanoscale and macroscale components. For nanoscale components this is achieved by wrapping nanoparticles into DNA origami ?suits? or boxes via programming nanoparticle?DNA interactions, such as metal-purine base, electrostatic forces, DNA-DNA pairing, etc. These arrays of multiple unique DNA strands serve collectively as molecular zip codes allowing nanoscale components to autonomously recognize and bind to each other. For macroscale surfaces this is achieved by patterning with conventional optical lithography and then performing DNA origami conjugation with standard amine?carboxyl chemistry or with new molecular barcoding approaches to anchor thousands of unique single-stranded DNA in precise positions. This patterned macroscale device surface provides a multitude of docking sites for the architectures self-assembled from nanoparticles yielding the final device. By studying and understanding the thermodynamics of self-assembly processes, nanoscale structures, experimental parameters, and performance of the resulting devices, this research pushes the limits of what is possible to fabricate with molecular programming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Liquefaction of calcareous sands remains an ongoing challenge, not only in Hawaii where the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake caused liquefaction of both dredged and naturally-deposited calcareous soils at the Kawaihae Harbor, but also globally in equatorial regions. The seismic resiliency of infrastructure, including ports, maritime terminals and naval facilities, is a critical component to the economy, emergency response, and security of Hawaii and the US mainland. Calcareous sands differ from quartz sands in several aspects, including intraparticle porosity, abrasive surfaces, crushability, and variable cementation. These unique properties mean that established relationships for evaluating the liquefaction hazard of quartz sands cannot be reliably used for calcareous sands without modifications based on fundamental studies. This research will improve earthquake preparedness of Hawaii and contribute more broadly to a fundamental understanding of this locally abundant material.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of this project are: (1) characterize the strain-based liquefaction susceptibility relationship for Hawaii calcareous sand and compare it to established relationships for quartz sands, (2) examine the dependency of the strain-based liquefaction susceptibility relationship on initial soil state and effective stress, and (3) collect site-specific cone penetration tip resistance and shear wave velocity to relate to laboratory-derived cyclic strength. In situ cyclic testing will be performed with the NHERI@UTexas T-Rex mobile shaker to investigate relationships between cyclic shear strain and excess porewater pressure generation below a depth of 2 m. The enhanced shaking at depth will be obtained by applying T-Rex to a helical soil anchor that is installed along with a special array of particle velocity and pore-water-pressure transducers to various depths of interest. Cyclic laboratory testing on site-sampled soil will be used to characterize cyclic behavior of the calcareous sand under an expanded set of conditions and initial states from the in situ testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project, named Creative Computing Cookbook, investigates the co-design and implementation of instructor- and learner-facing resources to support equitable art and computing learning experiences. Recipes in the Creative Computing Cookbook guide learners in developing mastery of concepts and practices derived from the Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 Computer Science Standards as they construct their own artistic computing artifacts and performances. The students will learn to use algorithmic components such as control structures, nested loops, and compound conditionals, while also developing problem generalization skills that allow them to reuse existing code, emulating how professional programmers work. The project?s partners include two arts education organizations, Community Word Project (CWP) and STEM From Dance (SFD), which serve over 4000 students in the New York City area from groups that are historically underrepresented in technology. The project?s co-design with art educators and students will create authentic opportunities to engage in computing and artistic practices grounded in cultural and disciplinary knowledge. <br/><br/>The project will add to the body of work studying how code remixing can support learning computational skills and practices, and how that remixing can be scaffolded. Specific scaffolding strategies will be tested, like worked examples (wherein learners are provided with an expert?s problem-solving model via a problem statement and a procedure for solving the problem), Parsons problems (wherein learners arrange blocks of mixed-up program code into the correct order), and case-based reasoning (a constructivist theory of problem solving that will be used to inform how activities should be designed to help students process, index, reference, and apply prior cases to accomplish their current artistic goal).  Data to be collected will be qualitative and includes meeting notes, design artifacts, curricular resources, and recordings of pilots, observation notes, student artifacts, interviews with students and instructors, cognitive walk-through recordings, critiques, student reflections on artifacts, and teacher artifacts. Analysis will entail qualitative coding and the construction of case studies. The project will contribute broadly to the understanding of how to support interdisciplinary learning while preserving youth agency and embedding equity practices, and specifically to the understanding of how to scaffold creative computing endeavors. The cookbook and other supporting materials will be made freely available to other similar organizations, increasing their capacity to enact and support creative coding activities that can encourage underrepresented learners to develop computational skills and affinities. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.

To perform these functions, skin has multiple layers ? a bottom layer composed of cells that can divide and transform into other cell types, and top layers of cells that rarely divide and have specialized shapes with specific tasks. Recent research hints that mechanical interactions between these cell types help keep the layers separate and regulate cell divisions, but there are few quantitative models to carefully test this hypothesis. This project will develop a new biophysical computational model for skin layers that accounts for mechanical interactions between cells. In collaboration with cell biology experiments, this research will link model parameters to the expression of specific biomolecules, such as adhesion molecules or components of the cell cytoskeleton. It will then make predictions for cell and tissue shapes, as well as the rates at which cells leave the bottom layer to renew the tissue over time. These predictions will be tested in experiments. Finally, it will test the hypothesis that cells sense mechanical signals transmitted through the tissue and consequently alter the production of adhesion and cytoskeletal molecules, resulting in a mechanical feedback loop that helps to correctly regulate tissue growth and prevent disease. The researchers will provide a publicly available simulation code for 3D epithelial tissues, engage students under-represented in STEM fields in research and professional development experiences, and disseminate lectures and computational exercises on modeling cell mechanics.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to make and test quantitative predictions for the mechanical response of self-renewing stratified epithelia, using mammalian skin as a model system. The project will develop a novel 3D computational model representing cell shapes and tissue layers within the epithelium, constrain the model with state-of-the-art experimental cell biology and mechanobiology measurements, and then test quantitative model predictions for global tissue behavior. The work focuses on two objectives. In Objective 1 the team will use a first-of-its kind layered 3D vertex model to study the properties of the barrier/interface between the basal and suprabasal layer in both wildtype and knockout stratified epithelia, testing the hypothesis that heterotypic interactions between the two cell types and the basement membrane generate an effective mechanical barrier, and isolating how specific proteins contribute to that barrier. In Objective 2 the team will extend the 3D vertex model to study dynamic motion of cells across the barrier to understand how cell division, cell death, adhesion changes, and active cell migration drive delamination (i.e., allow cells from the basal layer to move to the suprabasal layer). The hypothesis that specific, cell-autonomous processes inside delaminating cells work together, possibly via mechanosensitive feedback loops, with tissue-scale mechanical processes (such as cell-division-driven unjamming) to precisely regulate cross-layer motion will be tested.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also a driver of ozone depletion in the stratosphere. Natural sources of nitrous oxide include production by bacteria through processes called nitrification and denitrification. The ocean is a major source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, and areas of high biological productivity like eastern boundary upwelling systems have been shown to generate particularly high nitrous oxide emissions to the atmosphere. The Southern Benguela Upwelling System (SBUS) is arguably the most productive eastern boundary upwelling system, yet there are no published measurements of nitrous oxide from this region. In addition, the relative importance of the major biological pathways of nitrous oxide production in the SBUS is not well established. A team of scientists from the University of Connecticut and the University of South Carolina will investigate nitrous oxide cycling in the SBUS, estimate nitrous oxide fluxes to the atmosphere, and explore what drives changes in nitrous oxide cycling across seasons and in different locations. This study will improve understanding of an important greenhouse gas and how its cycling might change in response to changing ocean conditions. Funding from the proposed work will sponsor the training of a graduate student at the University of Connecticut and an undergraduate student at the University of South Carolina. It will also provide a postdoctoral fellow the opportunity to apply computational skills in regional modeling and machine learning, offering preparation for a career in academia or industry. The project will contribute to undergraduate education and communication of climate change science to the general public and policymakers through the incorporation of the study methodology into an undergraduate Service Learning course at the University of Connecticut.<br/><br/>This work seeks to provide estimates of the regional flux of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, to examine seasonal dynamics, to assess the biological pathways to nitrous oxide production and consumption, and to query regional and large scale forcings on nitrous oxide dynamics in the SBUS. To this end, the team will (a) measure nitrous oxide concentrations in samples collected in the SBUS during seasonal surveys, measure surface nitrous oxide continuously underway, and derive robust estimates of the sea-to-air flux of nitrous oxide from coincident windspeed; (b) query nitrous oxide production and consumption pathways from measurements of the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrous oxide and nitrate, and investigate environmental correlates of nitrous oxide cycling; (c) develop regional machine learning models for nitrous oxide from these measurements to investigate environmental drivers of seasonal and inter-annual nitrous oxide dynamics, predicting nitrous oxide in the SBUS with historical data and with hydrographic fields derived from a regional dynamical ocean model. The work will give insights into pathways of nitrous oxide production and consumption in an eastern boundary upwelling system bounded by a broad continental shelf ? contrasting the greater body of knowledge obtained from active margins. The statistical nitrous oxide models borne of machine learning will ultimately serve to predict nitrous oxide from climate projections of the SBUS, and to anticipate the regional response of nitrous oxide to global ocean de-oxygenation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large scale infrastructure investments in the water sector will be needed to maintain reliable water supply globally in a changing climate. To enable resilience at lower cost, adaptive management approaches have been developed to monitor gradual changes in precipitation patterns to guide adaptations. However, existing adaptive management approaches are confounded by the presence of multi-year climate oscillations, which make it difficult to infer long-term trends from near-term observations. This grant supports research that seeks to address this gap by integrating climate science on multi-year oscillations with decision-support modeling for water resources management. The outcome of this research is expected to help water planners identify low-cost, adaptive approaches to maintain water supply reliability. The research team will partner with water planners to make sure the research is useful for decision-making. Additionally, the grant will support new interactive educational materials in water resources management.<br/><br/>This project designs new adaptive management strategies for water supply planning that can address uncertainty in climate trends, multi-year large-scale climate oscillations, and annual variability. It will develop an approach for decomposing precipitation uncertainty into these three timescales and quantifying future opportunities to reduce uncertainty in each timescale. This uncertainty characterization will be integrated into stochastic dynamic optimization models of water resource systems. This approach will be used to assess the potential for different combinations of adaptive strategies including flexibility in the timing, sizing, modularity, and operations of water supply infrastructure to address the different timescales of uncertainty in future precipitation. By applying this approach to river basins in sub-Saharan Africa with contrasting patterns of precipitation variability, the project will build theory on how different temporal patterns of precipitation variability affect adaptive approaches to water infrastructure planning, design, and operations. This new knowledge can help water planners target water supply infrastructure investment to support low-cost water supply reliability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, monolithic cloud applications are being replaced with graphs of smaller, simpler ?microservices? for reduced development complexity and increased code velocity. Further, such microservices are managed by cloud-native systems automatically, liberating cloud users from onerous operations of their in-cloud applications. Unfortunately, systems software that underpins cloud-native systems, such as virtualization, faces critical challenges to meeting the stringent needs of emerging microservices-based cloud applications, such as strong-yet-lightweight isolation, fast inter-microservice communication, and fine-grained elasticity control. This CAREER project proposes to conduct a holistic study of virtualization techniques to 1) identify critical bottlenecks in resource isolation, I/O communication, and service elasticity; 2) propose new system virtualization solutions to address these bottlenecks; and 3) validate the proposed solutions with real-world prototypes. The knowledge developed in this project will advance the key aspects of systems software in cloud-native systems, thus benefiting all cloud applications that are integral to society running on these systems. The research outcomes will have influences on the design and implementation of production cloud-native systems via university-enterprise collaborations and technology transfer and be integrated into core computer science courses. This project will provide training in the computer systems domain to graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students, via diverse outreach plans of summer camps, high school student/instructor mentorship, and the inclusion of underrepresented minority and women engineers.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of the CAREER project is to investigate and develop virtualization techniques for highly secure, efficient, and elastic cloud-native systems. First, the project will develop a strong-yet-lightweight isolation architecture for efficiently and securely sandboxing distributed microservices. It will move monolithic kernel functions to more isolated and lightweight userspace kernel microservices to provide system services to (and sandbox) all microservices of a cloud-native application. Second, the project will build fast userspace (network and storage) data planes tailored for interactive microservices. It will retrofit kernel I/O stacks to preserve high-quality kernel functionality meanwhile augmenting existing I/O stacks to address critical inter-layer data communication/processing bottlenecks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particular focus will be to determine possible effects that black hole radiation from that time period could have on the cosmic background radiation.  If there are potentially observable effects, then these could provide information about the existence of primordial black holes during inflation. Hawking?s original calculation of black hole evaporation gave information about how black holes evaporate at late times after the black hole forms.  A detailed study will be made of quantum effects that occur at early and intermediate times in the black hole formation process in a simple model of black hole formation. The results may provide insight into the important question of what happens to the information when a black hole is created.  Analog black holes are systems that can be studied in the laboratory and mimic one or more aspects of real black holes.  Analog black holes have been made from Bose-Einstein condensates that consist of Rubidium atoms that have been cooled to very low temperatures.  Theoretical calculations, similar in nature to those for real black holes, will be made and used to predict the values for certain quantities for these analog black holes that have been measured in the laboratory.  If the agreement is found with the experimental data, then that will provide evidence that predictions made by Hawking and others relating to quantum effects in real black holes are correct.  The semiclassical approximation in gravity provides a bridge between Einstein?s theory of gravity, general relativity, and a fully quantum theory of gravity.  It has been used to study particle production in the early universe as well as black hole evaporation.  The validity of the semiclassical approximation will be investigated for two different early universe scenarios.  One is for simple models in which the Universe first contracts to a minimum size and then begins expanding.  The other is particle production in an important model of inflation called Starobinsky inflation.  The particle production occurs after inflation is over and fills the Universe back up with matter and radiation.  Two or three graduate students will participate in various aspects of the research. The project will include undergraduate students, continuing a long history of the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in numerical and analytical research techniques and co-authorship on publications.  Results will be disseminated to the research community through publications and presentations at national and/or international meetings. <br/><br/>The research will address black hole evaporation, observable effects in Bose-Einstein condensates which can serve as black hole analogs, and early universe cosmology. Specifically, it will investigate questions related to whether observable effects could arise from primordial black hole evaporation during inflation, the information about how a black hole forms, the correspondence between theoretical and experimental results related to quantum effects in analog black hole systems, and the validity of the semi-classical approximation in the early universe.   For black hole evaporation during inflation, one goal is to determine the effects it could have on the cosmic background radiation.  Other quantum effects related to primordial black holes will also be investigated.   Black hole evaporation will also be studied in the case that a spherically symmetric shell of radiation collapses to form a black hole.   Objectives include gaining insight into the question of what happens to the information about how a black hole forms and to check the accuracy of similar calculations in two dimensional dilaton theories of gravity.  Bose-Einstein condensates that can serve as analog black holes have been studied in the laboratory.  The goal of the research in this area is to determine whether certain experimental results for Bose-Einstein condensates which can serve as analog black holes are in quantitative agreement with predictions resulting from quantum field theory in curved space calculations in the analog spacetimes.  The semiclassical approximation has been used to study important effects in the early universe such as reheating after inflation.  One goal of the research is to determine whether the semiclassical approximation is valid in certain models in which the universe contracts to a minimum size and then expands and in the post-inflation era of a well-known model of inflation, sometimes called Starobinsky inflation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to increase the U.S.?s global competitiveness in STEM, it is crucial to support mathematics learning. Although there are promising innovations from researchers around mathematics learning, it is challenging for researchers, especially those who are junior or from less privileged institutions, to test and refine their innovations and make effective innovations broadly accessible to educators and students. Infrastructure is needed to connect researchers and educators through low-cost, low-barrier tools. The activities of this Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Incubator project include designing and planning a ?plug and play? research infrastructure that allows greater numbers of researchers to develop, test, scale, and share innovations with potential to support mathematics learning. The infrastructure?s capabilities will be transformative for the field of mathematics education research, as more and more diverse researchers will be able to conduct studies in ways that were not previously possible without substantial overhead. <br/><br/>The Incubator will support planning meetings among the technology-focused non-profit Gooru, researchers from the learning sciences, mathematics education, computer science, psychological science, and a panel of administrator, educator, and teacher representatives as a steering committee. This team will develop draft protocols for protecting student privacy, vetting researcher applications, vetting study designs and materials, recruiting researchers and school participants, and structuring both the technical and human resources side of the research infrastructure. The materials developed in this project will be shared with broader cohorts of researchers, educators, education leaders, and graduate students for feedback. These protocols will be used in submitting a Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure grant to NSF that would fully develop tools and dashboards to provide researchers with the opportunity to configure their innovations to operate in Gooru Navigator, identify and obtain consent for the use of anonymized data from Navigator users to efficiently validate their research, and request that their validated innovations be integrated into Gooru Navigator?s open platform. The materials created as part of this incubator will contribute to researchers' understanding of topics, such as data management, privacy, and research-practice partnerships, allowing others to build upon this work in further advancement of mathematics education. The ultimate goal is that the fully developed and tested innovations from the participating researchers be applied by teachers to improve mathematics instruction and learning.<br/><br/>This project is supported through a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and the Walton Family Foundation. The award co-funded in part by the Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) which seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Hyperbolic geometry plays a crucial role in several scientific fields, including mathematics, physics, biology, and machine learning. By exploiting the benefits of asymptotically hyperbolic time surfaces, called hyperboloidal surfaces, we can efficiently represent outgoing waves in an infinite domain, allowing us to access the gravitational wave flux far away from its sources and avoid the outer boundary treatment of finite computational grids. This award will contribute to the broader understanding of the interactions between wave propagation and hyperbolic geometry and provide applications to improve the solution of fundamental problems in science and engineering. Additionally, it will support the education and training of a highly interdisciplinary student and promote public scientific literacy through outreach efforts, including a summer school on wave propagation.<br/><br/>The hyperboloidal compactification technique maps infinite domains to finite regions using scri-fixing and Penrose compactification, thereby translating global problems into local ones. This technique significantly benefits the numerical and analytical treatment of spacetime perturbations and gravitational waves. The award activity will be divided into five subprojects to investigate the applications of hyperboloidal surfaces with different focuses and risk profiles. The first three subprojects focus on (i) broadening the range of applications of the method in black hole perturbation theory, (ii) providing detailed numerical analysis, and (iii) implementing hyperboloidal compactification for scattering problems in unbounded domains. The fourth subproject will experiment with bending up time surfaces to improve the computational efficiency of existing codes for nonlinear Einstein equations. The fifth subproject will explore the application of hyperboloidal surfaces to quantum fields in black hole spacetimes. The potential contributions of the project include improving the numerical and analytical treatment of spacetime perturbations and gravitational waves, providing rigorous guidelines for the choices of free parameters, and opening up new directions for future research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But there are many scenarios where speech and whisper are not viable due to ambient noise or because of privacy and security concerns, or even simply not to disturb other people. A system that understands speech by visually interpreting lip movements, known as image-based lip reading or silent speech, can mitigate many of these challenges. However, silent speech recognition systems are typically slower and more error prone than common speech recognition models, and they may require hardware that is impractical in real-world scenarios. Hence to date this approach has not been investigated as a serious alternative mode of interaction on mobile devices, and it is unknown how best to design the user interface for silent speech or the types of feedback that can enhance its usability. Silent speech has also not been well studied with people without sight. This research will develop an efficient real-time lip reader that uses the front camera of a mobile device to capture the motion of the lips and interprets that into text.  A particular focus is on the design of an intuitive user interface that provides a range of visual, auditory, and tactile feedback to facilitate error free text entry. Even broader impacts will derive from providing access to mobile devices to a wider range of users, such as persons with speech disorders or who are mute. Ultimately, project outcomes could be exploited in virtual reality, automotive user interfaces, and many other systems to increase their usability, privacy, security and accessibility.<br/> <br/>The real-time lip reader will slice and overlap live video feeds from a mobile camera to recognize one phoneme at a time as the user silently speaks by using a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), a recurrent network, and the connectionist temporal classification loss. It will be augmented with a refiner channel that will detect, auto-correct and provide feedback on both character and word-level errors using deep denoising autoencoder (DDA) and custom language models. A range of auditory and tactile feedback will be developed to facilitate error free input and uninterrupted camera view for people with low vision and blindness. The project will also develop multi-modal error correction approaches by exploiting speech, silent speech, and touch interactions. Finally, it will build a silent speech recognition API for the design and development of accessible mobile input and interaction techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These robots have the potential to provide unique benefits to society, but their development has been slowed by major engineering challenges. The goal of this project is to demonstrate both agile maneuvers and precise hover, for flight durations of up to ten seconds using only on-board power. These capabilities will set insect-scale flying robots on the path to important future applications, such as assisting in the pollination of crops, or conducting remote inspections of inaccessible areas. Some features of these robots are inspired by their biological analogs, such as the soft, muscle-like actuators that drive their wings. Other important functions, such as hovering at a precise location, must diverge from natural strategies due to size, weight, and power restrictions. For example, when the robot attains its desired orientation it resists disturbances such as wind gusts by using its wings to spin like a top. And, rather than carry a heavy and power-hungry high-speed camera and image processing system, the hovering robot will rely on low-frequency updates from nearby companion robots to correct its flight. The research is complemented by educational and outreach activities including exhibits at distinguished science museums in Boston and New York, programs for underrepresented high school and undergraduate students hosted through MIT?s summer research programs, and workshops organized at international robotics conferences.<br/><br/>This project will develop soft-actuated micro-aerial-robots capable of demonstrating insect-like agile maneuvers and passively stable untethered flight. We aim to enable transformative flight capabilities through leveraging the unique properties of dielectric elastomer actuators and the dynamics of insect-scale robots. Specifically, the project will focus on the following three directions: (i) demonstrate fast (>1.5 m/s) flight and acrobatic maneuvers such as rapid banked turns and somersaults; (ii) leverage passive stability and implement low frequency (<5 Hz) vision-based tracking to demonstrate hovering flight without requiring the state-of-the-art infrared indoor tracking system; and (iii) incorporate compact power electronics and a battery to achieve a 10-second untethered flight in a 2.3 g soft aerial robot. Achieving these flight capabilities will represent a major milestone in the long-term effort of developing fully autonomous insect-scale aerial robots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The practice of biomimicry requires a diverse group of scientists and engineers equipped with technical knowledge of biomimicry and interdisciplinary, cross-cultural research experience. To meet this need, the BIOFLOW IRES Track-1 site delivers international research experience to US students, operated by Cleveland State University (CSU) and University of Akron (UA) through a long-time partnership with the Biofluid & Biomimic Research Center (BBRC) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), South Korea. As a Korean government-funded National Creative Research Center, BBRC has excelled at advancing the knowledge of bio-fluid flow physics in Nature and developing bio-inspired engineering solutions. The BIOFLOW IRES project leverages the world-class resources of bio-flow and biomimicry expertise, research facilities, and equipment for a diverse group of 18 US students to conduct creative bio-inspired research, gain solid research and communication skills, and build a professional network. This group of students is well-prepared to embark on their careers as future leading researchers, scientists, and ambassadors for biomimicry research and innovative design. The collaborative IRES project opens up new interdisciplinary research collaboration that bridge biology and engineering, strengthens international research partnerships, and contributes to enhancing the competitiveness of the US workforce in the global economy. <br/><br/><br/>The BIOFLOW IRES project aims to provide future scientists and engineers with a global, cross-cultural perspective, and professional growth opportunities through cutting-edge international research training, structured mentoring, and networking opportunities. Research on bio-fluid flows and biomimicry focuses on two complementary research themes addressing the Grand challenges: enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience of the built environment. The IRES participants perform wind-tunnel tests to evaluate the effectiveness of a seal-whisker-inspired turbine blade for vertical axis wind turbines, explore how the shapes of plant leaves affect energy exchange, and create tree-like flow-control devices to suppress rooftop vortices in high winds. Research discovers new knowledge of working principles of bio-fluid flow phenomena in biology and catalyzes original engineering innovations to achieve enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience. IRES students gain authentic research training in advanced thermal/flow measurements, critical thinking, and career-building skills benefiting from extraordinary resources at US labs of CSU/UA and the Koerean host lab BBRC. Along with innovative research, the IRES students participate in social and cultural exchange activities to enhance student-faculty, student-mentor, and student-student connection, starting a professional network for future collaboration and career development, an impact beyond the IRES program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The insights and new methods from this work will enable the development of next generation robots that can actively ?harvest? environment interaction forces, or even large disturbances, to generate agile movements. This capability can significantly reduce robot control effort and computational complexity in challenging environments, and therefore empower legged robots for a broader range of applications important for national health, prosperity, and welfare, such as environment monitoring, earthquake rescue, and planetary exploration.

Upon robot leg contact, sand and soil can deform and flow like a fluid, or jam like a solid, while loosely embedded rocks and boulders can slide or rotate, causing robots to slip, stuck, or even flip over. To overcome this challenge, this research will integrate locomotion experiments, granular physics theory, and dynamical systems methods, to determine how intrinsic terrain properties and leg-terrain contact modes influence terrain responses and the resulting robot locomotion dynamics. This new knowledge will allow robots to incorporate predicted terrain forces as part of their locomotion control, to produce desired dynamics across different environments.

Over three years, the project will train 24 U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, with a recruitment focus on underrepresented groups in STEM fields. In order to investigate how variation in land management practices by residents affects the integrity of landscape ecological processes, as well as human health and well-being, participating students will conduct field research on forests, birds, and people within a fragmented tropical landscape Through intensive mentoring by U.S. and Ecuadorian researchers before, during, and after the international experience, students will gain training in developing research hypotheses and study design, collecting field data, and analysis and dissemination of research findings, including in peer-reviewed publications. By targeting students from underrepresented groups, the project will help increase the diversity of ideas and perspectives on factors that either exacerbate, or ameliorate, the effects of land management practices on environmental and human health.<br/><br/>The research to be undertaken by U.S. students will take place within Ecuador?s Chocó Biogeographic Zone, where local management styles range from intensive deforestation for agriculture and cattle to maintaining high tree cover for hunting and sustainable harvest activities.<br/><br/>Our over-arching hypothesis is that higher tree cover in this landscape will benefit natural systems (via promoting seed dispersal by fruit-eating vertebrates) and human systems (by improving food security and reducing thermal stress). To evaluate how tree cover effects the diversity, abundance, and foraging of fruit-eating birds, participants will be able to combine satellite imagery analysis with field-based quantification of bird population metrics, movement patterns, and fruit removal rates collected via mist-netting, radio-tracking, and fruiting trees observations. These correlational approaches may be complemented by an experiment in which nest boxes are placed in a range of habitats to determine if the availability of nesting holes limit bird populations in agricultural areas. Avian seed-dispersal data can also be evaluated in relation to forest structure, elevation, and the thermic environment to investigate its effect on seed deposition and seedling recruitment. To understand factors limiting vegetative regeneration, students can study the diversity and abundance of seeds arriving in seed traps; the effects of seed density, location, and species composition of dispersed seeds on seedling growth, survival, and demography; and impacts of herbivory through field-based experiments.<br/><br/>To better understand how tree cover relates to human well-being, students will investigate the role of forest cover in moderating ambient temperatures and how the thermal environment directly (dehydration, heat stress) and indirectly (work patterns, food security) influences human well-being. Participants can also evaluate how land cover, gender, and market access may influence dietary patterns and human nutritional status. This will involve data collection on macronutrient and micronutrient intakes as well as anthropometric measurements of adults and children (height, weight, circumferences, and body composition). <br/><br/>Results from this interdisciplinary research are expected to elucidate how integration of biodiversity into agriculture systems may impact both ecosystem function and human health, thereby informing how growing human populations, increased deforestation, and a warming climate may affect our planet and society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the increased frequency and severity of wildfires in forested watersheds  are adversely impacting  downstream water quality due to the exports of sediments, nutrients, and dissolved organic matter. Heat from wildfires initiates and catalyzes a series of chemical reactions in soil organic matter that result in the formation of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM). In a wildfire impacted watershed, PyOM has the potential to impact surface water quality, aquatic biogeochemical processes, and the operation of downstream water treatment plants. The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate the chemical composition, environmental fate and reactivity, and timing of PyOM release from a wildfire impacted watershed. To advance this goal, the Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to carry out an integrated laboratory and field research program to 1) characterize the chemical composition of PyOM using optical spectroscopy and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry, 2) evaluate the environmental fate of PyOM during photodegradation and biodegradation, and 3) monitor the timing of PyOM export from a wildfire-impacted watershed with in-situ optical sensors. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge and data to advance the assessment and evaluation of the environmental fate and transport of PyOM in forested watersheds and its potential impact on downstream water quality. Additional benefits to society will be achieved through outreach and education activities including the mentoring of one graduate student at Texas A&M University and one graduate student at Washington State University.<br/><br/>Wildfires can drastically change the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that is exported from burned watersheds to downstream surface water systems due to the formation of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM). The presence of PyOM in wildfire-impacted watersheds has the potential to impact aquatic biogeochemical processes and the removal of organic matter during drinking water treatment. The goal of this project is to evaluate the chemical composition, environmental stability, and timing of dissolved PyOM export from wildfire-impacted watersheds. The specific objectives of the research are to: (1) Evaluate the differences in chemical compositions between background DOM and PyOM; (2) Assess the fate of PyOM during biodegradation, photodegradation, and photobiodegradation; and (3) Evaluate the timing of PyOM release from a wildfire-impacted watershed using in situ optical sensors. PyOM generated from water leaching experiments of laboratory-heated soils will be characterized by elemental composition, optical measurements, and ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry. A multi-year field campaign will evaluate the temporal dynamics of PyOM release from a wildfire-impacted watershed using in situ optical sensors. The successful completion of this research has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new insight and data from both lab and field studies to advance the fundamental understanding of the fate and transport of PyOM in forested watersheds as climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of wildfires. To implement the educational and training goals of this project, the PIs will leverage existing programs at their respective institutions to integrate the findings from this research into a K-12 teacher training program (Spark!

The motivation comes from the ways animals achieve efficient locomotion in their habitats by varying body shape and mechanical properties as a result of evolution over millions of years.  Based on prior numerical results, the investigators hypothesize that highly adaptable locomotion can be achieved when given enough complexity in terms of shape deformation and mechanical properties.  Current bioinspired soft robots, however, have limited capability to investigate such hypothesis. One key goal in this proposal is to develop innovative soft robotic platforms to study, for the first time, these numerical findings. The planned research has the potential to significantly enhance the functionality, adaptability, and versality of high-dimensional soft robots. The broader impact would be significant in several areas where soft robots have shown promise, particularly in inspection operations and search-and-rescue missions.

Despite ongoing efforts, clinicians have a bare-bones understanding of these disorders, and hence, a limited ability to treat them. From an analytics perspective, clinical neuroscience is a field of high-dimensional datasets, small sample sizes, massive patient variability, and most importantly, an arguable lack of ground truth information. These challenges have led to a trade-off between the interpretability of a given model and its generalizability to new data. At one extreme, classical statistics allows us to formulate and test interpretable hypotheses about the brain, but it cannot make patient-specific generalizations. At the other extreme, conventional machine learning algorithms are geared towards patient generalizability but rarely illuminate a brain-basis for the prediction. This CAREER program will develop a Coupled Network Optimization (CNO) framework that balances the two analytical extremes. The resulting algorithms will reveal interpretable system-level interactions in the brain that can predict the behavioral and cognitive deficits of a given disorder. In parallel, the investigators have formulated a diverse range of educational initiatives to train the next generation of interdisciplinary data scientists.<br/><br/>Mathematically, the CNO framework estimates a low-dimensional network manifold for functional neuroimaging data. The elemental bases of this manifold will correspond to interpretable group-level features, whereas the patient-specific projections will capture predictive information. The technical exploration of this award will unfold in three modular stages, each of which tackles an open challenge in the field. Thrust I will improve the CNO interpretability by imposing a patient-specific graph topology to guide the salient functional interactions. Thrust II will advance the CNO generalizability by introducing nonlinear and nonparametric regression models. Finally, Thrust III will leverage an equivalent Bayesian representation to tackle the challenges of multisite analysis. The CNO framework will be applied to two markedly different application testbeds: a large multi-site repository of neuroimaging, behavioral and genetic data for autism, and a focused clinical trial of functional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Beyond the scientific goals, this award includes a three-pronged educational plan to build strong technical foundations, foster interdisciplinary collaborations through engagement and communication, and finally, motivate young women into the STEM fields.

It is not fully understood how the diversity in root architecture contributes to crop yields or plant biomass in part because roots are buried underground and difficult to study. This research takes a quantitative approach to analyze the wide diversity of root architectures. Bean roots grown under experimental conditions will be imaged and the resulting data will be used to create new mathematical and computational tools to discern causes of root variability. Combined with genomic information, the analytical tools will identify genetic elements underlying root shapes in response to environmental and genetic variation. The research will point to new opportunities for breeding targets in crops such as bean and extended to maize. The research also couples with an education program that integrates computation with plant research, thus addressing the critical national need for a computationally trained plant science workforce. The novel tools will be publicly available and deployed using national cyberinfrastructure: further the technologies will be integrated into two courses that enable basic science and computational biology within an experiential learning environment. A new student award is implemented through the Plant Center and the Georgia Informatics Institute to highlight advances attained by working at the computational and plant science interface. Together, the integration of science and education sets forth a path for fast dissemination of results into breeding programs. <br/><br/>After decades of research on plant roots it is still a mystery how and why root architecture arises in seemingly endless variations of shapes. The research introduces the phenotypic spectrum as a new quantitative theory that extends the established concept of plasticity by a new dimension. The phenotypic spectrum of one genotype consists of distinct root architecture types, each of which is hypothesized to be associated with a different plasticity curve across environments. Theoretically, the phenotypic spectrum emerges for a population of one genotype if all elementary geometric measurements at all locations within each individual root system are taken and each individual is summarized by a whole root descriptor. Descriptors with similar characteristics correspond to one architecture type. Hence, the spectrum is not observable with current phenotyping tools that capture only one location in a root system per trait. Quantifying the phenotypic spectrum demands the development of unprecedented whole root descriptors and simulation techniques to capture the differences in the 3D spatial organization of the whole root architecture. In doing so, a new combination of differential geometry and imaging approaches as well as a newly developed statistical analysis is proposed. The experiments will provide an understanding of how to describe and evaluate the interplay of different root architecture types in the greenhouse and the field by linking both with the developed descriptors. The educational goal is to increase the number of researchers at the interface of computational and plant sciences through two courses using the developed tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, when the size scale of contact between soft surfaces becomes small, liquid-like characteristics arise and it is unclear if solid or liquid descriptions are appropriate, limiting the design of soft surfaces. This award supports fundamental research that overcomes current challenges in measuring and describing friction of soft materials at the microscale. In addition to promoting scientific advancement, this new knowledge is important for a broad range of applications towards national health and prosperity. For example, insights from this work are expected to afford design guidelines for soft biomaterials, resulting in advanced biotechnologies and healthcare. Knowledge is also expected to offer routes to designing low-friction coatings to mitigating energy losses due to frictional drag for manufacturing or transportation applications. Additionally, the project will provide opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students in the cross-disciplinary areas of micromechanics, surface science, and materials science, through research in the PI's lab, with a focus on underrepresented students in STEM.<br/><br/>Macroscale friction of soft materials is often assumed to be mediated by microscale contact points, arising from surface asperities. Therefore, universally predicting friction arguably requires understanding the behavior of single microscale junctions. Although research has consistently shown that friction is related to normal loading, contact area, dwell time, and velocity, it is unclear how it is described as the length scale is decreased. At small scales, near the so-called elastocapillary length, surface tension becomes critical and liquid-like characteristics are expected, leading to large out-of-plane deformations and capillarity. To characterize how the above parameters relate to friction force and surface deformation, the PI will utilize an experimental method that combines lateral force measurements using an AFM with in-situ imaging of cross-sections via confocal microscopy. A model silicone will be used, allowing for systematic tuning of the modulus and elastocapillary length. Experiments that control the normal loading, velocity, dwell time, and interfacial tension, while measuring the contact area, out-of-plane deformations, and friction force, are anticipated to reveal when friction is described by solid and/or liquid-like mechanics. A map of static friction thresholds and kinetic friction mechanisms, such as smooth sliding or stick slip, will be generated and new knowledge will be applied to more comprehensively predict micro and macroscale friction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the aye-aye moves along the surface of a tree, it taps the wood with its unusual middle finger while keeping its nose near the tree?s surface and its large ears bent forward to detect deep cavities in tree bark that contains the worms they eat. This behavior is very similar to what is done in nondestructive evaluation (NDE), a process where an active acoustic wave is generated and the response from a material (e.g., echo) is used to characterize material properties as well as to detect and evaluate defects (e.g., cavities). The aye-aye?s tap-scanning behavior is unique, making it particularly valuable for creating new NDE technologies. The main goal of Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) research is to understand the exceptional near-field acoustic-based sensing and detection capabilities of aye-ayes, inspiring the creation of new NDE methods. This grant will help support research that will provide a foundation for developing bio-inspired NDE methods, both promoting science and ensuring the safety of our nation?s aging infrastructures. Reliable NDE methods are needed to inspect aging structures, such as bridges, pipelines, power plants, and aircrafts, as well as provide quality control assessments for complex manufactured components. Therefore, this research will benefit both the U.S. economy and promoting the safety of U.S. society by circumventing catastrophic failures of critical aging infrastructures. <br/><br/>The principal hypothesis of this research is that the exceptional near-field auditory system of aye-ayes has resulted from two marvelous adaptations: (i) shape and morphology of the aye-aye?s pinnae, ear canals, and head have adapted to enhance the noise reduction and reception of sound reflected from tapping and increase the near-field acoustic beam resolution and (ii) morphological features of the aye-aye?s middle finger have adapted to provide unique acoustic cues during tap-scanning. To test these hypotheses, the research team will perform bio-mimetic and numerical studies. First, a robotic platform will be used to mimic the aye-aye?s middle finger during tap-scanning. The effects of the pinna, head, and ear canal in enhancing the aye-aye?s acoustic near-field sensing will be evaluated experimentally.

That feat will be replicated by this project through the development of both artificial neurons and synapses on the same materials platform.  This will allow us to create systems that can emulate the capacity and speed of the human brain for pattern matching, beating current systems that are bulkier, slower and more power hungry. This will revolutionize the field of machine learning and create devices where the machine-learning hardware is close to the sensor, giving rise to systems that are currently impossible to create. Neuromorphic circuits based on these devices include smart wearables that can monitor health biometrics and issue first level triage for elderly people alone at home. They can improve autonomous driving for terrestrial vehicles. These circuits will be especially useful for spacecrafts and space rovers because these ultra-light circuits will not be a bottleneck to the rocket's payload. Fast pattern recognition abilities through these deep neural networks will enhance speech recognition in portable electronics and improve traffic analysis and control systems. In collaboration with Central Florida STEM Alliance (CFSA) program, underrepresented minorities from local community colleges will be provided hands-on research opportunities in the lab of the PI. Regular video lab tours to underrepresented K-12 students and week-long lab experience for two selected K-12 students annually will foster their interest in STEM education. Banners highlighting key aspects of this research will be displayed at the Orlando Science Center for general public awareness. These efforts will lead the electronics industry to invest in Florida through the Florida High Technology Corridor, creating opportunities for engineers in the state.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The objective of this proposal is to develop scalable monolithically integrated artificial neurons and synapses using all-two-dimensional (all-2D) graphene/MoS2/graphene memristive heterostructures for neuromorphic computing. In these heterostructures graphene acts as the electrodes and MoS2 as the switching medium. Volatile resistive switching observed in vertically-standing sheets of MoS2 will be harnessed to realize integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons, and the stochastic nature of their firing will be investigated. Artificial synapses with sub-picojoules of energy requirement per switching event will be developed using the multi-level non-volatile switching in horizontal MoS2 sheets. The mechanisms behind this intriguing phenomenon of volatile resistive switching in vertical MoS2 sheets versus non-volatile switching in horizontal MoS2 sheets will be investigated using electrical and materials characterization techniques. The necessity of graphene electrodes in the heterostructure will be justified. Through engineering of the heterostructure design, the performance of the artificial neurons and synapses will be optimized to create stochastic resistive-switching IF neurons and low-power synapses which will be integrated monolithically. The advantage of mechanical flexibility of graphene and MoS2 will be exploited to fabricate and test these neuromorphic devices on a flexible platform. The proposed research program aims at bringing together two emerging research areas cohesively into a cutting edge technology. While 2D materials have immense prospects in succeeding silicon within the von Neumann paradigm, non-von Neumann approaches have always dealt with conventional materials. This transformative research would bring together the best of both these worlds. The use of large-area 2D materials will enhance the practical realization of these exotic devices. Ultra-low power operation of graphene/MoS2/graphene artificial synapses with sparse firing graphene/MoS2/graphene artificial neurons will provide for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern coral reef science encompasses broad scientific fields, including biology, geology, chemistry, and physics, necessitating a cross-disciplinary effort to understand these complex ecosystems and how they will respond to local and global anthropogenic change. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of scientists to bridge diverse scientific disciplines to gain a transdisciplinary understanding of coral reef ecosystems. To reach this goal, we will offer a series of three Advanced Science Institutes (ASI) in Australia that will foster the collaborative environment necessary to address the existing and emergent needs of the coral reef scientific and conservation communities. We will model these graduate-level courses after approaches developed for Earth Systems science, which combine traditional disciplines to build a holistic understanding of Earth as a complex and adaptive system. By incorporating a team of domestic and international experts from various disciplines in coral reef science, these ASIs will help to address the current shortage in transdisciplinary researchers equipped to deal with the complex problems facing coral reefs and other marine ecosystems. Training through these ASIs will address specific and measurable societal needs by improving the quality of STEM education for U.S.-based, marine science graduate students, ultimately enhancing the science and technology available to inform public environmental policy. A key priority will be to recruit U.S.-based graduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups (women, persons with disabilities, and minorities) to promote diversity and equity in STEM research fields. By meeting these goals, we will increase the competitiveness of American STEM education programs in the international market, foster international partnerships in research and education between the U.S. and Australia, and enhance the American workforce in STEM industry, agency, and academia.<br/><br/>Given the unprecedented pressure from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors that coral reefs and the communities that depend on them face, proactive management and novel techniques at the margins of terrestrial and marine ecosystems are urgently needed to counteract the degradation of these ecosystems. As a response to the shortage of broadly trained, transdisciplinary coral reef scientists, these ASI workshops in far-north Queensland, Australia will develop a systems-based approach to target student training in a range of disciplines related to coral reef science and conservation. Students will have the unique opportunity to interact with experts in a range of fields, including, but not limited to, ecology, biogeochemistry, physiology, animal behavior, molecular biology, and environmental social science. Students will first learn about socio-ecological resilience and anthropogenic impacts on natural systems at the School for Field Studies (SFS), Centre for Rainforest Studies (CRS) in the Atherton Tablelands (7 days), the only place in the world where land and ocean-based UNESCO World Heritage Sites meet (Daintree Rainforest and Great Barrier Reef). The group will then travel to the Lizard Island Research Station (LIRS), a state-of-the-art, island-based research facility in the northern Great Barrier Reef (14 days), where students will learn from and be guided through independent research projects by a diverse group of American and Australian coral reef scientists. Through lectures, class work, field immersions, and independent projects, these ASIs will engage students in hands-on research that fosters a transdisciplinary understanding of coral reef ecosystems. This pioneering program will teach students how holistic approaches are critical to addressing human impacts on ecosystems while preparing them to address the next big-picture scientific problems. The international location will provide students with valuable networking and professional development, broadening the students´ career opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as the size of the graph continues to grow, learning, mining and computing such gigantic graphs become ineffective, impractical, and potentially dire. Fortunately, Graph Sampling and Random Walk can dramatically reduce the size of the original graphs, while still capturing the desired properties for downstream graph analytics tasks. But a comprehensive system that can perform graph sampling and random walk on real-world trillion-edge graphs at an acceptable speed is absent. This research pioneers the effort of uniting various graph sampling and random walk algorithms behind a user-friendly framework that can take advantage of world-class Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing facilities, including the future exascale ones, to rapidly handle trillion-edge graphs. This project contributes to the U.S. national goal of increasing participation in science and engineering, which is crucial to America?s success in addressing global challenges, building a stronger and more diversified workforce, and meeting the needs of the global innovation economy. This project produces a high-performance software library that serves as a foundational tool for fellow science and engineering practitioners from academia, national laboratories and industry. With a commitment to helping K-12, undergraduate, female, and Underrepresented Minority (URM) populations in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field through the interesting investment and rewarding education plan, this project lays out a comprehensive road map to prepare the next-generation high-performance graph analytics professional workers and researchers. This project revamps and creates core courses in both graduate and undergraduate levels for the PI's home department. To benefit the society at large, this project disseminates the project data, software, and publications to the broader research community at http://personal.stevens.edu/~hliu77/gsrw.html.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to make graph sampling and random walk fast, scalable and user-friendly. Towards that end, this career proposal advocates algorithm and system co-designed researches. First, this research introduces novel update and construction designs for transition probability of various major Monte Carlo methods that are essential for fast sampling. Second, to fully unleash the potential of GPUs, this project formulates the key primitive into problems that can take advantage of general, and reserved tensor and ray tracing cores on GPUs. Third, based upon the asynchronous processing nature of graph sampling and random walk, this research exploits Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-assisted task and partition adaptive scheduling mechanism to reduce the data transfers for scalable trillion-edge graph sampling and random walk. Last but not the least, this career research delivers a bias-centric framework, which offers end users expressiveness to program not only a variety of exiting GSRW algorithms but also future ones, and simplicity by hiding the aforementioned advanced optimization techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While it is evident that primate crania (skulls) have evolved to accommodate larger brain sizes, the mechanistic underpinnings of these modifications are not fully understood. In this project, the investigators will test long-held assumptions about the mechanical role of brain growth on cranial morphology (shape). Using a novel tissue engineering approach to simulate static tensile loads during brain expansion, the osteogenic (bone producing) potential of calvarial, basicranial and mandibular non-sutural bone cells will be examined in a murine model. The research will advance knowledge about the developmental and cellular underpinnings of cranial morphology, provide comparative mammalian data that will inform studies in primate and hominin evolution, and potentially inform clinical research in regenerative medicine. The project will foster interdisciplinary approaches to research and education involving members of under-represented groups in STEM. It will benefit a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students and undergraduates as well as STEM teachers and students, all of whom will participate in presentations and outreach at public and local institutions. <br/><br/>Due to its location at the interface of neural and facial skulls, elevated flexion of the mammalian cranial base is depicted as the mechanical consequence of an increasingly globular brain. However, most experimental evidence indicates that calvarial bony tissues are largely buffered against variation in mechanical stimuli. In contrast, the dura mater is known to be affected by tensile forces during brain expansion and induces growth of overlying sutural bone. Surprisingly, there is little evidence about the extent to which neural forces and pro-osteogenic signaling by the dura affect the development of non-sutural bone in the cranial base and vault. A major goal of this project is to detail site-specific and age-related variation in the osteogenic potential and mechanosensitivity of connective tissues in the growing skull, using the responses of mandibular bone cells as a baseline to evaluate calvarial and basicranial cells. The investigators will assess if bone formation in the cranial vault and base is affected by pro-osteogenic signaling in the underlying dura mater. This research is transformative in its integrative perspective and novel use of tissue engineering methods. Experimental data on how the dura mater modulates bone formation in the skull is key for understanding important questions, including the adaptive nature of cranial vault thickness and circumorbital form in primates. The presence of site-specific variation in craniomandibular mechanosensitivity would also emphasize that variation in intrinsic mechanisms of bone formation should be incorporated into future work on hard-tissue adaptations in diverse mammals, including cranial and limb elements with more marked bony responses. The project outcomes will therefore contribute to both theoretical and analytical advances in biological anthropology, organismal biology, mechanobiology and pathobiology.

This is especially true in tropical regions of the world, where the number of undescribed and poorly known species is highest and biodiversity is most severely threatened. This research aims to contribute to documentation of Earth?s plant diversity by studying the diversity of ferns in Colombia, one of the most species-rich countries on Earth. In this work, the researchers will document fern diversity by conducting surveys in remote parts of the country that have been poorly explored by scientists, as well as studying specimens of ferns in museum collections. This project will improve our understanding of how many fern species exist in Colombia, where they occur, and how many of them are threatened with extinction. This project will also result in the description of species that are new to science and provide insights into the origins of plant diversity by reconstructing the evolutionary history of ferns through analysis of DNA sequences. An important contribution of this work will be the creation of a freely accessible online database that will organize data on ferns in Colombia and help future researchers to study these plants. This project will also provide training for two graduate students and more than a dozen undergraduate students in biodiversity research and will improve scientific collaboration. Findings of this research will be shared with the public through partnerships with schools, freely available online videos, and displays at a botanical garden in the United States. <br/><br/>This research will document diversity of ferns in Colombia through a unified taxonomic and evolutionary context using a multi-faceted approach. First, gaps in the current understanding of species distributions in Colombia will be addressed through field expeditions to understudied regions of Colombia that are predicted to harbor high levels of fern diversity, complemented by targeted study of herbarium specimens at major herbaria. Second, in order to improve accessibility of data on Colombia ferns, resources for an existing online database will be bolstered, producing a data-rich, publicly available, specimen-driven taxonomic resource for fern diversity research in the American tropics. This resource will include a searchable specimen database, multi-entry keys to families and genera, and specimen-driven national and regional checklists. Third, to better understand Colombian fern diversity within an evolutionary context, genomic resources will be generated for all fern species in Colombia, including a DNA and leaf-tissue bank for all collections, ploidy estimates, and target capture sequence data to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses.

A critical component of these forecasts is understanding how variation in limiting environmental factors such as food, water, or shelter drive population fluctuations. In the absence of specific data on these factors, ecologists must use the properties of the observed variation in the data to make projections about future risk. In ecology, these forecasts often make simplifying assumptions about the underlying biology that may impact their accuracy. The project will integrate new mathematical ideas and models with empirical field observations to study the properties of populations that experience large fluctuations, allowing the PIs to test fundamental assumptions about how populations are structured. This work will focus on populations that experience regular cycles, a common phenomenon arising through factors such as competition for resources among individuals or predator-prey interactions. This work will improve both the tools used in the management and conservation of wildlife and the understanding of how external factors drive variation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The mathematical ideas and models developed in this project will use techniques similar to those that economists use to project stock market fluctuations or meteorologists use to predict paths of hurricanes; thus, the results may have important implications for many areas of general societal interest. <br/><br/>Emerging work has shown that universal laws describe the fluctuations of biological systems, regardless of the biological scale at which these processes operate. A key prediction of these laws is that the fluctuations of many biological systems will increase monotonically in response to increases in extrinsic variability, often termed ?environmental noise?. However, this scaling has only been studied in linearized models that are valid when fluctuations are small. When populations exhibit larger fluctuations, the assumptions underlying this theory break down. This project will develop the mathematics needed to study the variance scaling properties in nonlinear biological systems subject to increased environmental variation. In particular, the PIs will study the scaling properties of extrinsic noise in nonlinear biological systems focusing on how increases in the magnitude of external perturbations may drive declines in total system variance. The goal is to understand how nonlinearities in ecological systems may lead to robust or sublinear responses to environmental noise. The research scope includes developing mathematical theory to model how environmental variation interacts with highly nonlinear population dynamics, mainly for single species.  The PIs will also develop the statistical approaches to better detect the signal of the predicted variance scaling relationships from empirical population surveys. This work will be the first to determine how increases in external variability can drive increases in the stability of biological systems, an essential step in constructing a more nuanced description of how nonlinear biological systems interact with and respond to noisy environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experimentation is ubiquitous, pervasive, and often necessary to understand the relationship between cause and effect. Every time one learns how to interact with a new phone or try to understand why our cars will not start, one informally experiments. As individuals, people experiment for themselves, but organizations also experiment to understand the effects of products, policies or design decisions for many customers, citizens and users. As the world is increasingly mediated by software through people's phones, smart devices, and social media platforms, one's ability to experiment is both driven and limited by software. Unfortunately, software is not often written with support for experimentation in mind. This severely limits one's ability to understand complex cause and effect relationships, such as the role that a news feed algorithm play on users' understanding of current events. This project will develop tools and techniques for making experimentation in software easier and more transparent, without sacrificing flexibility or correctness. <br/><br/>At present experimentation in software has no unified framework; while there are libraries, configuration languages, and services that can provide limited support for experimentation, there are few end-to-end systems in the style of e.g., logging frameworks. Instead, developers must typically write bespoke software, resulting in systems that are (a) tailored to a specific task and (b) disconnected from hypotheses and analyses. This project will produce a high-level domain-specific language (DSL) for experimentation that enforces constraints on hypotheses, analyses, and treatment assignment according to the underlying principles of experimental design. Experiments written in this language will be correct by construction vis a vis consistency of hypotheses and treatment assignments with respect to their identifiable effects. The team will then integrate the experimentation DSL into legacy socio-technical software for education, leveraging existing support for gradual typing to implement an orthogonal type system for experimental interventions. To evaluate these tools and promote continued research around formal methods approaches to the experimentation-analysis pipeline, the team will build a publicly available searchable experiment repository. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Formal Methods in the Field and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elastic fibers may regenerate during pregnancy to accommodate the growing fetus.  This also benefits the mother during postpartum healing. However, the ability of these elastic fibers to regenerate may decrease as the mother ages.  This may cause complications such as pelvic floor disorders. This award will support fundamental research to better understand how elastic fiber regeneration in the female reproductive system changes during postpartum healing and with aging. This award will also develop a new mathematical model to describe how elastic fiber regeneration controls tissue function. These elastic fibers are critical to the function of most soft biological tissues. Therefore, this model may also be used to better understand the mechanical behavior of other soft tissues that elastic fibers, such as the lungs, blood vessels, or skin. Further, the mathematical model will tell us if the results we learn by studying postpartum healing can be used to identify therapies that aim to treat, and ultimately prevent, medical problems that arise due to disrupted elastic fibers in other tissues. Research findings from this project will be incorporated into a tabletop board game, teaching modules for K-12 education, and into undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineering courses.<br/><br/>Elastic fibers are critical for biological tissue homeostasis as they not only provide resilience and recoil but may also physically tether cells and other proteins within biological tissues that dictate function. Prior work suggests that regeneration and remodeling of elastic fibers during postpartum healing is critical to maintaining reproductive tissue health. Elastic fiber composition and relative arrangement to other cells and proteins during postpartum healing and aging is unknown. Therefore, this award will determine how elastic fibers dictate the evolving biological tissue microstructure and mechanical function during aging and postpartum healing. In particular, the evolving orientation and relative arrangement of elastic fibers with respect to cells and other biological proteins will be quantified and directly incorporated into a new mathematical model to better understand how elastic fiber regeneration dictates tissue contractility and function. This will be accomplished by: 1) Formulating and validating a biomechanical model that describes the vaginal extracellular matrix, mechanics, and contractility with increasing maternal age; and 2) Determining the effect of maternal age on elastic fiber regeneration and evolving mechanical properties during postpartum healing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, two enigmatic dome-shaped structures called the ""Large Shear Wave Velocity Provinces"" (or LLSVPs) rise from the base of the mantle to around 1000 km above, one beneath Africa and the other beneath the Pacific Ocean.  Seismic waves that emanate from earthquakes sometimes travel through these LLSVPs and are slowed down when they enter these structures.   It is still unclear why this might be the case: LLSVPs could be hotter (and thus more buoyant) than their surroundings, or they could be chemically distinct (and likely denser) than their surroundings.  Both suggest fundamental differences in how the mantle flows over millions of years and therefore how it influences tectonic plate motions and the related natural disasters.  The PIs plan to, for the first time, combine information from traditional seismic data sets but also measurements from special types of seismic waves and earth tides to shed new light on the buoyancy of these LLSVPs.  The special type of seismic waves are called Stoneley modes and are vibrations trapped along the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and the earth tides are the twice-daily deformation of the solid Earth under gravitational forces from the Sun and Moon.  This award will support the training of two graduate students at UC Berkeley and two female PIs, one of whom is an early career scientist and new faculty member at UC Berkeley.  The models developed in this project will be made available as part of a webpage specifically developed for this project, as well as through the Incorporated Research Institution for Seismology (IRIS) facility. They will be used in undergraduate workshops at UC Berkeley and at the interdisciplinary CIDER workshop geared towards senior graduate students and early career scientists.<br/><br/>Within the last two years, independent studies have presented seemingly contradictory results on the density structure of the large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) imaged by seismic tomography in the earth's deep mantle.  In particular, one study used a variety of seismological data (normal mode splitting, seismic travel time and waveform data), and another, semi-diurnal earth tide data, concluding that a significant part of the LLSVPs represent regions of excess density pointing to the source of the LLSVP anomalies being dominated by chemical heterogeneity.  In contrast, a study featuring measurements of Earth's Stoneley modes concluded the opposite, implying that the source of LLSVP anomalies are in large part thermal.  Both conclusions paint a very different picture of mantle convection: the former implies that the LLSVPs are potentially sluggish upwellings or stabilized piles, while the latter implies a more energetic mode of mantle circulation.  In this project, the investigators will combine these different geodetic and seismic datasets - which have different depth sensitivities to elastic and density structure - to establish whether previous results can be reconciled under the hypothesis that the excess density in LLSVPs may be confined to a thin layer (~200 km or less) above the CMB.  In doing so, they will investigate further trade-offs with shear and compressional wave speed structure, anisotropy, attenuation, as well as CMB topography and possible structure in the outermost core. First, they will consider a combination of existing global seismic waveform, tide and normal mode splitting data, including Stoneley mode data, and perform inversions for structure in the deepest mantle, using the classical first order mode perturbation formalism for modeling splitting data. They will implement both an optimization and a trans-dimensional Monte Carlo inversion method for this purpose. This, in large part, will act as a guide to prepare for the more advanced inversions to be undertaken in the next stage, while yielding interesting intermediate results.  In the second stage, after completing their own dataset of normal mode spectra, they will consider a more rigorous theoretical approach and directly invert mode spectra, together with long period waveform and tide data (complemented by newly acquired data) for density and velocity structure in the vicinity of the CMB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Explosive growth in model complexity and data size along with the surging demands of MLaaS is already resulting in substantial increases in computational resource and energy requirements. Unfortunately, existing MLaaS systems have poor resource management and limited support for user specified performance and cost requirements, exacerbating waste in computing resources and energy. This project aims to utilize the unique features of MLaaS to design efficient, automated, and user-centric MLaaS systems. This approach will significantly reduce resource waste and shorten the model design cycles through a variety of novel optimization approaches and by eliminating candidate models that fail to meet model serving latency and target accuracy. To support complete MLaaS workflow, this project will also develop MLaaS model serving methodologies that can meet service level latency requirements with minimum resource consumption using intelligent autoscaling.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to tremendously reduce the resource and energy consumptions as well as the carbon footprint associated with the fast-growing societal demands in machine learning and cloud computing.

The East African Rift is among the best places to study the influences of Earth processes on the evolution of mammals. Here the region?s geologic and climate histories, including the formation of the rift system that is the cradle of humankind, are preserved in sedimentary rocks in a unique way. The team will investigate these sediments, and the fossils they contain, to gain insight into ancient climate and habitats that record the emergence of humans, their primate ancestors, and African mammals over the last 25 million years. Our research will explore relationships between tectonics, climate, and mammal evolution in the Turkana Basin, Kenya using integrated field, laboratory, and modeling studies. New and existing data will be combined to study the links between rift development, climate change, and their respective roles in vegetation and mammal evolution. The team will produce a tectonic model that reconstructs rift evolution in this region of East Africa for the past 25 million years, and the tectonic model will be integrated with climate-vegetation models of equal or better resolution. Independent geological, geochemical, paleoecological, and paleontological data will be used to validate these model outputs to distinguish the influences of tectonics and climate on the evolution of Turkana ecosystems and mammals. The project will also train several postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and provide them with the opportunity to conduct field work in Kenya.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to test multiple hypotheses centered on questions regarding the complex interplay of tectonics and climate on the evolution of mammals and late Cenozoic terrestrial ecosystems.  The team have designed an integrated approach to explore the roles of continental rifting and global and regional climate on the evolution of primates and other mammals in the Turkana Basin from 28 to 5 million year ago. A time-dependent, kinematic and dynamic tectonic model for East Africa will be used to explore evolution of the entire Rift System. The tectonic model will be integrated with an Earth system model coupled to a dynamic vegetation model to test our hypotheses. The model outputs will be validated with new proxy data from the Turkana Basin that includes lithostratigraphy, radiometric dating, clumped isotope thermometry, plant wax biomarkers, enamel isotopes, paleobotany, dental microwear, and ecometrics, that taken together, enable independent reconstruction of the climate, tectonic, and faunal evolution in the region. Our multidisciplinary, multi-institutional project includes training opportunities for the next generation of scientists, including training of three graduate students, four postdocs, and at least 11 undergraduates.

Automated vehicle technologies have emerged as a promising mechanism to prevent these crashes, to increase personal mobility, and to lower emissions. Delivery on these promises has been limited by a growing public concern over the safety of automated vehicles, particularly during transfers of control between automated systems and human drivers. Trust between human drivers and automated systems is a central concern during these interactions. Prior research in human-automation trust has established that the safety and performance of human-machine systems requires calibrated trust?a state where a human driver?s trust in an automated system matches the system?s capabilities. Trust calibration in automated vehicles is an elusive challenge because of limitations in trust measurement and methods that illuminate the impact of technology design decisions on trust and driver behavior. This project will promote the progress of science and advance the national health by advancing an understanding of human-automation trust. Specifically, the project will address the limitations of existing trust measures, model trust and driver behavior, and determine how autonomous vehicles that incorporate trust calibration models can influence dynamic trust and driving behavior. The approach will provide guidelines and technology design recommendations that could significantly reduce the human lives lost and injuries associated with vehicle crashes. Broader impacts of the work include undergraduate and graduate course development, focused research opportunities for underrepresented undergraduates at Texas A&M University, as well as student-leg outreach activities to local high school students.<br/><br/>The project will consist of three phases designed to (1) develop a novel and objective measure of dynamic trust using real-time measures of neural activation during AV interactions, (2) model driver interactions with automated vehicles along the spectrum of dynamic trust, and (3) validate the trust measure and driver behavior model with a trust calibration intervention-based driving simulation experiment. The measure development will be supported by data from human subjects studies in which drivers in a simulated automated vehicle will encounter a series of realistic driving scenarios designed to modulate trust in the system while physiological, neurological, behavioral, and subjective measures are collected. Neurological data will be analyzed with regression and connectivity analysis methods to identify correlates with trust states validated by the physiological and subjective measures. The correlates will be used to train and test novel process models of driver trust and responses to automation events that extend existing driver decision-making and control frameworks. The models and measure will be validated in a second driving simulation study including a trust calibration intervention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, there are no comprehensive, clearly laid-out best practices that can guide researchers, Indigenous communities, and museum personnel in designing ethically sound and socially engaged 3D heritage preservation projects. The use of 3D technologies for heritage preservation and providing public access to digital 3D collections is well-established in the European context. While there have been several robust efforts on digitizing European national heritage, in the U.S. context, the focus often involves work with Indigenous heritage, instantly placing 3D projects into a post-colonial research paradigm with a complex set of ethical ramifications. This research examines emerging thoughts from the European context and connects them with best practices in digital Indigenous data management to identify practices that contribute to cultures of academic integrity that are inclusive of all stakeholder voices. This work fosters ethical cultures of STEM through the development of a comprehensive Responsible Conduct of Research guiding document that can be adapted to address culture-specific Indigenous perspectives as well as project-specific challenges in future 3D heritage preservation endeavors. <br/><br/>Project goals are accomplished through workshops and virtual collaborations that bring together researchers, Indigenous community members, and heritage preservation professionals with previous experience in the responsible management, protection, and sharing of Indigenous digital data and the use of 3D technology for heritage preservation. The collaboratively produced guidelines outline ethical considerations that can be used in developing: 1) partnerships with origin/descendant communities, 2) institution- and collection-specific museum policies on using 3D technology, 3) Tribal policies for culturally appropriate use of 3D technologies, and 4) training material and curriculum that integrates with other research compliance regulations pertaining to heritage preservation. The project explores the questions that have emerged through previous experiences using 3D technologies to preserve Indigenous ancestral heritage. These questions include the factors contributing to developing ethically sound 3D heritage preservation projects; the  practices useful in 3D projects to foster a culture of integrity that equally engages academic and Indigenous perspectives; consideration for what constitutes Responsible Conduct of Research in using 3D technologies to preserve Indigenous cultural heritage; and addressing practice-based questions that contribute to understanding ethical challenges in digitally preserving and presenting Indigenous heritage. The project situates 3D modeling and heritage representation as part of the larger discourse on decolonizing core methodologies in museum management and anthropological collection practices. Results from this work can be adapted to training future researchers and digital heritage management professionals and creating meaningful partnerships in heritage documentation. This research cultivates cultures of academic integrity by informing heritage management policy on the critical importance of heritage ethics for the creation and management of 3D digitization projects involving Indigenous collections.

Tools for solving these problems are integral components of high-level programming languages such as MATLAB and Julia, and are frequently taught as basic programming constructs in courses on machine learning, statistics, and data science. Improved algorithms for these problems can provide faster, more robust, and easier-to-use algorithmic primitives, which would in turn enable computing on larger and more diverse data sets in areas such as data mining, image processing, scientific computing, and network science. The proposed works will actively involve graduate students, and their results will be incorporated into courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels. The project will also support the PI's long-time involvement with algorithmic problem-solving outreach activities, with a focus on making these activities more accessible to underrepresented groups, and institutionalizing the involvement of graduate students.<br/> <br/>The problems that this project proposes to study, linear system solvers and optimization on graphs, are some of the most well-studied problems in algorithm design. Previous work on these topics led to many widely-used algorithms and data structures. The main approach of this project is motivated by progress on combining numerical and combinatorial algorithmic primitives through the graph Laplacian matrix, known as the `Laplacian paradigm' for designing graph algorithms. Recent and ongoing work by the PI and collaborators led to the current best algorithms for many key problems involving graph Laplacians, and more importantly, significantly broadened the scope of problems addressed. An underlying theme in these results is that the most powerful tools work with intermediate algorithmic states, and the focus of this project is a more in-depth study of this phenomenon using ideas from data structures, which also construct and reuse intermediate algorithmic states. These directions of investigation will lead to new algorithmic constructs, give improved tools for computing on static and dynamic data, and enable new applications based on computations on graphs and matrices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A potential solution is dissolvable, biodegradable magnesium alloy implants that maintain sufficient mechanical integrity long enough for the factored bone to heal, and then dissolve thus eliminating the need for any further surgical intervention.  The fundamental challenge in achieving this is to slow down and control the dissolution rate of magnesium alloys within the body. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award seeks to address this by applying laser peening, a local deformation process that induces favorable compressive stresses and reduces corrosion rates, to the entire material volume and not just its surface as conventionally undertaken. This will be done by implementing laser peening at intermediate stages during additive manufacturing, a process that builds parts in a layer by layer manner. If successful this project will result in new manufacturing knowledge on printing defined mechanical properties in metallic materials that is extendable beyond magnesium alloys, and thus can provide the US manufacturing base with new capabilities to strengthen their competitiveness.   Educational components of the award that will increase future workforce preparedness include: (1) encouraging U.S. students' pursuit of advanced degrees in manufacturing, especially from underrepresented groups in STEM; (2) promoting entrepreneurship training and commercialization of fundamental additive manufacturing research through an engineering startup competition and participation in the NSF I-Corps Program; and (3) provide a pathway to employment for credentialed students through academic apprenticeships in additive manufacturing. Further, leveraging this project with the University's established outreach program with Navajo Technical University will better position Dine students to pursue research-oriented careers and start businesses that remain on tribal lands.<br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is isolate how strengthening mechanisms and residual stress caused by interspersing peened layers (i.e., barrier layers) inhibit dislocation motion and affect stress-corrosion behavior. The approach applies laser peening on multiple layers during printing to form an aggregate surface integrity throughout the entire build volume as opposed to a traditional external surface modification. Central to this goal is to understand how thermal inputs (from depositing the next layer of material), and mechanical inputs (from later peening stages) affect the favorable compressive stress profile induced by earlier peening steps. This will be achieved by 1) quantification of dislocation densities resulting from work hardening, grain refinement, and residual stresses, 2) verification of magnesium alloy strength and ductility resulting from varied spatial treatment frequencies, and 3) verification of increased stress-corrosion resistance.  This will result in a new mathematical model to predict how frequently to asynchronously print and peen a magnesium target to mitigate thermal and mechanical cancellation of previous peening steps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the increase of human-induced seismicity, regions that previously had lower seismic risk (e.g., central United States) are now facing earthquake-related hazards. The dramatic increase in the seismicity rate during the past decade in central US, and the improved instrumentation here and in California provide a rich dataset of well-recorded small-to-moderate sized earthquakes in two very different geologic settings; one dominated by tectonic motion on the great San Andreas fault, and the other where human activities induced earthquakes on less continuous, smaller, faults. This provides the opportunity to learn more about the controlling factors and consequences of earthquakes in both settings. By studying and comparing the earthquakes and their interactions in two very differently deforming regions (Northern California and Oklahoma), this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental processes of earthquake physics, their dependence on tectonic setting, and help reduce earthquake related hazards. An improvement in understanding of the relationship between earthquake rupture processes and hazard parameters (seismicity and ground motion) could help to reduce seismic hazard posed to local communities and important infrastructure. This analysis will also combine earthquake and industry 3D seismic data, which will help to develop guidelines to identify potentially hazardous critically stressed faults in Oklahoma. The project includes mentoring and collaboration on a range of levels, contributing to the education of two graduate students (at OU) and support for an early-career PI (at OU). The derived state-of-the-art database of earthquake catalog, cluster characteristics and source parameters will provide fundamental input for many studies, and will be of broad interest to earthquake hazard community, and understanding of earthquake physics. The methods and workflow will feed into activities for classes in earthquake and exploration seismology, and structural geology. <br/><br/>The complexity of earthquakes is a significant factor governing earthquake source dynamics and the consequent ground motions, and it is related to complexity in the fault structures on which the earthquakes occur. This project will use both high-quality earthquake seismograms and industrial 3D seismic data, and develop improved techniques to quantify complexity and enhance our understanding of the fundamental earthquake source process on a variety of temporal and spatial scales. The researchers focus on the inherent earthquake source variability, its relationship with geologic structure, and its influence on earthquake sequence evolution and ground motion patterns. They perform a combined spectral and time domain analysis of earthquake sources and geological fault structure in two distinct tectonic settings: northern California which is dominated by the San Andreas plate-boundary fault, and Oklahoma where human activities are inducing earthquakes in a low-strain rate region. Spectral complexity and source-time-function complexity will be quantified, and automatic classification methods will be developed to identify complex earthquakes. Collocated high-resolution industrial 3D seismic data and seismicity enables us to better understand characteristics of seismogenic faults in the basement in detail.

Large-scale industrial agriculture has led to significant socio-economic gains, but at environmental costs (soil erosion, nutrient pollution, and aquatic acidification) in this region. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices have been proposed as solutions to these costs, as they not only increase crop yield, but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and sustain soil and water quality. However, the effectiveness of CSA practices varies under diverse climate and land use conditions and involves tightly coupled carbon, water, and nutrient cycles. These interactions have not been well studied, and this knowledge gap has hindered understanding and efficient application of CSA practices to achieve the benefits of enhancing food production, climate mitigation, and environmental sustainability. The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated ecosystem monitoring, modeling, and machine learning framework (EcoM3) that incorporates field observations, satellite remote sensing data, process-based modeling, and a deep-learning approach to systematically investigate specific effects of CSA practice (no-tillage and cover crops) on key agroecosystem indicators (crop yield, soil carbon storage, greenhouse gases, and carbon/nitrogen leaching) at multiple scales. This project will use a long-term field site in Kentucky (continuous observations over 50 years) as one testing site to investigate CSA practice effects from daily to seasonal, annual, decadal scales; examine varied CSA effects at multiple sites with diverse climate and soil conditions across the Mississippi River basin; and predict the potential impacts of CSA practices at the entire river basin scale. Multi-scale data and model results will be integrated into the learning platform of the EcoM3 framework to communicate temporal and spatial CSA effectiveness with diverse stakeholders and policy-makers.<br/><br/>This study addresses a challenging question: Will an enhanced systems approach advance our understanding of the interconnected relationships among agroecosystems, climate, and environment systems sufficiently to allow us to simultaneously manage multiple goals (food security, carbon sequestration, and environmental sustainability)? This study represents a systematic method to investigate the comprehensive effects of CSA practices in agricultural systems at both site and regional scales under heterogeneous climate and soil conditions. The proposed EcoM3 framework incorporates CSA management that is targeted to advance conceptual and operational understanding of interactions and feedback loops among climate, land use/management, and ecosystems. Products derived from this study will improve the mechanistic representation of the agroecosystem in Environmental System Models toward a more accurate prediction of biogeochemical cycles and future climate change and will provide viable recommendations for farmers and a scientific basis for making evidence-informed policy about building sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture. Research findings will be communicated with farmers through local extension meetings and the Multi-state Farmer Summit (representatives across regions in Mississippi River basin). Project products will enhance awareness about the importance of CSA management in building climate-resilient agroecosystems and preserving soil and water health.

These samples come from a variety of tissues in human or other organisms under numerous conditions and are an invaluable resource for other scientists to reanalyze and discover new biology. However, these data are severely underused because finding the samples one is interested in from the sea of all samples is still very hard. This is because most sample descriptions are written using language that is hard to search unambiguously or are incomplete in reporting every critical aspect of the sample source. This project seeks to democratize data-driven biology by annotating publicly available samples from six species (human and five animal models) on a massive scale, which will enable researchers to discover relevant published data for further analysis. A web-interface will be developed to provide researchers a single access point to all these annotations and the related search tools. The insights and tools from this project will have far-reaching implications for how the biological researchers will submit, store, manage, access, reuse, and re-share data. Improving data discoverability and reusability will increase the accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility of biological research overall, saving resources by accelerating scientific discovery. The educational/training activities that will be developed in this project will result in formalizing and openly disseminating the ?hidden curriculum? in modern bioinformatics: the abstract experiential skills critical for holistic, practical competency in conducting large data analysis and research in a rapidly changing bioinformatics landscape. This effort will create openness and equity in professional training in applying computing to study biology.<br/><br/>This project will develop new machine learning methods that use both text and molecular data to assign comprehensive, standardized annotations to publicly-available omics samples. The barrier for complete and structured sample descriptors is two-fold: Samples are routinely described using non-standard, varied terminologies written in unstructured natural language, and Even basic attributes, e.g., tissue or environment, are omitted from sample descriptions if they were not factors considered in the original study. The objective of this project is to remove both of these barriers and will integrate state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) advances to: develop ML methods to infer standardized annotations from plain text descriptions, jointly from multiple omics types; develop ML models to predict structured metadata from molecular omics profiles, jointly from multiple species; and develop methods to integrate these text- and omics-profile-based models to comprehensively annotate millions of samples, and tools for researchers to use this massive resource to glean novel biology.

Mandates are being proposed for all new light vehicles to install V2X devices in the near future for such beneficial data collection. A deployable privacy preserving toolkit is critically needed for privately collecting and analyzing V2X data so that the envisioned applications can be fully functional. This project aims at addressing such privacy concerns in practical V2X data collection and analysis for urban traffic modeling, and thus will facilitate the real-world deployment of connected vehicles and V2X systems/applications. Furthermore, this project integrates research results into the curricula at Illinois Institute of Technology, and University of Washington, and provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, especially under-represented and minority students, to participate in cutting-edge research. It also disseminates state-of-the-art privacy preserving techniques into the intelligent transportation and connected vehicles communities.<br/><br/>This project develop a series of novel privacy preserving V2X data collection and analysis techniques with provable privacy guarantees. In the first research thrust, novel V2X data collection schemes will be developed to locally perturb V2X data by each vehicle and they will be aggregated for large-scale urban traffic modeling while satisfying the emerging rigorous notion of local differential privacy (LDP). In the second research thrust, novel cryptographic protocols under the secure multiparty computation (MPC) theory will be designed for the infrastructure and vehicles to securely analyze the V2X data for small-scale urban traffic modeling. Such two categories of privacy preserving techniques are expected to fundamentally advance the literature of LDP and MPC (e.g., designing new randomization mechanisms for LDP).

This is one of the main reasons why 3D imaging is still not omnipresent in our society, and still solely trained experts with task-specific equipment are able to capture high-quality 3D models. This project seeks to build a ?one fits all? system that has the potential to change this. The targeted system enables precise 3D measurements of complicated surfaces/scenes in today?s billion-dollar industries, such as virtual reality, industrial inspection, autonomous navigation, or medical imaging. Many of these industries routinely run into particularly challenging scenarios for 3D scanning systems. Moreover, a scene-independent and precise 3D sensing system can have many applications. The produced sets of high-quality 3D data can usher the next wave in vision-related artificial intelligence research, leading to algorithms with unprecedented detection quality, prediction accuracy, or navigation precision.

In North America, the oceanic Pacific plate is subducting beneath the south coast of Alaska, generating powerful earthquakes and active volcanoes on Earth?s surface. But where inside the Earth does this subducted plate then go? Tracking this plate into the Earth tells us about the more recent history of plate movement on the surface over millions of years, as well as how the Earth has evolved since it formed over billions of years. To understand the present, we must investigate the past.  Much like ultrasound waves are used to look at organs inside a body, seismologists use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to investigate the inner workings of the Earth. The sharpness or blurriness of the images is controlled, among others, by the pitch (or frequency) of the waves that are used. Higher frequencies improve the focus but require heavy computations in the whole Earth. Assumptions can be used to simplify the calculations, reducing the heavy computations to the part of the Earth that we want to image. This simplification means that we can improve our focus and better track the history of subduction under Alaska. The study will support the training of a graduate student and provide support for an early-career investigator.  The PIs will share codes and models with the community, and will be involved in local outreach in the Bay Area.<br/><br/>The evolution of Alaska over the past 200 Ma features multiple episodes of subduction, collision and accretion. The remnants of this long subduction history should be present down to the lowermost mantle, but past regional and global tomographic models resolve inconsistent structures, likely owing to methodological limitations and limited sampling. Our understanding of the plate tectonics history of the Northern Pacific is currently incomplete. Remaining questions include: how deep do slabs penetrate beneath Alaska, what is the slab geometry and thickness, and how does it interact with the transition zone?  The primary objective of this proposal is to improve the resolution of whole mantle regional seismic images beneath Alaska using a Full Waveform Inversion method applied within a restricted region, referred to as ?box? tomography. Full Waveform Inversion is required to account for the effects of multipathing and wavefront healing that otherwise mask strong and local heterogeneity, such as slabs and surrounding mantle wedges. Moreover, the spatially restricted ?box? approach couples a fast 1D and slower 3D wavefield solver thus reducing computation time, which enables the team to use higher frequency regional and teleseismic body waves. Using a combination of 3-component surface wave, overtone and body waveforms, a shear velocity model will first be constructed. Increasing the maximum frequency of the computations as iterations progress, and with additional body waveforms sensitive to compressional velocity, compressional velocity images will be obtained. This analysis will significantly sharpen existing images of seismic wavespeeds and radial anisotropy, particularly at transition zone depths and the mid and lower mantle.  These higher resolution tomographic images of the mantle beneath Alaska will help to (1) constrain the history of subduction and mantle dynamics in this region, and (2) compute more accurate mantle corrections for core phases observed on polar paths from the south Sandwich Islands to stations in Alaska, which present a particularly large spread of travel time anomalies, at least part of which is likely due to Alaska slab structure. The results of the work will be of interest to geodynamicists for modeling flow in the mantle beneath subduction zones, and in plate motion reconstructions, by allowing better identification of subducted slabs. It will also be of interest to geodynamicists and mineral physicists investigating the pattern and origin of inner core anisotropy. Moreover, a robust, high resolution tomographic model of Alaska and a method for providing corrections for its effects will improve the utility of the USArray stations in Alaska for other deep Earth studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, it does so in disparate organisms ranging from the simplest animals to corals, snails, fish, and frogs. Yet, it is still not known what enables microbial communities to grow and function so effectively inside mucus. New evidence suggests that the sugar-coated molecules that form mucus shape microbiomes through physical, chemical, and nutritive interactions. This hypothesis will be tested by addressing three questions: What properties of mucus do microbes care about? How are microbes structured in mucus -- who is next to whom and why? And, what are the processes by which microbiomes self-organize in mucus? This work combines the distinct and complementary expertise of three scientists specializing in mucus biochemistry, microbiome structure and molecular biology, and the biophysics of microbe-mucus interactions. Understanding how mucus controls microbiomes could yield new strategies for protecting humans from infections, as well as for leveraging beneficial microbes that can help humans and animals thrive in other ways such as by improving food digestion and salt tolerance. The investigators will also develop new citizen science initiatives and demonstrations, integrate research and education, and engage students and teachers to help create a diverse community of researchers and change the perception of mucus from a slimy waste product to a fascinating biomaterial with critical biological functions.<br/><br/>Mucus is a critically important habitat for microbes.  Despite its pivotal importance to human and animal functioning, however, the mechanisms by which mucus interacts with microbiomes are not understood. Indeed, mucus interacts with microbes in two seemingly conflicting ways, maintaining a dense and diverse healthy microbiome while simultaneously clearing and disarming harmful microbes. This research team will unravel this puzzle by investigating the mechanisms underlying this key Rule of Life, with the hypothesis that mucus shapes microbiomes through physical, chemical, and nutritive interactions. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will (I) Evaluate how mucin glycans--the chains of different sugars that decorate mucin proteins-- select for specific microbes in natural communities, (II) Identify the influence of different mucus components on the intricate spatial structure of complex microbial communities, and (III) Determine the mechanisms by which mucus regulates microbial community assembly. By revealing the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms by which mucins influences microbial community structure (both taxonomic and spatial), this work will elucidate the essential role played by mucus as an ecological habitat that supports the growth of beneficial commensal microbes while also preventing the outgrowth of pathogens. The results will also benefit society by informing applications that seek to engineer mucus-inspired materials to control environmental and organismal microbiomes.

Deep neural networks can now perform some tasks as well as humans, such as identifying faces, recognizing objects, and other perception tasks. However, existing approaches have limitations, including the inability to effectively learn over time when data is structured without forgetting past information, learning slowly by looping over data many times, and amplification of pre-existing dataset bias which results in erroneous predictions for groups with less data. To overcome these problems, this research project aims to incorporate memory consolidation processes inspired by the mammalian memory system that occur both when animals are awake and asleep.

The US wildfire management strategy has changed from ?fighting wildfires? to ?living with wildfires,? which involves community adaptation to wildfires. Post-wildfire landslides have been identified as a serious cascading risk to community adaptation to wildfires, but the fundamental initiation mechanisms are not yet understood. There is currently no wildfire-specific approach to evaluating the landslide susceptibility of burned hillslopes. This project will be the first step toward developing a wildfire-specific framework for analyzing the stability of hillslopes as a function of time, saturation, and forest use practices for different intensity fires and different landslide mechanisms. The research will be integrated with an education program aiming to place a new generation of engineers in a position to analyze and alleviate the risk of post-wildfire landslides, inform the policy makers, and promote community education about such risks.<br/><br/>The primary research objective of this study is to quantify the fundamental mechanisms that change mechanical and hydrologic soil behavior and therefore slope stability in post-wildfire environments. The fundamental mechanisms are hypothesized to be controlled by forest system dynamics (i.e., tree loss, regrowth, ash movement), that synergistically control suction stress. To achieve the primary research objective, the following specific objectives will be achieved: 1) quantify post-wildfire suction stress and forest system dynamics over time, 2) identify the change functions for the components of forest system dynamics in relation to suction stress, and 3) evaluate post-wildfire shallow landslide susceptibility using a probabilistic approach. This will require a multiscale investigation of soil behavior in post-wildfire environments. The research plan involves testing soil behavior from the atomic scale to the hillslope scale and will allow multi-sensor data fusion. Field and laboratory data will be combined with spatial data from LiDAR scans and aerial photographs. The spatial variability in suction stress along the hillslope will be presented as a distribution function and will be an input for a probabilistic slope stability model for evaluating the wetting-induced shallow landslide susceptibility of burned hillslopes. In addition, the dependency of the adsorptive component of suction stress on the soil water retention curve will be investigated through water vapor sorption isotherms. This will improve our understanding of the degree of physicochemical forces on mechanical soil behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
