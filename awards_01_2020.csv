Currently, the formal understanding for this new soft robot is limited. This project will investigate the fundamental limits and full range of capabilities of the vine robots. The benefits of this project are threefold: (1) Progress of Science - The basic understanding of vine robots created during this work will enable the design of robots as tools for scientific discovery. For instance, vine robots will aid archeologists exploring ruins, and biologists exploring underground creatures; (2) Societal - The robots enabled by this work will demonstrate new functionality; miniaturized medical vine robots will enable safe and efficient endovascular surgery to advance national health, and burrowing vine robots will enable access to the largely unexplored subterranean world; and (3) Educational - The soft robot-centered educational content, designed to be engaging and active, while eliciting creativity, problem solving and critical thinking, will prepare the next generation of engineers and scientists to make impactful contributions to the world.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to use analytical modeling and hypothesis-driven experimentation to elucidate the physical principles governing the behavior of vine robots. It is critical to create the body of knowledge that rigorously describes its behavior to realize the full potential of this concept. This project will be accomplished in three Aims, in which the researcher will: (1) Investigate dynamic growth in free space to establish the underlying physical principles; (2) Investigate dynamic growth in constrained environments: and (3) Apply principles from Aims 1 and 2 to enable new vine robot applications: medical vine robots in the body?s pathways and burrowing robots in the subterranean world. The knowledge gained?from new scaling laws to a formalization of vine robot workspace to a predictive understanding of obstacle interaction force?will help lay the foundational understanding for this fledgling sub-field of soft robotics. This will enable not only parameter optimization, but fundamentally new approaches and designs for vine robots. More broadly, the new understanding will advance the field of soft robotics?advancing our understanding of soft systems that deform and dynamically adapt to their environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a graph may describe pairs of networking devices directly connected together or pairs of roadway intersections connected by a stretch of road. Many useful tasks, such as understanding the reliability of a computer network or finding the fastest route between two locations, can be performed by doing computations on these graphs. When a graph has certain properties such as being drawable on a piece of paper without crossings between its connections, it becomes possible to do these types of computations much more quickly than if the properties were not present. Many of these faster computations rely on important results from topology, the mathematical study of what properties geometric objects maintain after certain types of deformations. This project seeks to better understand the role topology can take both in performing fast computations on graphs and explaining what graph properties are necessary for these fast computations. The project aims to make substantial topology based additions to the toolkit used in graph computations. These additions should make new computational tasks possible and greatly simplify established tasks. The project involves a substantial education component as well that includes educating students on the known connections between topology and computer science and providing undergraduate minority students their first opportunities to participate in the research process.<br/><br/>The research activities have three components. The first involves generalizing known planar graph algorithms for many fundamental problems in computer science to graphs embeddable in low complexity surfaces. The second component explores how topological intuitions and tools created during the first component can be used to solve difficult problems back in the setting of planar graphs. The third component involves pushing these tools to their limits in the creation of algorithms for more general families of graphs than those embeddable in low complexity surfaces with a focus on the so-called H-minor-free graphs. The types of problems studied for all three components include the computations of optimal network flows, minimum cuts, and shortest paths. Student education will take place through the development of a new course in computational topology at the awardee institution that focusses on graph algorithms and topological data analysis. Activities for undergraduate minority students will consist primarily of the implementation and experimental analysis of algorithms designed during the primary research activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within probability, we study random walks, which are used to model various physical and economic phenomena, and also have important connections to other fields of mathematics. In this project we explore some long standing mysteries regarding random walks, and in particular are interested in understanding path-dependence: for which random walks do random fluctuations in the beginning have a lasting impact on the long term? A further objective is to explore newly discovered connections to questions in information theory and economics: Which sources of information are more valuable in the long term? And how is information priced? The educational component of this project will include novel research opportunities for undergraduate students, with the aim of attracting promising students to this field by exposing them to modern questions and techniques.<br/><br/>The Furstenberg-Poisson boundary of a random walk on a group has been the object of intense study since its introduction in Furstenberg's foundational work in the 1960s and 1970s. This literature is by now mature, with many established connections to neighboring fields. Yet, some compelling basic questions remain open. For example: which groups admit finitely supported random walks with a non-trivial boundary? In this project we hope to leverage recent breakthroughs to advance the state of the art in this field, and in particular to study the so-called ""stability conjecture"" and ""gap conjecture."" In the field of topological group actions, the notions of proximality and strong proximality have been the object of a large research effort. Recently, it has been shown that a finitely generated group is virtually nilpotent if and only if all of its proximal actions on compact spaces have fixed points. This establishes a still mysterious connection between proximal actions and the Furstenberg-Poisson boundary, which we plan to explore. Finally, this project will also explore stochastic dominance, which is is an important tool for comparison of distributions in economics and statistics. We will pursue a recently initiated research agenda studying the interaction of stochastic dominance and convolution, with applications to the Blackwell theory of experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Windstorms, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, continue to cost billions in economic losses each year in the United States, much of which is due to the performance of buildings. In response, researchers collect increasingly vast datasets documenting the post-windstorm state of buildings. These data have the potential to drive advancements in both fundamental science and engineering practice that will strengthen the resilience of buildings and communities and can reduce future losses and other impacts. The robust capabilities for capturing windstorm performance data vastly outweigh current capabilities for learning from this data, which are typically incomplete, biased, and ill-suited for efficient discovery and application of knowledge. This project will develop a robust, theory-guided, statistical inference framework for learning from post-windstorm data that will transform the scale to understand and predict windstorm damage, specifically for low-rise buildings. These advancements will spur the development and implementation of more effective windstorm risk mitigation and more robust education strategies, and further inform more efficient and intelligent post-disaster reconnaissance methodologies. An interactive outreach platform will be developed to translate the research findings to the general public and increase public awareness of the critical factors affecting windstorm performance. A new graduate and undergraduate student organization will be developed to foster inter-disciplinary collaboration within the disaster research community that will produce a new generation of engineers, social scientists, and policy makers that have a more holistic understanding of disasters and disaster risk mitigation. Data from this project will be archived and made publicly available in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org).  This grant supports the National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).  <br/><br/>Windstorm performance of buildings is a function of a complex set of interacting factors that span meteorology, engineering, public policy, and socioeconomics that are not holistically understood. The specific goal of this research is to combine traditional data science with fundamental theory and expert knowledge to create a theory-guided, statistical inference framework that will enable efficient knowledge discovery from high-dimensional post-windstorm reconnaissance data. The project will utilize high quality post-windstorm datasets from recent windstorms collected by the NSF-supported Structural Extreme Events Reconnaissance network, enriched using additional data layers and human-machine techniques, to form robust testbeds for developing and piloting the new framework. The framework will build upon probabilistic graphical models, which allow established theory and expert knowledge to define known windstorm performance factors and their fundamental interrelationships, while focusing on causal inference as the goal rather than black box predictions. Ultimately, the research will enable a holistic understanding of the relative contributions of known windstorm performance factors, identify previously unknown or underestimated factors, and target new research areas supported by field observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex analysis is a fundamental tool in many applications. In particular, it is used in physics (for instance: studying the flow of air past an airfoil and dispersion relations in optics), engineering (for instance: signal processing and control theory), and computer science (for instance: image processing and quantum computation). Complex analysis of a single variable is a classical and well understood mathematical subject, but when additional variables are introduced many mysteries remain. In this project, the PI will further the theoretical understanding of complex analysis of several variables. This project also has a substantial educational component: The PI will develop a research experience in data science for first year undergraduate students at Louisiana State University (LSU). This program will prepare participants for a career in STEM, solidify their knowledge of basic mathematics, and give them an opportunity to learn about data science. <br/><br/>In the research part of this project, the PI will study bounded domains in complex Euclidean space and relate intrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the geometry of the Kaehler-Einstein metric) to extrinsic geometric conditions (e.g. the CR-geometry of the boundary). Many classical results in the subject consider bounded domains in complex Euclidean space, assume that the boundary is smooth, and make assumptions about the CR-geometry of the boundary. For domains with non-smooth boundary, the PI will prove new variants of classical results by assuming geometric conditions on the Kaehler-Einstein metric instead of conditions on the boundary.  Using this approach, the PI will be able to study classes of domains which are typically outside the reach of the standard analytic methods and also make progress on old problems. This approach is motivated by the great success of geometric group theory where metric space techniques applied to group theory not only lead to progress on old problems, but also many new and interesting examples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the lithium-ion battery is reaching its theoretical energy density limit, other technologies such as lithium-air battery, fuel cells, and super capacitors have great potential as the next generation energy storage and energy conversion technologies. The power density and energy density of these electrochemical technologies are often limited by the supply of reactants within porous electrodes. Clear understanding of transport phenomena within the pores is required to rationally design and engineer high-performance electrodes and devices. This project will apply advanced imaging technologies, customized electrode materials, and computational approaches to visualize and reconstruct pore-scale geometries of electrodes and develop new theories and tools to understand multiphase transport phenomena in porous electrodes. Results from this project will advance the development of environmentally friendly electric storage and conversion technologies. Research outcomes will be incorporated into summer camps, local STEM education platforms, and curriculum developments to educate and train local students with diverse backgrounds. The partnership with local industry will also nurture an educated professional workforce in the Kansas's metropolitan areas.<br/><br/>Porous electrodes with high specific surface area are widely used in a variety of electrochemical systems such as batteries, fuel cells, super capacitors, flow batteries, and electrolysis technologies to provide sufficient reaction sites for electrochemical reactions.  The goal of this project is to fundamentally understand pore-scale multiphase transport phenomena applicable to porous electrodes of electrochemical devices, considering spatial distributions of the solid matrix and filling fluids, and directly address key barriers to improved system-level performance (energy, power, efficiency etc.). In pursuit of the research goal, this project will integrate experiments and simulations to elucidate how the spatial distribution of each phase governs the pore-level multiphase transfer and system-level performance of porous electrodes. The clear understanding of the spatial phase distributions on transport phenomena is particularly important for sustaining performance in devices equipped with electrodes whose pore-size distributions and properties change over time. Fundamental knowledge on multiphase transport phenomena will fill a significant knowledge gap in porous-electrode engineering.

Turning has been linked to recurrent falls in older adults because it imposes mechanical conflict between balancing and changing direction. Falls in older adults frequently lead to injury and sometimes death. By some accounts, turning-while-walking can comprise up to 50 percent of steps taken in any given day. Retraining balance strategies used during turning-while-walking has potential to reduce fall risk. This project will identify relationships between person-specific balance strategies used during turning and other factors including physiological and cognitive capabilities - such as strength and capacity for spatial reasoning - as well as environmental factors such as the presence or absence of obstacles. This information will be used to design personalized auditory biofeedback tuned to convey information about movement kinematics and foot forces in a way that facilitates dynamic balance during walking. An initial set of experiments will test human perception and motor responses to sonified biofeedback of dynamic balance information. Additional experiments will test the ability of fall-prone older adults to use personalized biofeedback to improve dynamic balance during turns. This project advances the national health by developing a machine learning approach to the diagnosis of balance deficits in older adults as well as a novel sonified biofeedback approach to improving dynamic balance in that population. The project includes an education and outreach plan, including an innovative ?Artist in Residence? program, that will expose underrepresented groups to cutting edge engineering and scientific research in a way that is engaging for engineers and young artists alike. <br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that interactive sonified biofeedback can improve balance strategies used by fall-risk older adults during turning-while-walking. This project has three research objectives. In the first, the PI will conduct human subjects experiments to characterize person-specific relationships between dynamic balance strategies used during turns, physiological and cognitive capabilities, and environmental factors. Participants will walk and turn within the controlled setting of the research lab and outdoors while wearing technology that can sense and transmit movement kinematics and ground reaction forces in real-time. For the second objective, the PI will establish how sonification can be used to train specific balance strategies and the extent to which those strategies can be retained and used without dependency on concurrent biofeedback.  Working in conjunction with a sound designer, the PI will develop soundscapes that sonify balance metrics during unconstrained body movements, evaluate their ability to modulate measures of stability in real-time during repeated training sessions, and test their ability to elicit long-lasting behavioral change. In the third objective, the PI will test the ability of machine learning models to diagnose person-specific balance deficits during turns compared to clinician diagnoses, and to design personalized biofeedback soundscapes that can mitigate clinician-diagnosed balance deficits.  Here, the PI will use Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzman Machines to generate person-specific, turn-type specific, and deficit-specific models that will be able to generate personalized sonified biofeedback to improve balance during turns.

Adoption of lightweight composites for structural components is transforming the transportation industry, which pursues improved vehicle performance, better fuel economy, and reduced emissions. However, manufacturing these advanced composites involves complex processes that inevitably cause part variability and unintended defects, such as voids, fiber wrinkles, residual stresses, and geometric distortions. The lack of robust modeling tools makes the composite manufacturers heavily reliant on trial-and-error approaches to minimize part variability, resulting in high manufacturing costs and limiting innovations for new process and part designs. This research project will develop an in-depth understanding of defects and variability arising from manufacturing processes, and will elucidate the correlation between the constituent properties, processing conditions, and structural performance. The resulting predictive models will lead to significant cost savings in new process and product development which achieves consistent and improved quality of composite components. The research program will be integrated with a diverse range of education and outreach activities, including developing an online certificate program in composites to prepare students for jobs in advanced manufacturing, providing research opportunities to college and high school students, and informing the general public about the societal impact of composites and career opportunities through museum demonstrations.<br/><br/>The research goal is to predict the processing-induced defects and develop manufacturing strategies to improve the performance of advanced fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites through an integrated multi-physics and multiscale modeling framework in conjunction with a novel in-situ process monitoring method.

Consumer flexibility refers to a consumer's explicit willingness to receive one of an assortment of offered options in exchange for a reward or discount. Two examples in the retail and service sectors include (i) opaque products in online retail and travel, where consumers are willing to purchase an article of clothing of unknown color or travel to an unspecified destination, and (ii) large time windows in scheduled services such as grocery delivery and medical appointments, where consumers are willing to receive service in one of multiple time slots. The research fundamentally benefits consumers and firms by providing discounted flexible options to consumers while reducing operational costs of selling products and services. This award supports research on foundational tools for understanding, embedding, and embracing consumer flexibility in e-commerce and service systems, focusing on both the demand and supply perspectives. The plan to integrate research and education includes further developing the NYC Operations Day conference to embrace doctoral students via presentation opportunities, mentorship, and funding from this project, as well as course enrichment and the mentoring and education of undergraduate and doctoral students.<br/><br/>In order to fully embrace consumer flexibility, researchers and practitioners require a new set of tools for managing demand with flexible options and for converting consumer flexibility into operational efficiency. From the demand perspective, this project provides a computationally tractable framework for incorporating consumer flexibility.  Since the valuations for flexible options are correlated with the traditional options with special structure, previous models and algorithms in this domain do not apply. This research will develop new analytical methods and tractable approximation approaches for modeling consumer behavior in choice models, leading to new pricing analysis and tools that address the inherent mathematical difficulties introduced by flexible options. From the supply perspective, classical operational models will be extended to incorporate consumer flexibility. In inventory management, this project will develop algorithms that quantify and leverage consumer flexibility to better balance inventory and reduce supply chain costs.

The project advances three novel ideas.  First, the PI will use Amazon Mechanical Turk to implement a teleoperation system (user interface, user management system, and robot learning database) linking a group of human operators with remote robots. This approach, called ""Crowdsourced Surrogate Learning"" (CSL), builds a database of sensor, motor, and machine vision data collected while a large number of people separately use a novel chopsticks-like robot to teleoperate a similar robot to conduct industrial and social tasks. These human subjects experiments will provide the data needed for subsequent robot skill learning and generalization using an approach called ""Robot Composite Learning"" (RCL).

This problem is due, in part, to the deeply-held beliefs that people in positions of power hold about race and gender. However, such deeply-held beliefs often remain outside of a person?s conscious awareness. This CAREER project will contribute to broadening participation in engineering by 1) analyzing the beliefs that engineering faculty, staff and administrators hold about why minoritization of women and people of color endures in engineering culture, 2) analyzing how they justify these beliefs, and 3) characterizing the experiences that they recognize as key to their evolution. These research contributions will directly inform the design of meaningful opportunities for others (engineering educators or members of society more broadly) to surface and critically reflect on their deeply-held beliefs in order to evolve towards ever-increasingly inclusive conduct, especially with respect to race- and gender- based minoritization in engineering.<br/><br/>Prior work on broadening participation in engineering has primarily focused on understanding minoritized students and their experiences, commonly from a deficit perspective. This CAREER project takes a complementary approach by focusing on race or gender-based majority-group (male and/or white) engineering faculty, staff and administrators who are recognized as proponents of diversity and inclusion by a member of a minoritized group. The motivation for studying these privileged individuals includes the following:  (i) the vast majority of engineering faculty and administrators belong a racial and/or gender majority group, so efforts to broaden participation must enable their development as inclusive educators, (ii) the privileges associated with their majority-group status(es) potentially allow them to evolve without ever critically reflecting on how their socialization has enabled beliefs that maintain racist and sexist educational systems, (iii) their decisions shape the design and implementation of undergraduate engineering education programs, and (iv) they have the systemic power to shift engineering culture more broadly. Methodologically, the research will include a series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with participants framed by Argumentative Thinking as a way to access deeply-held beliefs and Narrative Analysis in order to situate beliefs within an individuals? salient life experiences. The research findings will inform the design and implementation of professional development opportunities targeting other majority-group educators to take responsibility for disrupting the problematic status quo for participation in engineering by surfacing and critically reflecting on their own deeply-held beliefs. By understanding how to effectively surface and potentially change the deeply-held beliefs of majority-group engineering educators, this project is a critical step for broader change toward a culture where majority-group members hold each other accountable for broadening participation in engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Anticipating interactions among product variants to better meet overall product-line marketing and regulatory goals is challenging for manufacturers. For example, to help comply with fuel economy regulations, automotive manufacturers have introduced new sets of vehicles. To do so in a commercially successful way, the manufacturers need to differentiate them from other vehicles in the company's product line and their competitors'. Historically, when manufacturers have failed to differentiate, the sales of fuel-efficient vehicles have been lower than expected, and some companies have had to pay penalties for not meeting the fuel economy regulations. If companies could strategically differentiate their cars--for example by making them relatively smaller, with better acceleration, than both their larger, more luxurious vehicles, as well as their competitors' cheaper and more-efficient small cars, they might have increased sales and averted the penalties. Unfortunately, existing product-line design models used by engineers are limited in their ability to support strategic differentiation decisions, because the models' properties are not well understood, there is not enough evidence that they predict real-world behavior adequately, and organizations often do not have in-house expertise to use and adapt them for the appropriate contexts. The research outcomes will enable manufacturers to systematically optimize product-line designs, reaching solutions to firm objectives while meeting regulatory constraints.<br/><br/>To achieve the goals of this research, the work will derive and empirically test new hypotheses about strategic differentiation under sets of market and regulatory conditions and identify classes of product-line optimization models capable of representing this behavior. The research approach combines product-line optimization modeling with econometric analysis. New analyses of industry product-line data will explain systematic properties of strategic differentiation found in industry. The project outcomes will enable the development of (1) a theory that parsimoniously yet credibly explains fundamental properties of optimal strategic differentiation (e.g., clustering, fracturing, and divergent positioning) under different characteristics of design decisions, consumer preference distributions, and regulatory constraints; and (2) empirically-supported product-line design models that optimize engineering design variables considering how adjustments to one product variant's attributes will affect market and regulatory goals of other variants in the line.

Finding useful mathematical representations of designed products and systems is one of the field's long-standing, fundamental, open research problems. It affects almost every major design task, whether that be optimization, understanding decision making and preferences, manufacturing planning, uncertainty quantification, or studying design cognition, behavior, or creativity, among others. But finding useful representations is difficult, because they must concurrently describe multiple mathematical structures, whose types vary across a design's shape, behavior, and function. If successful, such learned design representations can: (1) accelerate technological and economic competitiveness ? e.g., by improving optimization convergence ? (2) enable uncertainty quantification for more complex systems than presently possible ? e.g., in systems with chaotic dynamics like Large Eddy Simulation; and (3) permit fast, accurate manufacturing analysis, computer geometry queries, and design synthesis ? e.g., by providing compact search spaces for analysis algorithms. <br/><br/>By combining advances across three novel mathematical areas -- Differential Geometry, Statistics, and Machine Learning (ML) ? with Engineering Design, the work will advance the science behind how to infer underlying mathematical representations for complex systems, e.g., by enabling existing design methods to extend from single Euclidean representations to general Differential Geometry. Unlike past approaches to design representation, this approach of using both differential geometry and ML enables the research to answer fundamental questions regarding the practical limits of what is ""learnable"" about a system's design in finite samples when multiple, diverse types of representation are needed ? the generated knowledge will answer related questions that arise across other scientific fields.

Among the chief causes for coastal losses of DO are anthropogenic nutrient inputs that lead to seasonal hypoxia- DO concentrations below 2 mg/L. Microorganisms are the primary agents of oxygen removal, and although we have a basic mechanistic understanding of how nutrient enrichment combines with stratification to stimulate microbial metabolism and oxygen drawdown, we still do not know which microorganisms are ultimately responsible for oxygen consumption leading to, and during, coastal hypoxia in any particular region. Nor do we know the extent to which each hypoxic system arises from universal microbial mechanisms or whether there may be unique microorganisms and metabolic pathways involved in each locale. Hypoxic regions are increasing in number and size around the globe, amplifying the need to better understand the microbial processes responsible for oxygen consumption. In response, the project pursues an integrated research and education effort to study the microbial mechanisms of oxygen respiration in two coastal zones where DO depletion occurs: the northern Gulf of Mexico ?dead zone?, and the Southern California Bight. This work identifies the microorganism actively consuming oxygen in these systems, what fuels them, and whether/how those taxa respond to environmental changes. The investigators are generating microbial DO consumption rate, genetic, and taxonomic data critical to better constraining respiration models focused on water column DO depletion. In doing so, hundreds of undergraduate and students and dozens of high school STEM teachers contribute valuable data by participating in modern marine microbiological research. The project also improves integration of authentic research experiences into college and high-school classrooms in the context of a problem of global relevance.<br/><br/>Regions of low DO take multiple forms, from vast open ocean oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) which hover in the upper water column, to shallower coastal zones of bottom water hypoxia fueled by close proximity to fluvial inputs of human supplied nutrients. Microbial respiration is primarily responsible for the ultimate consumption of DO, and therefore understanding the microorganisms that inhabit these systems and their metabolic capabilities is critical for improving our ability to predict the timing, extent, and severity of DO depletion, and how these factors relate to environmental change. While there has been substantial research into the microbiology of OMZs, we know comparatively little about the microbial dynamics, and in particular, the microorganisms responsible for oxygen consumption, in coastal hypoxia. This integrated research and education effort is framed by the following objectives:<br/>1. Determine the microorganisms and metabolic processes responsible for actively respiring water column DO prior to, and during, hypoxia.<br/>2. Quantify microbial respiration rates for communities and representative water column species in both the planktonic and particle-associated fractions.<br/>3. Integrate authentic microbiology research on a globally relevant topic into undergraduate and high school classrooms.<br/><br/>The work uses a combination of advanced cultivation-independent and pure culture measurements to discriminate between oxygen consumption by planktonic and particle-associated microbial fractions, as well as by communities at the surface and those in bottom waters, in two different systems of coastal DO depletion (the northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone and the Southern California coastal shelf). Direct assessment of actively respiring taxa are connected with their metabolic potential, gene expression, and respiration rates. This project is determining, for the first time, the taxa actively consuming oxygen in these systems. The results also provide size fractionated respiration rates and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) with depth across multiple sites and seasons, and importantly, also yield cell-specific respiration rates and BGE for active taxa within these systems. This data will constrain variable respiration across differing environmental conditions. The investigators are experimentally testing how alterations in environmental variables affect these respiration rates and BGEs, leading to greater predictive insight for the range of effects climate forcing will have on DO consumption. This information also facilitates comparisons between multiple marine systems to identify whether common or distinct organisms and metabolic processes are operating to remove DO.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project addresses a new approach to process technology, known as dynamic catalysis, in which the catalyst temperature is varied on the time scale of reactions occurring on the catalyst surface.  The rapid temperature modulation can potentially create conditions that dramatically accelerate the overall reaction rate or change the product distribution in favorable ways.  The study will evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic catalysis by both experimental and theoretical means, with an ultimate aim of decreasing the energy requirements for the catalytic synthesis of ammonia. Considering the highly energy-intensive nature of the industrial ammonia synthesis process, a cleaner and less energy-intensive alternative will have significant economic and environmental impacts. <br/> <br/>The primary goal of the study is to develop a new catalytic strategy for overcoming thermodynamic and kinetic barriers by dynamically operating a catalytic cycle at various temperatures and thermodynamic environments. However, the catalytic nitrogen fixation cycle is blocked at near-ambient conditions by a lack of energy to overcome kinetic/thermodynamic barriers (low temperature) or unfavorable binding energies for surface intermediates (high temperature/low pressure). The study will investigate the possibility that energetic barriers can be overcome at catalytically relevant resonant cycle times by rapidly and dynamically pulsing energy into the system (timescale of approximately 10 milliseconds). The approach combines 1) multi-scale modeling to demonstrate expected catalytic enhancement and determine optimal operating conditions, and 2) experimental testing and reactor design of a pulsed catalysis platform. The expected outcome is new understanding of the potential for nonequilibrium catalytic turnover from both theoretical and experimental approaches.  Ideally, the fundamental understanding will lead to the design of catalyst platforms that operate beyond the theoretical maximum in catalytic turnover suggested by the classic volcano plot relation. The research will be integrated with a wide range of educational and outreach activities aimed at elevated engagement in STEM from students and the public, with particular emphasis on connections between basic research and societal impacts of the nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigation goes beyond traditional individual timescales to understand how and why precipitation at different timescales interact. Of particular focus will be understanding how the seasonal cycle of precipitation varies (i.e., the timing and magnitude of precipitation received throughout the year) and how and why rapid transitions between wet and dry conditions occur. Without a thorough understanding of the processes and mechanisms that control variability, prediction of precipitation variations cannot be improved. The project will be accomplished through analyses of observations and historical forecasts and by conducting climate model experiments to disentangle and unravel precipitation interactions across different timescales. The research will be integrated with an education program that utilizes precipitation variability research to build student?s atmospheric science identity through videos, scientist spotlights, and a Precip-a-Thon. <br/><br/>This project will address fundamental science questions at the interface of grand challenges in weather and climate extremes, water sustainability, and informed decision making. Science will be advanced by quantifying variability and diagnosing mechanisms and predictability of the annual cycle of precipitation, rapid wet-dry transitions, and associated extreme events across North America. Through these scientific advances, our ability to predict impactful precipitation fluctuations will be increased. Understanding, and ultimately predicting, precipitation variability across timescales is a global challenge and the results and methodology generated in this project for North America and sub-regions can be applied to other locations. A comprehensive educational plan is integrated with the project to build an educated, informed, and diverse workforce, including decision-makers, capable of using, interpreting, and understanding climate science.

Coherent structures, such as vortices (eddies) and shear flows, are prominent features in fluid dynamics. The formation, stability, and evolution of coherent structures are critical fluid phenomena to understand in order to reduce drag, oscillation, and instability in scientific and engineering applications. The PI will develop new, innovative mathematical methods to analyze the dynamic properties of physically important coherent structures, which can resolve theoretical difficulties as well as provide powerful mathematical tools for practical applications. The PI will also study the interaction of radiation and particles in the context of wave maps, which have a deep connection to the classical field theories from mathematical physics. The proposed projects provide an ideal training ground for junior researchers in applying cutting edge mathematical analysis to study sophisticated physical phenomena in fluid dynamics and wave propagation. Graduate students will be actively involved in these research projects. <br/> <br/>The PI and collaborators aim to develop new methods that can effectively combine precise spectral and Fourier analysis in the context of nonlinear asymptotic stability problems of fluid dynamics.

The program will address two fundamental education research questions: How can project management skill training be integrated with thesis research in graduate education? What is the role (or value) of learning communities in enhancing the training and retention of professional skills and effectiveness of thesis research? Studies suggest that current graduate education focuses too narrowly on thesis research, and graduate students are not well prepared with skills for future work in industry or the academy. However, limited resources and lack of faculty support prevent students from committing to skill training. To address these challenges, this e program will develop innovative training approaches to help students learn and practice project management skills. <br/><br/>Utilizing the framework of communities of practice, the project will have two major innovations. The first is engaging students with self-directed, learning activities to produce and evaluate new course content as they learn from the curated online modules. The second is practicing the professional skills integrated with the thesis research. This new learning model has the potential to fundamentally change the culture of graduate education, efficiently utilize the current resources, and obtain faculty buy-in. Associated research design will explore factors that may lead to the success of a learning community, help reconceptualize current graduate education and encourage broader adoption of these new approaches within and beyond STEM fields. The evaluation approach is informed by the pragmatic evaluation paradigm, and a variety of data will be collected in the study including program participation data, document analysis, student surveys, and faculty and industry partner interviews. The program will rigorously test over multiple cohort iterations and with control groups the benefits of this approach, including the synergy created between thesis research and professional skill training through the GAPS program. The goal is to disrupt the status quo of graduate education (courses followed by individual research) and build sustainable GAPS communities that can effectively improve professional skills for graduate students.

Intelligent morphology is the concept that natural structures have evolved to reduce the energetic and neurological inputs required to control them. Insects are masterful at exploiting intelligent morphology, utilizing their body's flexibility to interact effortlessly with their environments.   This enables them to perform complex tasks using a small fraction of the energy and cognitive power available to other animals. By contrast, many engineered systems continue to employ rigid components which relegate little function to passive mechanisms.  This limits their energy efficiency, increases controller complexity and reduces their capacity to adapt to dynamic environments.  Using the insect model, this project will generate methodologies that incorporate intelligent morphology design principles into engineered systems, which in turn can enhance their performance and durability.  Concurrently, this award will support the training of future engineers in the fields of dynamics and vibrations through a state-of-the-art Applied Dynamics educational laboratory.   The Applied Dynamics educational laboratory will also host annual week-long workshops focused on teaching the fundamentals of vibrations to rural middle school students who currently have limited access to science programs, as well as other students from underrepresented groups.  Current research topics will be integrated into these educational activities.  <br/><br/><br/>This program aims to develop a data driven system-level model of the insect flight mechanism that is comprised of the following components: the insect wing, abdomen, thorax, wing hinge and wing costal break.  The project focuses on the latter three.  Data collected from dynamical experiments on actual insects will drive component model formulation, and benchtop experimental systems representative of each component will be constructed in order to study biological phenomena in a controlled environment.  Through this integrative approach of analytical modeling, biological testing and benchtop experimentation, this research will demonstrate how (1) the flexible insect thorax minimizes the energetic costs of locomotion, (2) the wing hinge simplifies flight control, and (3) wing buckling enhances insect collision robustness.  Derived models will be reduced order to facilitate parametric studies and will account for complex phenomena associated with viscoelasticity and nonlinearity.   Such models can easily be extended to inform bio-inspired technologies such as flapping wing micro air vehicles and flapping airfoil energy harvesters.  This project contributes to the Principle Investigator?s long-term goal of elucidating the fundamental nature of intelligent morphology in complex biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elastic fibers may regenerate during pregnancy to accommodate the growing fetus.  This also benefits the mother during postpartum healing. However, the ability of these elastic fibers to regenerate may decrease as the mother ages.  This may cause complications such as pelvic floor disorders. This award will support fundamental research to better understand how elastic fiber regeneration in the female reproductive system changes during postpartum healing and with aging. This award will also develop a new mathematical model to describe how elastic fiber regeneration controls tissue function. These elastic fibers are critical to the function of most soft biological tissues. Therefore, this model may also be used to better understand the mechanical behavior of other soft tissues that elastic fibers, such as the lungs, blood vessels, or skin. Further, the mathematical model will tell us if the results we learn by studying postpartum healing can be used to identify therapies that aim to treat, and ultimately prevent, medical problems that arise due to disrupted elastic fibers in other tissues. Research findings from this project will be incorporated into a tabletop board game, teaching modules for K-12 education, and into undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineering courses.<br/><br/>Elastic fibers are critical for biological tissue homeostasis as they not only provide resilience and recoil but may also physically tether cells and other proteins within biological tissues that dictate function. Prior work suggests that regeneration and remodeling of elastic fibers during postpartum healing is critical to maintaining reproductive tissue health. Elastic fiber composition and relative arrangement to other cells and proteins during postpartum healing and aging is unknown. Therefore, this award will determine how elastic fibers dictate the evolving biological tissue microstructure and mechanical function during aging and postpartum healing. In particular, the evolving orientation and relative arrangement of elastic fibers with respect to cells and other biological proteins will be quantified and directly incorporated into a new mathematical model to better understand how elastic fiber regeneration dictates tissue contractility and function. This will be accomplished by: 1) Formulating and validating a biomechanical model that describes the vaginal extracellular matrix, mechanics, and contractility with increasing maternal age; and 2) Determining the effect of maternal age on elastic fiber regeneration and evolving mechanical properties during postpartum healing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One category of immunotherapy involves engineering T Cells, key cells in our immune systems, to better recognize cancer cells. As each patient has a unique response to treatment, and success can be improved using a personalized immunotherapy called adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapy. ACT involves extraction of T Cells from a patient?s own blood, engineering and growing them in large numbers in vitro (outside the body), then reinfusing the engineered T Cells back into the patient. To supply engineered T Cells for ACT therapy, a reliable high-throughput technique is needed to deliver molecules into cells in order to control gene and protein expression. The research goal of this CAREER project is to overcome the limitations of existing delivery techniques by integrating ultrasonic transducers to deliver molecules into cells in a microfluidic system. The proposed intracellular delivery device, called the UXuChip, will improve the molecule delivery efficiency while maintaining T Cell antitumor activity.  Success will help translate immunotherapy from bench to bedside. The primary goal of this project?s education initiative is to integrate the proposed research and educational activities by broadening the education of high school students and the greater community and mentoring at all levels from undergraduate students to post-graduate researchers. The research will be integrated with the development of exciting new educational opportunities on ultrasound imaging, microfluidic chip development, and cancer therapy. Engineering expertise and knowledge will be disseminated to high school students to promote their interest in engineering and biomedical sciences via 10-week research internships.<br/><br/>The investigator's long-term research goal is to utilize engineering principles to develop novel technologies and approaches for cancer diagnosis and therapy.  Towards this goal, the research aim of this CAREER project is to develop the next generation intracellular delivery technique to realize in vitro cell-based therapy to revolutionize therapeutic strategies.   While many immunotherapy treatment plans have shown promising results, a growing number of treated patients experience recurrence and relapse because each patient has a unique response to the same drugs due to cancer heterogeneity and phenotypic diversity.  Failure has been attributed to unwanted genomic and phenotypic alterations, uncontrollable cytokine secretion of engineered T cells, and attacking normal cells by engineered T cells in patients after the intracellular delivery.  To address these unfavorable outcomes, the project will leverage T cell engineering-based immunotherapy by providing a novel intracellular delivery technique with genetic, phenotypic, and functional stability as well as high cell viability and delivery efficiency. The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.  The FIRST Objective is development of an integrated device (UXuChip) using an ultrasonic transducer (UX) and microlens complex and a microfluidic chip (uChip) for cell manipulation. Ultrasound (2 MHz to 200 MHz) generated by a single lithium niobite (LNB) crystal and cylindrically focused by the microlens will push cells to pass through a constriction channel vertically to disrupt the cell plasma membrane to increase permeability for intracellular delivery of macromolecules.  The SECOND Objective is investigation of in vitro cell-level influence of the UXuChip on gene and protein expressions and cytokine secretion, which will be compared with electroporation. Parameters of electroporation and UXuChip will be optimized to achieve cell viability and delivery efficiency over 85% using human / mouse primary T cells. At the same time, CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) will be developed to ablate PD-1, a receptor/checkpoint protein on the surface of T-Cells that limits antitumor activity.  After treatment with electroporation and UXuChip, genome-wide microarray will be performed after 3 and 24 hours. Findings will be used to determine the number of genes that were misexpressed after electroporation and UXuChip treatment and if the effect is prolonged or not. Studies will be designed to test the working hypothesis that the changes in genetic level expression may affect cytokine secretion.  The THIRD Objective is investigation of in vivo effects and assessing the therapeutic potential of engineered T cells by UXuChip by ablating PD-1 using RNPs delivered by UXuChip and electroporation and injecting the engineered T-cells into tumors created in congenic mice.  Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that ablated PD-1 will not be conjugated with PD-L1 on tumor cells, resulting in increased T-cell antitumor activity. The killing potential of T cells treated by UXuChip and electroporation will be compared by monitoring the size of the tumor mass.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these situations, the target parameter is often high-dimensional/high-order, but the important information may lie in dimension-reduced subspaces induced by various structural conditions. How to efficiently exploit these subspaces poses significant statistical and computational challenges. This project aims to address these challenges from a perspective of subspace learning. By taking into account dimension-reduced and low-order subspaces, the PI aims to address a series of statistical and machine learning questions by developing new methodologies and theories with statistical and computational advantages. <br/><br/>This project will progress along three major directions: (i) fast estimation and inference for high-dimensional arrays via important subspace sketching; (ii) high-order clustering with theoretical guarantees; (iii) ultrahigh-order tensor singular value decomposition via a tensor-train parameterization. The research will be applicable to a variety of topics involving high-dimensional matrix and tensor data, such as genetics and genomes, reinforcement learning, neuroimaging analysis, material science, recommender design, etc. The PI will also develop user-friendly software packages for the new algorithms and make them available for public use.

The research involves fabricating a new class of miniature devices called microhydrocyclones using a three-dimensional printing process.  Three-dimensional printing or additive manufacturing is used to create three-dimensional structures with exceptionally high resolution, resulting in features one thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Microhydrocyclones are microfluidic devices that permit the rapid isolation or separation of biological nanoparticles called exosomes. Exosomes have emerged as highly promising vehicles for targeted drug delivery in personalized medicine. But existing processing methods are too slow to support effective and high throughput drug development. This project is a fundamental study in the manufacture of high-performance microhydrocyclone devices and their application in high throughput exosome separation and collection. The research bridges the fields of manufacturing, microsystems technology and bioengineering. The results of this effort have broad impacts beyond drug development where rapid nanoparticle separations are needed, including the chemical, energy, and biomedical industries, which benefits the U.S. economy. The project expands participation of underrepresented groups and women and introduces K-12 students to research for a positive impact on engineering education.<br/><br/>Exosomes are cell-secreted bio-nanoparticles. Exosomes offer enormous potential for targeted nanotherapeutic delivery, but improved isolation techniques are needed to provide the required processing throughput for drug development. This research studies a novel microhydrocyclone technology, which is capable of increasing the throughput of exosome separations by orders of magnitude over existing methods. The microhydrocyclone design is guided by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling.  The team develops and validates an analytical scaling model of the miniature hydrocyclone separation process. It leverages nanoscale laser direct writing to integrate functional microhydrocyclone devices within thermoplastic microfluidic substrates. A multi-element bandpass concentrator design is developed for size-selective exosome collection. To reduce risk, several features are added to the device such as coating with silica to make it leak-free. The performance of the technology for continuous-flow isolation of exosomes from cell culture supernatant is assessed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this time, STEM graduate education has continued to rely largely on traditional learning models. These learning models historically have not emphasized professional skills development and career exploration, now recognized as key to long-term career success in STEM fields. Many institutions encourage students to address career and professional development needs through optional extra-curricular opportunities. The sporadic nature of these opportunities makes it difficult for students and faculty to learn about programs and to use them for effective learning. Moreover, when professional development and career exploration are not intentionally built into the arc of graduate training and assessed for effectiveness, graduate programs risk poor use of resources and an inconsistent training experience. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Michigan will develop an adaptive professional training (APT) system that will gather opportunities across the institution from different levels (e.g. department, college, university, external) into a single system. The data and knowledge gained from the system will help to guide skill development for graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will test the idea that providing a structured learning framework for professional development guided by formative mentor feedback and artificial intelligence-directed recommendations will enable more effective professional skill-building and student career success.  The proposed platform, the Adaptive Professional Training (APT) learning management system (LMS) will integrate the following key innovations: (1) a user-friendly online hub of learning opportunity listings across the institution and beyond linked with defined by core professional skill competencies, (2) adaptive and iterative learning recommendations tailored to individual needs and interests based on both mentor and trainee input, (3) portfolio building, and (4) program assessment capabilities to enable evidence-based educational policy and resource optimization. This APT LMS represents a new flexible learning paradigm by which diverse professional training opportunities can be intentionally integrated into STEM graduate education. We will test whether use of the APT LMS by a test student cohort, compared to a control student cohort, will promote more intentional time investment in professional development and more uniform improvement in defined competencies, like science communication and increased awareness of learning resources. We predict that this innovative educational approach will integrate student and mentor input, enabling planning, documentation, and engagement in a systematic manner, leading to more effective acquisition of the professional skills associated with student career success. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the factors limiting technological developments in these fields is limited understanding of how ions inject into and transport within these semiconducting plastics. This project addresses this question by analyzing polymers (plastics) at the nanometer scale using advanced microscopy techniques. These methods can determine where polymers are swelling from ion injection and can correlate that response with the chemical signature of the ion using infrared light, also at the nanoscale. The microscopic information is then compared to transistor measurements to gain a fundamental understanding of how the polymer processing and structure influences ion motion. The scientific knowledge from this project enables better design and processing/manufacturing of polymers for the applications noted above. The project additionally builds upon the track record of the principal investigator in education by enabling development of new outreach materials such as polymer electrochemistry kits that are suitable for integration into existing outreach programs and networks. The project also provides direct support for undergraduate research through continuation of the successful partnership with the Rainier Scholars organization to provide pathways to assist under-represented groups and first-generation college students succeed in the sciences. <br/><br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the structure/function relationships controlling ion injection in pi-conjugated polymers operating as mixed ionic/electronic conductors while using blended organic electrochemical transistors as an experimental testbed. These polymers and blends typically exhibit features on the scale of tens of nanometers, and therefore this project uses advanced scanning probe microscopy tools to investigate the ion transport process at the nanoscale. Conjugated polymers have emerged as promising electronic and photonic materials for transducing signals at the interface between the biological and digital environments, and the proposed project will explore fundamental structure/function properties of these materials relevant to these applications in a way that is distinct from other efforts through a combination of unique local and bulk methods. Specifically, the project will: 1) use a new method, photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM), to make nanoscale maps probing how local chemical structure and morphology combine to affect local ion injection; 2) apply electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) to measure local swelling due to ion uptake in homopolymers, block copolymers, and blends; and, 3) do so while exploring new blend and composite architectures as a means to overcome the bottlenecks of existing materials performance. Notably, this project uses nanoscale infrared microscopy to probe blends of conducting polymers and ionic conductors to test the hypothesis that decoupling the high electronic mobility component and high ionic mobility component can enable improved electrochemical transistors. The principal investigator has shown in previous work that ion injection and electronic mobility are often anti-correlated in mixed conductors, which serves as a device bottleneck. These experiments yield a distinct set of measurements that enable multimodal analysis of the structure-function relationships underpinning ion injection. The project provides important insight into how mobility and volumetric capacitance in mixed ionic-electronic conductors are related, and whether it is possible to rationally improve conducting polymers and polymer blends design by focusing on how ions move into the polymer from the ground up.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, taking into account phylogenetic diversity in the restoration of natural vegetation can lead to restorations that establish quicker and are heartier, while understanding the phylogenetics of pathogens can aid in back-tracing the spread of a disease and guiding epidemiological interventions.  While trees are a natural choice for representing evolution combinatorially, by restricting to the class of trees, it is possible to miss more complicated events such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer. For more complete descriptions, phylogenetic networks, directed acyclic graphs, are increasingly becoming more common in evolutionary biology. This project focuses on phylogenetic networks and their parent models, phylogenetic mixture models, and will use applied algebraic geometry, in particular, algebraic statistics, to develop novel techniques for their inference. The project also has research training of graduate students and educational activities that introduce algebraic statistics and algebraic biology to undergraduate and K-12 students. In addition to hosting and running a series of one-week long graduate student research workshops in algebraic biology with follow-up small group collaborations, the PI will design a data-centered undergraduate mathematical biology course and organize annual collaborative and problem-based mathematical events for 6th graders with island-focused challenges.<br/><br/>Since network-based Markov models and their mixtures are specified with a polynomial parameterization, they are amenable to analysis using algebraic and geometric methods. This project will utilize their algebraic properties to establish identifiability, a property necessary for meaningful statistical inference, and then utilize their geometric properties to develop a procedure for network inference.

URM students enroll in and complete PhD degrees in STEM at a much lower rate than majority groups; they also often face what educational researchers refer to as ?climates of intimidation? within higher education and STEM. This project?s goals are to support students? empowerment, agency and authenticity for academic success and social integration into STEM.  This will be accomplished with a training program that translates the evidence-based findings of the learning disabilities communities to promote self-advocacy and positively impact the retention and academic success of URM PhD students. This IGE will address whether teaching self-advocacy increases the academic success, social integration and general well-being of URM PhD STEM students, and thereby lead to improvements in doctoral degree attainment.<br/> <br/>A comprehensive review of evidence-based practices for teaching self-advocacy within the learning disability communities found that there are three critical factors that, when combined, result in increased academic success: empowerment, self-awareness, and social justice. Self-advocacy has been shown to increase students? retention during critical transitions to post-secondary education or increase participation in learning STEM disciplines, while also increasing academic success. Thus, the research hypothesis is that teaching self-advocacy will result in improved academic success, improved social integration, and improved health and well-being for URM STEM graduate students at UIC, many of whom are first generation or low-income. The societal impact of this grant will be a successful graduate education program that is inclusive of URM students and that will inform on a broader scale how to increase participation of URM graduate students in STEM disciplines. It is anticipated that the translation of evidence-based educational practices from the learning disabilities communities will serve as a foundation for teaching self-advocacy to URM STEM graduate students, and further the translation of these practices to other student populations and fields at UIC and other institutions of higher learning that want to increase the academic success of their URM graduate students. This work will also add to the needed scholarship on the factors that impact resilience of URM STEM PhD graduate students and how self-advocacy affects their academic success and health/well-being.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

In this model, the capstone requirement for the STEM PhD is satisfied through the publication of original research in academic journals, where the work must be evaluated favorably by experts through peer-review. In recent years, there has been an increasing participation of STEM PhDs in technology entrepreneurship, through the development of patentable technologies, and the formation of startup companies. The STEM PhD program, as it exists, does not adequately provide this growing proportion of the STEM workforce who are active in entrepreneurship with the necessary professional skills and preparation. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) will introduce a novel approach in which STEM PhD students will develop patentable technologies as the capstone requirement. These innovations will be implemented in a new program called Pathways to Entrepreneurship (PAtENT), which will provide an alternate pathway to earning a doctoral degree that has the potential to spur graduation rates, generate employment in the local communities in which it is deployed, and maintain the nation?s edge in technological innovation. <br/><br/>The central goal of the project will be to develop an alternate roadmap for STEM PhD students that is scalable and reflects the rapidly evolving workforce needs. This goal will be achieved without sacrificing the technical rigor of the traditional PhD program, by subjecting the patent applications to external peer review. An independent evaluator will collect extensive data on the efficacy of the program, and address specific objectives such as the alignment of the roadmap with the core scientific and professional elements required for a PhD, assess the scalability potential of the pilot study, develop recommendations for STEM programs at other doctoral institutions across the country, and measure the participation rates and employment outcomes of under-represented minorities targeted by the program. The evaluation will consist of a mixed-methods design that will include surveys, polls and interviews developed for current students and faculty, and reflective questions for the project leadership. The project will emphasize the recruitment of female and veteran students, groups that are currently under-represented in the technology startup workforce.

Although some remarkable bijections to algebraic objects such as random matrices, Young diagrams and so on have led to a series of breakthroughs in the mathematical verification of some of the predictions, many of the current techniques  based on integrable probability are not sufficient by themselves to analyze some of the fundamental geometric properties of such systems. Continuing an ongoing program to couple the integrable approach with a primarily probabilistic and geometric perspective, the PI lays down a comprehensive  plan to investigate several aspects of such models which will fundamentally improve our understanding and initiate new research directions. The program also has a strong education component including mentoring graduate students and postdocs, and curriculum development at undergraduate and graduate levels, aiming to create multiple advanced research topics courses, and design the probability content in foundational undergraduate courses. Various educational and dissemination strategies including workshop organizing, writing survey articles, teaching summer courses will be carried out as well.  <br/><br/>A canonical model of growth predicted to be in the KPZ universality class is the model of planar Last Passage Percolation (LPP) which puts random weights on the vertices of a planar lattice and considers paths between vertices which accrue maximum weights. Such maximal paths called geodesics are fundamental objects of study. Besides further developing the picture of coalescence of geodesics in LPP models, the project aims to study the entire energy landscape of paths and their associated weights, with a focus on the geometry of almost maximal paths or near geodesics.  The PI will also investigate  interlacing properties of geodesic watermelons (collections of disjoint paths with maximal cumulative weight) and their consequences with connections to various line ensembles and determinantal point processes, as well as large deviation behaviors of geodesics. Finally the program will initiate novel research directions concerning fractal geometry and noise sensitivity, drawing inspiration from seminal works of a similar nature in the context of critical planar percolation and spin glasses. Particular topics include studying Hausdorff dimensions of  various endpoint pairs admitting exceptional geodesic behavior as well as computing exponents marking the onset of chaos in natural dynamical versions of LPP.  As necessary tools, several new theories including discrete harmonic analysis for models in the KPZ universality class will be developed. In particular, this is expected to create a bridge between various communities in probability, mathematical physics and theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All these areas undergird much of science and technology. The public is familiar with probability from everyday life, but often is not aware of how crucial it is in today's economy, for example, or in today's computer algorithms in common smartphone apps. Group theory studies symmetries and lies behind much of modern physics. Analysis is familiar from calculus, invented to study moving bodies and now used throughout science and engineering. Ergodic theory is the least known of these branches of mathematics; it began in physics with the study of systems of many particles, such as gases. It now provides a unifying framework to study many disparate questions, including some in computer science. As one example of these connections to be studied, we recall that in the 19th century, Cayley introduced graphs to represent the algebraic objects known as groups.  It is always desirable to have finite approximations to infinite objects, and the same holds for infinite groups.  Gromov and Weiss suggested a way to use finite networks for this purpose, at least for those groups known as ""sofic"". It is not known how widely this approach works. The PI discovered with Aldous that a probabilistic setting leads to a wider framework for this question and suggests a new approach to it.  If one can actually succeed in making such approximations for all groups, then this would resolve a host of important conjectures in a variety of fields of mathematics.  The PI will continue his work on this question. Graduate students will be trained through research related to this project.<br/><br/>Other directions concern a class of random processes of points, known as determinantal.  These processes were first considered in physics, then found much use in probability theory, and recently have become of interest in computer science (in order to find representative, diverse samples from large data sets).  One of the goals of this project is to understand better how close two determinantal probability measures are when their generating matrices are close. Such a result in the finite case is very likely to extend to the infinite case as well, at least in the infinite ""sofic"" situation. In another direction, random walks are a basic object of study in probability, whether in discrete time or continuous time. The PI has discovered much very puzzling behavior of continuous-time random walks, especially on Cayley graphs. It is proposed to determine whether such puzzling behavior is limited in how much it can contradict intuition. As a final example, the notion of ""factor"" is basic to ergodic theory. Factors maps are very well understood when the acting group is amenable, but not when the group is larger. Yet factors on trees are also important in combinatorics and computer science.  It is proposed to understand better which maps are factors of IID (independent and identically distributed) processes and which are not.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, a broad goal of this project is to understand how cells function reliably and efficiently despite the ubiquity of randomness at the cellular level. In addition, this project will increase STEM participation and train the next generation of scientists to continue the interdisciplinary approach of this research. In particular, graduate students will be closely involved in all aspects of the work and undergraduates who currently lack access to a research mathematics department will be given a preview of research and graduate school as they participate in summer programs.<br/><br/>Cell biology is requiring rapid advances in mathematics, as the data is prompting questions far beyond the limits of existing stochastic processes theory. In the case of T cells interacting with antigens, the PI will develop and apply stochastic models to infer kinetics from raw binary data. In the case of protein-protein interactions, the PI will formulate and analyze a new class of stochastic partial differential equations aimed at uncovering features relating two-dimensional and three-dimensional binding. These models are expected to resolve discrepancies between certain in vivo and in vitro measurements and to show how cells can exploit dimensional-dependent interactions to regulate function. Further, the PI will answer foundational questions in the emerging field of extreme first passage theory. First passage theory has been used extensively to study timescales in biology, but the vast majority of works have focused on the time it takes a given single searcher to find a target. However, the more relevant timescale is often the first passage time of the fastest searcher from a large collection of searchers, as many events in cell biology are initiated by the arrival of the first molecule out of many. The development of extreme first passage theory seeks to discover how redundancy (many copies of proteins, molecules, etc.) affects cellular activation rates and allow a wide range of previous applications of traditional first passage theory to be revised. <br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concretely, the main goal of the project will be to characterize the existence and uniqueness properties of semi-infinite and bi-infinite volume measures (respectively geodesics). The work will also consider related problems, including investigating how infinite volume measures relate to the regularity properties of the limiting free energy (respectively shape function), developing computational tools in exactly solvable models and on understanding the structure of the environment viewed from the perspective of paths drawn from the infinite volume measure (respectively a geodesic).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mandatory courses such as ?Responsible Conduct of Research? (RCR) serve to teach topics in the field of science ethics and integrity at most institutions. Much has been published on improving the pedagogy of research ethics education, however, many RCR courses still focus on describing flawless ethical practice on the one hand and denouncing cases of outright misconduct or fraud on the other. The large grey zone in between, the so-called questionable research practices (QRPs) are rarely taught in a formal manner.

However, before experts testify they first must be admitted into court by trial judges. Given experts? potential to influence court cases and judicial precedent, judges? decisions about which experts to admit and which to exclude are vitally important. The legal framework for these decisions focuses on the scientific qualities of expert evidence, such as its reliability. However, the scientific qualities of specialized expert evidence are difficult for non-experts to judge. This study investigates the social and political factors related to the admissibility of expert evidence in court. Specifically, it examines how social cues such as experts? sex, age, and discipline relate to perceptions of their credibility and the admissibility of their evidence. The findings can inform courts? use of expert evidence by revealing social biases that may interfere with expert admissibility. This research therefore has the potential to improve legal decision making by identifying the social and political factors involved with the entry of expert evidence into court.<br/><br/>The PI and a team of graduate assistants will content-code a large probability sample of written judicial opinions on expert admissibility from federal district courts. Data from judicial opinions will be combined with socio-demographic information about judges and experts not contained in judicial opinions. Statistical analyses of the resulting dataset will provide a comprehensive survey of overall rates and distributions of admissibility challenges and decisions in federal courts. These data will also advance our understanding of how social characteristics of judges and experts relate to the admissibility of expert evidence. Existing theories of expert admissibility prioritize the scientific merit of expert evidence. This project widens the analytic lens to capture the social and political forces that filter perceptions of experts and make some experts seem more credible than others. Understanding the attributes of judges and expert witnesses associated with expert admissibility will help future litigants deploy?and contest?expert evidence more effectively. Better knowledge of these processes will also assist judges in their evaluations of expert evidence when they determine its admissibility, thereby improving the quality of expert evidence allowed into courts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, we still lack a theoretical understanding of when large scale machine learning will work well to discover interesting patterns and structure in data, and when it will fail to do so and overfit. These problems have recently manifested in adversarial hacking of deep neural networks, which poses risks in sensitive applications where data privacy and security are paramount. The objective of this project is to use the theory of partial differential equations and the calculus of variations to study foundational problems in machine learning and data science, and develop new, more efficient, algorithms founded on strong theoretical principles. The project will advance data science education by developing an annual summer school for high school students on graph-based learning, mentoring high-school students from the University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program, developing graduate courses on current research in graph-based learning, and supporting the participation of women and underrepresented groups in all aspects of the project.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to use partial differential equation (PDE) continuum limits for discrete machine learning problems to analyze existing algorithms, develop new algorithms with better performance guarantees, and make new connections between machine learning and PDEs. A major focus of the project is graph-based learning, where discrete learning algorithms on graphs can be interpreted as discretizations of continuum PDEs, and properties of those PDEs (e.g., regularity and well-posedness) convey information about the learning problem and can lead to new algorithms founded on strong theoretical principles. In particular, the project will (1) develop and study a new algorithm, called Poisson learning, for graph-based semi-supervised learning at very low labeling rates, (2) draw new connections between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and viscosity solutions of nonlinear PDEs, showing that SGD has the ability to select good minimizers in ill-posed problems, (3) use ideas from classical elliptic regularity theory to prove interior Lipschitz regularity for solutions of graph-based learning problems on random geometric graphs, (4) prove generalization bounds for graph-based learning in low label-rate regimes, including the active learning setting, and (5) develop a consistency theory for learning problems on directed graphs, such as ranking algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Academic researchers collect and analyze data to advance scientific knowledge. Businesses and policy-makers use data to inform decisions. The nation needs to educate and train more students with deep technical skills in data science and broad interdisciplinary collaboration skills to work with these researchers, businesses, and policy makers to convert data into benefits for society. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Colorado Boulder will test the effectiveness of a new program to educate and train interdisciplinary data scientists who can move between theory and practice to solve problems for real-world impact. This program combines innovative classroom instruction and learning activities in the theory of interdisciplinary collaboration with practical data science experience working on real projects in the Laboratory for Interdisciplinary Statistical Analysis (LISA). Specifically, graduate students will learn how to adopt effective attitudes of collaboration, how to structure effective meetings with domain experts, what to focus on to make deep contributions to the domain, effective communication skills, and how to cultivate strong relationships with their collaborators. At the same time, students will learn how to put this knowledge into practice by collaborating with researchers, businesses, and policy makers to apply data science to solve a wide variety of domain-specific problems for decision-making. Ultimately, this program may lead to a transformation in who can be trained to become data scientists, where they can be trained, and what can be achieved when we transform data into societal benefits. <br/><br/>The goal of this IGE project is to evaluate how effectively the LISA program educates and trains graduate students from a variety of backgrounds to become collaborative data scientists. Specifically, this project will combine assessments of students? technical skills, student self-evaluation surveys, LISA administrative records, domain expert feedback surveys, and independent expert evaluations of students? projects to answer two research questions: <br/>1. To what extent are LISA students effective interdisciplinary data science collaborators? (i.e., how well do they do on their projects compared to historical norms, other cohorts of students, and an expert collaborative data scientist?) <br/>2. What degree of technical preparation in data science is sufficient for graduate students to become effective interdisciplinary data science collaborators? <br/>Knowledge generated from this project may inform best practices across colleges and universities for thousands of graduate students to be educated and trained to become effective interdisciplinary data scientists. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

Toward understanding and engineering biological systems, data are rapidly accumulating on what proteins and what protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are present in such systems, but a major barrier remains as knowledge is limited on how proteins interact in 3-dimensional (3D) space.  This project is designed to help fill the knowledge gap by developing computational methods that predict mechanism-revealing 3D structures formed by PPIs.  While developing such methods, a data-focused yet physics-rationalized approach will be pursued, which is expected to advance the state of the knowledge across natural science and artificial intelligence.  The outcome of the project will facilitate deciphering and engineering genome-wide PPIs for wide applications such as novel therapeutics, clean energy, and smart materials.  The project is also designed with educational activities to promote the awareness, participation, training, and communication of data-driven science discovery for students, educators, domain scientists, and general public.  The highly interdisciplinary research and education activities will be integrated to foster a diverse globally-competitive workforce, including historically underrepresented groups, to be ready for the era of big data.  <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to advance the state of the art for structural PPI prediction and re-think and tackle the problem as explaining how pairs of proteins, represented in various data forms such as texts, graphs, or images, interact under governing physics.  In pursuit of the goal, the research objectives of the project involve three levels of PPI structural prediction of increasing resolutions and challenges: residue-level contact maps, residue-level distance distributions, and atom-level 3D structures.  Initiated by these objectives, novel machine learning algorithms will be developed and contribute to foundational algorithm research, including the effective integration and learning from heterogeneous data as well as the flexible representation and incorporation of domain knowledge.  Such advance in foundational algorithm research will expand the applicability of PPI structural prediction to genome-scale and learn physical principles underlying diverse PPIs rather than ?memorizing? patterns in similar PPIs.  Moreover, such methodological advance is expected to impact broad application fields beyond PPI structural prediction.  The proposed research is integrated with an educational plan by feeding research results and trained personnel to multi-scale education and outreach activities, involving educated students in research, and engaging general public in citizen science.  New curricular and co-curricular activities will be developed to enhance the accessibility to interdisciplinary data-science training for a diverse student body and domain scientists.  Also, multi-level outreach activities in collaboration with existing programs will be used to foster the awareness of and interest in interdisciplinary data science among diverse middle- and high-school students as well as the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Java runtime, or Java Virtual Machine (JVM), has become a software ecosystem on its own. Nowadays, hundreds of popular JVM languages (including Kotlin, Scala, and Groovy) have been developed/adopted under different platforms (including Oracle JDK and Android SDK), build systems (including Gradle and Maven), and JVM implementations (including HotSpot and OpenJ9). For example, Google just promoted Kotlin to the No.1 preferred language for Android development at Google I/O 2019. The huge and heterogeneous ecosystem of JVM raises unique challenges to automated debugging, including both fault localization and repair. <br/><br/>This project proposes to re-think the role of a foundational concept of program mutation, that is, systematic program transformation, in automated debugging. Program mutation has been widely adopted in traditional mutation testing and program repair, and the investigator conjectures, based on preliminary work, that it can be used to transform and advance the state-of-the-art in automated debugging for software written with technologies from the entire JVM ecosystem and beyond. Specifically, the project focuses on the following research thrusts: (1) unifying both fault localization and repair via program mutation to boost each other, (2) automatically inferring up-to-date advanced mutators from big code corpora for maximal unified debugging, since existing program mutators are often limited and may easily become obsolete, (3) developing novel techniques to optimize patch executions for scalable unified debugging, since patch execution can be extremely time-consuming, and (4) supporting unified debugging of the entire heterogeneous JVM ecosystem. The project will unify program mutations across various dimensions for the first time, e.g., across JVM languages and platforms, across code types (including source, test, and build code), and even across JVM boundaries. Ultimately, the project aims for a practical debugging system to benefit JVM ecosystem developers all over the world. The overarching idea of unified debugging can also substantially impact the ways that both researchers and practitioners view, design, and apply automated debugging -- fault localization always requires manual repair while program repair only works for some bugs; in contrast, unified debugging can support the most automated debugging possible for each bug, and broaden the effective range of the entire program repair area to all possible bugs. The project will integrate the research results into SE curriculum, K-12 camps, software testing contests, and industrial collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deep neural networks have shown significant improvements in many AI applications. However, the benefit comes at the high cost of computational resources and engineer resources. For mobile devices with a tight power budget, such high demands for computation become prohibitive. On the other side, there is a shortage of experts who can design neural networks, which are notoriously hard to tune. This project systematically investigates efficient neural network architectures and their hardware accelerators to make them run fast at low power. It also aims to accelerate the design cycle by AI-based design automation (AI-designed AI). Such design methodology can support machine learning research and education,, while significantly improving the productivity of machine learning models. People no longer have to hand-tune the model, but it is automated, enabling non-experts to build efficient machine learning models. It will democratize AI to a more diverse community. <br/><br/>The project aims to auto-generate both efficient neural networks and their hardware implementations that can generalize to high-dimensional representations, through automatic machine learning (AutoML) techniques. It will design a hardware accelerator to provide more computation per unit cost. The algorithm hardware co-design approach unveils a larger design space that conventional wisdom has been limited to. It is expected to shorten the design cycle of neural architecture search by two orders of magnitude over existing work. With AutoML, powerful hardware, and the co-designed efficient algorithms, it is possible to solve more challenging AI tasks on high-dimensional data that are previously difficult or impossible, hindered by the computation resource, such as videos and 3D point clouds. These techniques give rise to a deeper understanding of the high dimensional representations and produce state-of-the-art neural network architectures that can efficiently run on mobile devices as well as protect user privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last several decades have given rise to two opposing trends in the computing industry. At the software level, a desire for simplicity, reusability, and programmer productivity has pushed the level of abstraction in software to higher levels, removing most programmers from the burden of understanding the underlying machine. At the hardware level, the demand for both performance and energy-efficiency has led to the development of programmable hardware accelerators. However, the effort required to port abstract programs to accelerators is a significant barrier to their adoption, particularly for generalist programmers that have little desire to create un-portable, accelerator-specific code. This project aims to address these challenges in tandem by developing novel cross-stack techniques to accelerate productive software on efficient hardware. The project aims to increase the number of individuals and problems that can benefit from energy-efficient, accelerated computing. An integrated education plan introduces K-12 students to acceleration through graphics accelerators and video games while teaching college undergraduates and graduates to think about how problems map to accelerators by thinking spatially.<br/><br/>Concretely, this project focuses on ameliorating the overheads associated with well-established software principles that increase programmer productivity and finding innovative ways to improve hardware accelerators to support productive practices. The project first explores new optimization opportunities in massively parallel, object-oriented code where object data layout and the high cost of invoking virtual functions degrade performance. The project will develop lightweight, virtual function elision mechanisms, parallelism-aware compilation passes, an accelerator-aware virtual memory system, and a coordinated cross-stack effort to reduce memory pressure.

Challenges ranging from understanding climate change, to discovering new materials for solar cells, to curing cancer, depend on the power of leadership-class supercomputing resources. Resources of this class cost tens of millions to set up and operate, so the scientific applications using them should produce the largest scientific advancement possible, in the shortest amount of time, using the least amount of energy. However, scientific applications operate inefficiently in that they typically perform operations at less than 30 percent of the potential maximum rate, and often further less than that. Hand-optimizing scientific applications by rewriting the code can increase the operation rate, but also introduces code complexities that make code difficult to understand and maintain, impeding scientific progress. Automated code optimization preserves code maintainability and has the potential to significantly increase operation rates. However, there are obstacles, such as the use of shared mathematical libraries that block automated optimization. This project seeks to overcome key obstacles to automated code optimization for scientific applications. An integrated education plan will engage at-risk youth from local Idaho high schools in computer science, building on a successful pilot program that brought pregnant and parenting teens together with computer science students.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to unblock memory optimizations that depend on a code transformation performed by compilers called function inlining that is crucial to subsequent code transformation. Interactions with memory are expensive and application designers depend on them to support software design patterns. Application designers often use library calls or function pointers to break software into small, reusable modular components. However, doing so prevents inlining and limits the efficacy of transformations contributing to memory optimizations. In response to this problem, the project will make function bodies available earlier and in a form that is amenable to transformations. To accomplish this, the project will develop a new early linking stage using a high-level compiler internal representation, resulting in large regions of application code expressed in a structure ideal for transformation. This approach allows for inlining and subsequent loop transformations, thus removing the barrier resulting from using precompiled libraries, and some of the barriers from function pointer use. Project objectives are to: (1) enable inlining of precompiled libraries, (2) enable inlining over function pointers, and (3) provide customized optimization planning.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by CCF Division Software and Hardware Foundations Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The summer culminates with presentations (at Williams and often at conferences), and most groups write up their work for submission to a research journal. There are weekly talks by faculty and students, both in mathematics and in related fields. Students are part of a vibrant scientific community; over 100 students do original research in mathematics and the sciences at Williams each summer, and there are a variety of academic and social activities bringing all the summer students and faculty together. Now in its fourth decade, participants are connected with alumni of the program who are able to provide excellent perspective, advice, and mentorship.<br/> <br/>The goal of this REU is to introduce undergraduates to the excitement and challenge of doing original research in mathematics. Topics will be drawn from a variety of fields. Possible areas include algebraic geometry, Bayesian statistics, combinatorics, commutative algebra, computational geometry, CR structures, discrete geometry, dynamics and ergodic theory, graph theory, hyperbolic manifolds, knot theory, mathematical biology, mathematical physics, measure theory, minimal surfaces, number theory, probability, random matrix theory, representation theory, Riemannian geometry, symmetry groups, and tropical geometry. In the process, students learn lots of background material. They typically work in groups, meeting with advisors as needed, and are encouraged to present as well as publish their work, all valuable skills for graduate school as well as non-academic pursuits. A variety of mathematical activities and topics provides a rich intellectual environment; students live together and are constantly discussing their work, and attend weekly talks by the faculty so they learn the basics of all the different areas being investigated that summer.  Our nation needs a wider appreciation and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out.  We have increased the numbers of students from traditionally under-represented groups participating in the program over the last five years, as well as from community college backgrounds, and we are continuing to look for new and better ways to encourage applications from women, minorities, first generation college students, and other underrepresented groups.  Students, faculty and the broader mathematics community will benefit from the presentation and publication of original research.

Importantly today's students must gain a fundamental understanding of AI in order to be prepared to enter the workforce of the future. This project will design a 12-lesson high school curriculum called StoryQ and associated teaching guides that will provide students with firsthand experience on how narrative modeling, one of the oldest fields in artificial intelligence, can be developed while working on their language arts writing projects. By integrating age-appropriate mathematics, language arts, and computing concepts, researchers will leverage advanced data exploration and text mining technologies, and employ research-based pedagogical approaches to help high school students learn basic concepts in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. <br/><br/>Led by a multidisciplinary team of learning technology and data experts, machine learning researchers, and experts in the integration of narrative modeling and mathematics learning, the project will focus on helping students envision their future careers as powered by artificial intelligence. The researchers will create and test StoryQ, a web-based text mining and narrative modeling platform, and develop, implement, and test narrative modeling with StoryQ curriculum. Students will learn to design, build, test, and iteratively improve machine learning models of narratives sourced both from student and teacher selected literature and from students? own writings. Beginning with core narrative concepts, students will engage in development cycles that lead them to explore their own writing, annotate models by hand, observe a trained text mining model at work, become familiar with error analysis, and ultimately build their own AI model and evaluation process. The project broadens participation among youth from underrepresented and underserved populations by recruiting participants from two Massachusetts school districts with ethnically and economically diverse populations. To create broadly inclusive learning experiences, students from diverse backgrounds will write narratives to express their cultures and personalities as part of the learning activities. Research questions include (1) How can learning environments be designed to help students understand core AI concepts including the structures in unstructured data and the roles of human insight in the development of AI technologies? and (2) How can learning environments be designed to help students develop awareness and interest in careers that are centered on text mining practices or broadly powered by AI technologies? The project will use a design-based research design. The research team will carry out class observations and in-depth analysis of observational data, and draw design principles for building learning environments that cultivate future STEM and ICT workforce. The project?s success will be evaluated by a group of external evaluators who are experts in diversity and inclusion in AI, computing education, mathematics education, and language arts and literacy education.

Automated program-analysis and -verification technology aims to increase reliability, with minimal developer effort, by providing software developers with tools to answer questions about the behavior of their code. Since nearly all such questions are undecidable, progress in program-analysis technology over the last fifty years has been driven by heuristic reasoning techniques. These heuristics are often effective in practice, but they can be brittle and exhibit counter-intuitive behavior, making program analyzers to difficult to use.  This project investigates the question: how can program-analysis tools be defined whose behavior can be understood and altered by software developers?<br/><br/>This project builds foundations for usable program-analysis tools in order to deliver behavioral and performance guarantees that software developers may rely upon.  It revisits three core program-analysis tasks -- numerical-invariant generation, termination analysis, and shape analysis -- and develops dependable reasoning principles to replace heuristics.  The project contributes new program-analysis algorithms and new automated theorem-proving technology to support these analyses.  By improving usability, the project aims to increase the scope and impact of program analysis, with the ultimate goal of creating better, more reliable software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivated by the need to model socio-technical interactions in engineering design, this research combines design theory with network science to explore three interrelated topics: 1) two-stage multidimensional network models for customer preference modeling that consider product associations and social influence; 2) dynamic network models for predicting the impact of multi-competitor strategic decisions, and 3) knowledge transfer to demonstrate generalizability and creation of shared data resources to benefit research community. This project will advance design theories of complex systems and develop quantitative methods for modeling socio-technical interactions in engineering design. Integrated with enterprise-driven design, the methods developed will enhance US industry?s competitiveness within changing markets. The test cases include a primary case study on the design of electric vehicles and small SUVs and a secondary case study on the design of household products. The project will also foster student training in data science, network science and Artificial Intelligence, with particular emphasis on the participation of underrepresented groups, females, and undergraduates.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research is manifested in four aspects. First, the hierarchical network model studies customers? consideration and choice as distinct, but integrated, behaviors. It identifies distinctive driving factors underlying the consideration and choice stages. Second, this research overcomes the practical challenges of missing data on customers' social networks. The solution relies on an innovative approach to assess how individuals? preferences are influenced by their own egocentric social contacts through a synergistic integration of autologistic actor attribute model (ALAAM) with the Multidimensional Customer-Product Network (MCPN) framework. Third, using temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (t-ERGM), the dynamic network modeling approach will allow the prediction of future market competition considering the present competition structure and multi-competitor design decisions.

Because humans frequently change speeds while walking, it is important to understand how these speed changes occur and for the exoskeleton to provide appropriate assistance during both steady and variable speed walking. Thus, the objective of this CAREER project is to determine if the human goal, i.e., the human?s subconscious thoughts about the best way to walk, is the same for constant speed walking, changing speeds, and exoskeleton assisted walking for both healthy and post-stroke individuals.  This will be accomplished by developing a physics-based predictive computer model of human walking that includes deriving a mathematical function that describes the subconscious goal of human walking.  Studies are designed to provide fundamental insight into human gait control and to provide a tool to design optimal exoskeleton controllers. The integrated educational plan will use the appeal of exoskeletons to humanize engineering by producing professional videos highlighting how engineering can help improve impaired walking. An exoskeleton-based project will be developed to improve undergraduate engineers' ability to model a system, something with which many students struggle. <br/><br/>The principal investigator's overarching research goal is to study how people walk and to use that knowledge to improve rehabilitation techniques for individuals who have trouble walking.  Towards this goal, this CAREER project will determine if the human goal is the same for constant speed walking, changing speeds, and exoskeleton assisted walking for both healthy and post-stroke individuals, which will provide fundamental insight into human gait control and a tool to design optimal exoskeleton controllers. Novel physics-based (sagittal six-link model with revolute hip, knee, and ankle joints connecting the thighs, shanks, and feet), predictive models will be developed that can account for the highly nonlinear and non-intuitive nature of human-device interaction and create controllers that correctly account for this interaction.  The models developed will better predict human gait, including transition between speeds, and quantify how people change walking speed.  Model development requires determination of an objective function that mathematically describes the subconscious goal of human walking. Initially, the objective will be based on the assumption that humans minimize energetic effort while walking.  If minimum effort does not correlate well with chosen gaits, incorporating fall risk into the function will be considered. Participants in the studies include healthy young adults (30), healthy elderly adults (12), slow elderly adults (12), and post-stroke elderly adults (12) who walk with difficulty but are able to walk without an assistive device and can follow directions. The Research Plan is organized under four tasks:  1) Quantify the spatial-temporal (step length, duration and speed) and kinematic properties of speed transitions for young, elderly, and post-stroke adults for the first time, and generate human-like speed transitions for the model by combining several methods from robotic control in a novel manner; 2) Determine if the same objective function can predict healthy human joint kinematics for steady, variable speed, and exoskeleton-assisted walking, providing novel insights into how humans react to exoskeleton assistance; 3) Determine how advanced age and stroke alter the objective function used to predict walking, providing novel insights into how age and stroke affect walking priorities and 4) Create a method to design exoskeleton controllers in simulation that accounts for the nonlinear human-device interactions and produces the desired human gait without additional tuning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coupled physics processes driven by engineered stimulation of the subsurface underlie many emerging technologies germane to advanced geo-infrastructures; examples include sustainable energy mining from enhanced geothermal systems and intelligent mitigation of the affiliated environmental impacts. Optimal design and closed-loop control of such operations require real-time feedback on the nature of progressive variations in the target subterranean regions. 3D in-situ tracking of multiphysics processes in such environments is, however, exceptionally challenging; engineered treatments (such as fluid or gas injection) are often induced in a complex domain whose structure and material properties are unknown (or uncertain) across multiple scales. Nevertheless, existing approaches to in-situ monitoring mostly rely on simplistic characterization of the subsurface, and mainly ignore the multiscale and coupled-physics nature of the induced processes in data inversion. Moreover, these tools are by and large computationally expensive and inapplicable for real-time sensing, or only amenable to ad hoc sensory configurations. Therefore, there exists a critical need for fast (yet robust) holistic data processing tools that transcend some of these limitations. In light of the fast-paced developments in sensing instruments, furnishing high-resolution spatiotemporal measurements and big data sets, such advances in data analytics is paramount for engineered systems of the future.<br/><br/>The research component of this project aims to establish a comprehensive (analytical, computational, and experimental) platform for: (1) real-time geometric reconstruction of advancing interfaces and volumetric process zones in multiphasic subterranean domains of a-priori unknown properties, (2) high-fidelity hydro-mechanical characterization of thus-recovered regions, and (3) verification and validation of these developments in a laboratory setting for better understanding of injection-induced multiphasic variations in randomly fractured rock masses pertinent to enhanced geothermal systems. This will be accomplished by taking advantage of the most recent advances in applied mathematics, geophysics, biomedical engineering, and sensor technology. In particular, the inverse solution is built upon three fundamental lynchpins: (i) inverse scattering and the theory of transmission eigenvalues, (ii) Marchenko integral equations and the generalized autofocusing concept, and (iii) non-iterative solutions to full-field inversion. The education component of this project aims at: (1) integration of the interdisciplinary knowledge underpinning state-of-the-art data processing tools for complex environments into the curriculum of science and engineering students at CU-Boulder and outreach activities, and (2) cultivating an effective knowledge transfer from research to academia and practice that includes all the stakeholders. In this vein, a three-tier educational program will be developed, involving: (i) engineering outreach to K-12 students with emphasis on underrepresented minorities, (ii) introducing WISE: wave-based inversion in subterranean environments as a new thrust in the engineering program at CU Boulder, and (iii) multilateral collaborations among scientists, engineers, and practitioners at regional, national and international levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key requirement for imagers supporting wireless imaging is that they should draw very low power from battery source such that the battery lasts a long time, since the imagers used for environmental monitoring are typically deployed in locations without access to wired power source. In order to understand the power requirement, operation of wireless imager can be divided into 2 phases ? 1) image acquisition and 2) transmission of image over the wireless network. Recent advances in CMOS imager techniques has significantly reduced power consumption during image acquisition phase. However, image transmission still consumes several orders of magnitude higher energy than image acquisition which limits battery life to few weeks. The project will result in ultra-low power wireless CMOS imagers that can run from standard battery source for several months instead of just weeks. While the specific research aims of this project relate to wireless imagers, the same principles can be extended to design high energy-efficiency edge devices for internet-of-things (IoT) and wearable healthcare. The fundamental research topics addressed in this project is likely to appeal to broad set of students and will be leveraged by the investigator for outreach programs involving high school and undergraduate students to motivate them to pursue graduate studies in STEM fields.<br/><br/>To reduce high energy consumed during image transmission, this project will leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce energy transmission by adopting the following two-pronged approach: a) compress raw images, and b) transmit images only upon identification of object-of-interest. Analog circuit design techniques will be used to implement the AI algorithms in hardware at very low area and energy cost. The project has three components ? 1) development of AI algorithms to reduce transmission power, 2) design of circuits to implement the AI algorithms on-chip, and 3) validation of the project aims. A multi-task learning AI model will be developed which will perform two shared tasks within the same neural network ? a) compress the raw image, b) identify object-of-interest (target animal species in natural habitat) and only transmit compressed image of the object-of-interest. To suppress non-idealities associated with analog design, a hardware-software co-design methodology will be used in which physical transistor models are incorporated into the offline AI model training phase to greatly suppress deviations between software training and hardware implementation results. The project will result in a CMOS chip with the AI model embedded  and will be tested with images of wildlife from publicly available dataset (such as CIFAR-100).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In both cases, this ice can deform, allowing the rock glacier to slowly move downhill.  When rock glaciers extend to lower, warmer elevations, or when summer temperatures rise, this ice melts and water is released to feed streams and wetlands.  This project will investigate how much water is coming out of the hundreds of rock glaciers in two mountain ranges in Utah that are important contributors of water to the Colorado River system, the Uinta Mountains and the La Sal Mountains.  Undergraduate students at Middlebury College will be directly involved in all aspects of the field and laboratory research.  These students will also participate in mentoring of students at Terra Academy, a public high school in northeastern Utah.<br/><br/>Previous work has demonstrated that rock glaciers alter the timing and amount of runoff in high-elevation watersheds and serve as an important component of late summer baseflow. There is also evidence that thawing of permafrost within rock glaciers is releasing meltwater formerly archived as perennial ice.  If the ice reservoir within rock glaciers is eliminated, then there may be less water available for these watersheds in the future.  This project will test the hypothesis that melting of formerly perennial ice within rock glaciers is contributing unsustainably to the hydrology of high-elevation watersheds.  Techniques will include a combination of satellite-based radar interferometry for monitoring rock glacier movement; deployment of dataloggers for recording the temperature of rock glacier surfaces and water discharges; sequential sampling and hydrochemical characterization of rock glacier discharge waters; dating of rock glacier melt water; and ground penetrating radar surveying to identify internal ice.  This project will provide numerous opportunities for involvement and training of undergraduate students in cutting-edge research methods.

Ecosystem-based protections near waterbodies, such as living shorelines, oyster reef and mangrove forest, are increasingly sought to enhance resilience to these climatic hazards; however, restoration projects and ecosystem-based defenses often fail because current understanding of erosion and sediment transport is based on simplified models of non-vegetated channels. This research will develop new scientific knowledge to illuminate effects of three-dimensional canopies (oyster reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves) on turbulent flow, movement of sediments, and sequestration of Blue Carbon (peat deposits). Using both laboratory flume and field experiments, the PI will test novel sediment transport theory within these complex natural habitats. Societal benefits of better understanding of erosional processes at vegetated river banks and shorelines are vast and transferable to aquatic systems around the world, allowing managers of vulnerable areas to plan impactful restoration projects and management strategies to mitigate effects of flooding, bank erosion, or sea level rise. The project will engage diverse students in an experiential ?boots in-the-mud? study of aquatic systems by integrating research and field-based learning with classroom instruction at a variety of educational levels, including middle/high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and professionals. A Living Ecohydraulics Laboratory on an island in the field study area is where the next generation of student scientists will be trained at the intersection of ecology and engineering. <br/><br/><br/>This research will develop and test cutting-edge sediment transport theory, elucidating the roles of shear stress and turbulence on mass transport within diverse, complex aquatic habitats. In the field, the PI will test the hydrodynamic and sediment transport effects of 1) submerged, rigid canopies of oyster, 2) submerged, flexible canopies of seagrasses, and 3) emergent canopies of mangrove. Mass transport within these functionally diverse canopy types will be related to turbulence through field-coupled laboratory experimentation. Better understanding of shear stress-turbulence relationships for sediment transport across varied canopy types and flow regimes will fundamentally change the way that sediment transport is modeled in complex canopies and will significantly advance predictive ability regarding erosional and depositional processes in natural waterbodies.  Newly-developed sediment transport understanding will be linked to its applications in ecosystem restoration and design of nature-based infrastructure to promote greater resilience to climatic hazards. Educational activities include establishment of an island Living Ecohydraulics Laboratory to engage over 1400 learners and immerse 250 students into aquatic research sites over the life of the project. The integrated research-educational field experiences are targeted at influential academic stages, including middle-high school science research programs and summer camps, to attract and retain students who may have otherwise not chosen STEM careers.

However, as software continues to increase in size and complexity, program analysts and software engineers find it increasingly challenging to keep computer software secure, reliable, and safe. To do so, they use what is called software verification. Program invariants are an essential part of software verification; they are summaries of possible program behaviors. Unfortunately, current methods for computing program invariants are not keeping pace with software complexity, resulting in approaches that do not scale well, or which compute imprecise, i.e., weak program invariants. In addition, while better strategies for developing program invariants are available, they are too difficult for most engineers to apply without highly specialized training. This project will produce novel techniques to overcome these limitations to compute strong program invariants, and to do so far more easily. Since program invariants touch on so many parts of software engineering such as generating, debugging, verifying, and optimizing computer code, improved accuracy and efficiency can transform software development. In addition, the investigator at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho will work closely with regional industry professionals both to enhance their verification training, as well as to collaborate in co-developing a graduate-level class on applied program analysis.<br/><br/>The project will use an approach for computing program invariants called abstract interpretation. Key to effective abstract interpretation is choosing an appropriate abstraction level for static code analysis. On the one hand, if the abstraction is too fine, it will not scale well. On the other hand, if the abstraction is too coarse, it will compute weak invariants. This project will result in a novel approach for finding suitable abstractions that allows for a scalable, precise, and far more accessible method of computing program invariants. The resulting Search-based Static Analysis (SBSA) framework will significantly improve upon current static analysis methods and use search techniques to automatically optimize abstract interpreter configurations. It will also facilitate new research directions that require strong program invariants. There are three project objectives, to: (1) investigate search techniques to find the best abstract domain, (2) explore mechanisms for guiding the abstract domain search based on software concrete semantics, and (3) improve precision by strategically partitioning software into components and then analyzing them separately to enable better search.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to combine the individual strengths of both areas to expand the set of mathematical tools that can be brought to bear upon the study of geometry and information theory. An important goal of the project is the practical applications of results and insights gained through such a study.

However, software configurability opens the door to misconfiguration vulnerabilities, which are invalid settings that expose software weaknesses.  Misconfiguration is one of the most critical and common security risks.  Real-world software, however, can have an enormous number of possible configurations and often lacks explicit information about what configurations are secure, leaving users to find and validate configuration settings manually. Compounding the problem, a complete computing system may combine hundreds or thousands of software packages whose configuration settings interact unexpectedly.  The goal of this project is to automate the creation of valid configurations that are reliable and secure.  As the world increasingly depends on smart infrastructure and Internet-of-Things devices to enhance lives, this research will benefit society by improving the reliability and security of the configurable software used in these computing devices.  The research topics, results, and materials from this award will be used in education and training as well as outreach aimed at broadening participation in computing.<br/><br/>This project consists of four tasks that take the foundational first steps towards making software configuration reliable and secure. The first task is the development of a unified configuration language for configuration specifications that are explicit, well-defined, and amenable to formal modeling.  To bootstrap support for existing software, this task will develop new algorithms to automatically extract specifications from known configuration mechanisms.  The second task is an optimizing compiler for the unified configuration language that produces formal logic, so that checking secure configurations is equivalent to Boolean satisfiability.  Algorithms for sampling and searching for valid configurations will also be developed to provide the basis for testing and security applications.  The third task is a set of new techniques for testing highly-configurable software.  This project will develop static analyses to localize defects to precise configurations and search-based algorithms to explore the space of valid configurations for software bugs.  The fourth task is the development of new algorithms that automatically discover secure configurations, because a valid configuration may be bug-free but still violate a user's security policy.

Neurological diseases, such as Parkinson?s disease and Alzheimer?s disease, and injuries can result from faulty or interrupted signaling between networks of brain cells. The development of implanted electrodes, which are medical devices capable of ?write-in? or ?read-out? of electrical signals to and from the brain, has significantly improved the treatment and understanding of these neurological diseases and injuries.  However, following implantation, the body recognizes the implanted device as a foreign object. The tissue response to the implant often results in a build-up of scar tissue and loss of signal-generating cells surrounding the device. This, in turn, is believed to contribute to a loss of function of the implant over time. This CAREER project seeks to answer fundamental questions regarding the tissue response to electrodes implanted in the brain: what are the critical biological events that most strongly impact long-term device performance, and how are they influenced by design features of the electrodes? To answer these questions, new techniques in molecular biology will be applied to reveal biological markers that can predict device performance; then device design choices will be systematically tested to determine the influence of materials and dimensions on these markers.  As a result, the project is expected to deliver new understanding of how to design implanted electrodes with optimized biocompatibility and performance.  The complementary educational objectives of the project are to strengthen the new graduate curricula in biomedical engineering at Michigan State University through the development of novel assessments of the success of the program, while creating a new peer-mentoring program for undergraduate women interested in entering the field of biomedical engineering.  <br/><br/>The Investigator?s long-term research goal is to create fully integrated neural electrode-tissue interfaces.   Towards this goal, the goal of this CAREER project is to develop new approaches to understand and control biological responses to brain implants, which are believed to be a key limitation to device function, stability, and lifespan.  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives.   The FIRST Objective is to identify biomarkers of device-tissue interaction through RNA-sequencing.  Laser capture microscopy (LCM) will be used to excise selected portions of brain tissue for extraction of RNA and subsequent sequencing to provide a comprehensive view of possible changes in gene expression induced by single shank, non-functional silicon-based devices implanted in the motor cortex of adult rats.  Results will be compared to contralateral tissue samples receiving an insertion injury only (to control for ?stab? wound effects), which will enable identification of a subset of genes that will be further screened  as potentially key biomarkers of long-term chronic performance.  The SECOND Objective is to test biomarker effects on signal detection through knockdown of the three gene expressions that were the most highly differentially expressed at the interface relative to control in the first objective.  Knockdown will be via stable, viral-mediated expression surrounding functional, 16-channel, single-shank silicon microelectrode arrays implanted in the motor cortex of rats.  Changes will be  assessed in terms of the number of ?units? detected per device, longevity of detected unit activity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and amplitude of units and local field potentials, in comparison to contralateral control tissue treated with an empty vector.  The THIRD Objective is to define design rules via systematic tests of electrode materials and feature sizes.  Planar style, single shank arrays, will be fabricated from silicon, Parylene, polycrystalline diamond and polydimethylsiloxane.   The impact of device dimensions, Young?s modulus, bending stiffness, and feature size on both traditional histological measures and the expression of biomarkers identified in the first two objectives will be tested. These results will provide guidance on design parameters that should be pursued to optimize the biointegration of electrodes with the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Common criticisms of districting plans include unequal district populations, a lack of contiguity or compactness, the needless splitting of counties (or other political subdivisions), or the use of demographic characteristics of the population to ensure anomalous representation. The challenge of neutrally designing districting plans leads to many questions about baselines and tradeoffs. This project addresses these challenges through optimization methods that provide a mathematically sound, transparent approach. Current optimization formulations lead to very large problems that cannot be solved using existing methods. This research will: (i) investigate methods for establishing the limits of what is possible in a redistricting plan, and (ii) provide politically neutral methods that can inform the public about how well various constraints can restrain manipulation. The three components of the education plan will serve to excite students about a career in operations research. The PI will engage and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in the research. Students from underrepresented populations will actively be sought to work on the project, in part, through collaboration with the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. <br/><br/>Existing exact models for redistricting do not scale well. Even the best of them begin to struggle on county-level instances of redistricting due, in part, to the large number of variables defining these models. To satisfy critical population-equality constraints requires a finer level of granularity, which results in an even larger problem. This research considers new models and algorithms that have the potential to handle significantly larger instances. This is enabled, in part, by the newly researched Arborescence Models, which exploit planar graph duality to simultaneously achieve small size and remarkable strength. Some of the researched techniques for handling contiguity and compactness constraints, e.g., length-bounded cuts, are new and require few or no additional variables. These methods go well beyond the many existing approaches based on multi-commodity flows or layered graphs. Investigation of these methods have the potential to enable new solutions to network problems that have distance, latency, and compactness constraints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivated by the need to model socio-technical interactions in engineering design, this research combines design theory with network science to explore three interrelated topics: 1) two-stage multidimensional network models for customer preference modeling that consider product associations and social influence; 2) dynamic network models for predicting the impact of multi-competitor strategic decisions, and 3) knowledge transfer to demonstrate generalizability and creation of shared data resources to benefit research community. This project will advance design theories of complex systems and develop quantitative methods for modeling socio-technical interactions in engineering design. Integrated with enterprise-driven design, the methods developed will enhance US industry?s competitiveness within changing markets. The test cases include a primary case study on the design of electric vehicles and small SUVs and a secondary case study on the design of household products. The project will also foster student training in data science, network science and Artificial Intelligence, with particular emphasis on the participation of underrepresented groups, females, and undergraduates.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research is manifested in four aspects. First, the hierarchical network model studies customers? consideration and choice as distinct, but integrated, behaviors. It identifies distinctive driving factors underlying the consideration and choice stages. Second, this research overcomes the practical challenges of missing data on customers' social networks. The solution relies on an innovative approach to assess how individuals? preferences are influenced by their own egocentric social contacts through a synergistic integration of autologistic actor attribute model (ALAAM) with the Multidimensional Customer-Product Network (MCPN) framework. Third, using temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (t-ERGM), the dynamic network modeling approach will allow the prediction of future market competition considering the present competition structure and multi-competitor design decisions.

The result is an added mass effect that variably changes the system frequencies, which protects the structure by disrupting harmful interactions between the structure and applied dynamic loads. This mechanism of protection differs significantly from current state-of-the-art passive structural control methods that seek to mitigate damage with precisely tuned devices or dissipate energy through dampers or devices designed to absorb damage.

Due to their light weight and high strength, metal matrix composites are increasingly used in automotive, aerospace, electronics packaging and thermal management applications. Attaining both high strength and high toughness is an essential requirement for many structural applications. However, it is a significant challenge for metal matrix composites to have both. Nature-evolved, damage-tolerant materials such as nacre, bone and wood are both strong and tough because of their hierarchical composite structure. Unlike bone and wood, which have complex microstructures, nacre exhibits superior mechanical properties with a simple composite microstructure. The toughness of nacre is three orders of magnitude higher than that of its main constituent aragonite owing to its hierarchical ?brick-and-mortar? microstructure. This project investigates a novel manufacturing technique to engineer nacre- or bio-inspired three-dimensional metal-graphene composites. This research develops computational and experimental capabilities to understand the strengthening and toughening mechanisms in these materials. This project greatly impacts the metal matrix composites industry. The research is complemented by an educational and outreach program involving curriculum development, research training and engaging K-12 students and the general public. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to manufacture next-generation, damage-tolerant metal matrix composites for mission-critical applications. The research plan is to understand the evolution of the ?brick-and-mortar? microstructure in three-dimensional metal-graphene composites as a function of manufacturing process parameters. The fabrication of the ?brick-and-mortar? structure involves assembling sucrose-coated copper platelets in a three-dimensional structure, converting sucrose into a graphene network by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and consolidating the assembly by hot pressing into a composite. An objective of this project is to study the strengthening and toughening mechanisms of strain hardening, deformation twinning, crack deflection and crack bridging as functions of the ?brick-and-mortar? microstructure, i.e., copper platelet diameter and thickness, and thickness of the continuous graphene film. The fundamental understanding of the strengthening and toughening mechanisms through molecular dynamics simulations and mechanical testing guides the manufacture of nacre-inspired metal-graphene composite structures. The correlation between processing, microstructure and properties establishes the rational design of the metal-matrix manufacturing process. The bio-inspired composite manufacturing technique can be extended to other metal-graphene composites, e.g., using aluminum, magnesium, nickel, titanium, and their alloys as metal matrices.

Conventional light sources such as incandescent light bulbs and fluorescence light tubes consume a lot of energy. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a new generation lighting technology have extremely long life spans and consume much less energy. Despite rapid advances, LED technology is still in its early stage, and continued innovation and breakthroughs are needed to achieve the full potential of this technology. White LEDs are typically obtained by coating yellow luminescence materials (called ?phosphor?) onto blue LEDs. The lack of red component results in a cool color, which is not suitable for indoor lighting applications. The objective of this CAREER project is to develop highly efficient, environmentally friendly luminescent materials by using earth-abundant elements and low-cost and large-scale solution-based methods to replace the yellow phosphors. The project aims to develop highly efficient white LEDs with superior color quality, to speed up the widespread adoption of white LEDs, and to save energy. This project offers educational training in multidisciplinary areas such as Physics, Material Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering for both undergraduate and graduate students. The research is also integrated with photonic education activities at local K-12 schools.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>Metal halide perovskites are promising semiconductor materials for potential applications in optoelectronic devices.

STM produced the first images of single atoms on a surface. Around the same time, it was discovered that light signals emitted from a vibrating molecule could be amplified more than a million times if the molecule was on the tip of a nanometer-scale metal tip.  In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Nan Jiang of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago is developing a state-of-the-art technique that combines scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to study bond stretching in an individual molecule with angstrom-scale spatial resolution (an angstrom is one hundred millionths of a centimeter). Using his TERS technique, Professor Jiang and his students study how individual molecules align relative to each other on surfaces. The Jiang research group seeks to uncover the details of how single molecules interact with surfaces.  This research may ultimately provide fundamental knowledge that will able the control of surface-supported molecular structures and reactions. As part of this CAREER project, Professor Jiang and his group are bringing the excitement of chemistry research opportunities to community college and local high school students by offering them hands-on research experience in physical chemistry at the single molecule level. Dr. Jiang improves the participation of undergraduate students in experimental chemistry research by establishing a One-Week Physical Chemistry Workshop at UIC. In this workshop, Chicago City Colleges students from diverse backgrounds are exposed to scientific career paths.  Dr. Jiang's group provides handheld Raman equipment to community college students in the Chicago area with online training materials and data analysis procedures. This sharing of equipment and data enriches the general chemistry laboratory experience.<br/><br/>This project focuses on interrogating the mechanisms of forming and breaking chemical bonds at the angstrom-scale in various chemical environments using novel approaches. The combination of STM imaging with the detailed chemical information provided by Raman spectroscopy allows the interactions between organic adsorbates and specific binding sites on solid surfaces to be probed with spatial and spectroscopic resolution. Furthermore, Raman one-dimensional (1D) line profiles and two-dimensional (2D) mapping achieved with angstrom-scale spatial resolution provide the location of these vibrational modes on the surface, and hence, define the interactions between these molecules and specific binding sites. Detailed mechanistic studies of the elementary steps of surface-supported structure formation are expected to lead to improvements in designing new atom- and energy-efficient materials and molecular assemblies with tailored chemical properties. The students engaged in this research and education project gain valuable experience in both scanning microscopy and optical spectroscopy, as well as quantum mechanics theory calculations which aid in the interpretation of experimental data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to develop new theory for such random graph processes, in order to better understand their properties, improve existing methods of analysis, and rigorously justify their applications. In doing so, the proposed research addresses long-standing open questions in phase transition of dependent random graph processes. The goal of this research is to show that a variety of dependent random graph processes exhibit similar phase transition behavior. Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering. The educational component includes annual K-12 math teacher workshops, research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students,and a multidisciplinary workshop/summer school for junior researchers and undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the development of new theory and applications for time-evolving random graph processes with dependencies (that grow step-by-step according to specific rules or structural constraints). One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To support this goal, colleges and universities provide numerous forms of student support intended to increase the retention and graduation rates of its undergraduate engineering students (e.g., peer mentoring programs). Because of the current lack of diversity in engineering, support often focuses on marginalized groups, such as Black and Latinx students. However, student outcomes and previous research reveals the need for more responsive student support tailored to individual students? needs. Accordingly, the aim of this CAREER project is to advance the extent to which the engineering education community understands how marginalized students 1) navigate undergraduate engineering programs, and 2) make decisions with respect to seeking help. The study will provide information directly to student support services. By understanding the experiences and decision-making of Black and Latinx students, colleges and universities can support educational environments that are more responsive to the potential diversity of the student populations.

Primary data sources include institutional documents (e.g., program descriptions) from academic units and interviews with marginalized students. Data analysis is informed by person-environment fit theory. This project will introduce person-environment fit theory to scholars and practitioners who focus on marginalized students in engineering, and significantly advance fundamental knowledge of the strengths and deficiencies within university support structures and processes.

This CAREER project is motivated by the need for developing a methodology to expose and exploit synergy in the multiple steps of a complex chemical process. The ultimate purpose is to design intensified chemical processes that combine tasks into fewer units, resulting in higher product yields, higher energy efficiency and lest waste. This new methodology will be applied to design intensified processes for unconventional methane-to-chemicals conversions in remote locations for the production of high-value liquid chemicals using local sources of shale gas, biogas, or landfill gas. The research results will be integrated into educational and outreach activities, including a citizen science project focusing on intensification of shale gas activities in Texas and recruiting of underrepresented minorities into STEM careers through K-12 demonstrations of process design concepts.<br/><br/>The proposed research will employ theoretical analysis and computer simulations to systematically locate intensification hotspots in complex chemical processes and re-orient the underlying physical and chemical phenomena while striking a balance between modularity and intensification within the overall design. Systematic methods and algorithms will be formulated for synergistic design and operation of intensified systems that are amenable to both centralized and distributed chemical manufacturing. Identification of hidden synergies will transform many chemical processes, especially where intensification is not obvious or deemed to be disadvantageous.  Scaling down/out conventional processes without intensification could lead to poor economies-of-scale and high capital intensity. To this end, synergistic analysis provides a natural framework for studying the level of intensification of process designs. A graph theoretical representation of chemical processes is proposed based on phenomena-phenomena interactions (PPI) as new way to design processes with greater synergy. The PPI-based analysis can lead to innovative pathways and drastic improvements in energy, cost, emissions and waste to achieve sustainability in a resource-constrained environment. The change from the classic unit-operation-based representation into an interaction-based building block representation of chemical processes sets will enable design and intensification of complex processes without prior postulation of all plausible flowsheets. The generic block superstructure will essentially eliminate the need for problem specific designs and allow process synthesis, integration, and intensification in a single framework. The integration of research and education involves an assessment of chemical engineering curricula using a course-course interaction (CCI) graph to enhance synergistic learning and development of a new graduate course. The proposed project also includes a citizen science project to engage volunteers with diverse backgrounds in the intensification of a statewide Material and Process (MaP) network for shale gas utilization in Texas. The MaP project will provide an informal science education opportunity with a synergistic impact on participant knowledge. Women and minority students will be recruited through the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program and a building-block-based design concept will be included in projects designed for grades 1 to 4 to attract students into STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several catalogs have emerged from academia and industry documenting good and poor practices to make software more flexible, modular, reusable, and understandable. However, those practices are based on experts' opinions, i.e., researchers and software engineers, and not on empirical evidence. Thus, very little is known about the effect of those practices on developers when they read and understand software. With the recent adoption of high-resolution medical imaging technologies in software engineering, the investigator proposes to bring the science behind ""best and worst practices"" by empirically validating the impact of existing software practices on program comprehension. Moreover, the investigator will identify new practices using scientific methods as opposed to experts' opinions. The proposed work is expected to facilitate new research in the field of software engineering and beyond as it provides a general methodology to objectively measure program comprehension and to empirically evaluate and identify existing and new practices. The outcomes of this research will result in guidelines for students and software engineers on how to write software that minimizes their effort during program comprehension. Once the results have been disseminated and adopted by software engineers, they will be more productive, thus improving their well-being at the workplace. With support from this award, the investigator will integrate the results from this research in her undergraduate and graduate courses where she would teach student how to write software that is easier to understand.<br/><br/>The objective of this award is to bring science behind ""best"" and ""worst"" software practices by 1) using direct and objective measures to empirically evaluate the impact of existing practices on developers' cognitive load and 2) using those direct and objective measures to empirically identify new practices. In particular, the award targets good and poor software practices (i.e., patterns and antipatterns, respectively) pertaining to the design, code, and reviews of software in the context of bug localization and code review tasks. The central hypothesis is that software development practices impact the cognitive load that developers experience while understanding source code. To test the central hypothesis, mainly a series of controlled experiments will be conducted using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an eyetracking devices. Once the impact of software development practices on program comprehension has been determined, the investigator will recommend guidelines for how to develop and maintain software in a way that 1) it will require less mental effort to be understood by the original developers and by software maintainers; and 2) it will be easier to maintain.

Unsaturated soil mechanics plays a vital role in geohazard assessment, as well as energy, environmental, and coastal geotechnics. Advances in these fields are hindered by unsaturated soil failure mechanisms that are poorly characterized and thus difficult to predict and mitigate. Such failures involve coupled multiphysics processes and arbitrary shear bands/cracks at multiple space and time scales. With recent advances in high-performance computing (HPC), computational modeling is becoming increasingly crucial for advancing our ability to characterize, predict, and mitigate such failures. This powerful tool must be coupled with new and robust numerical methods that are designed to harness and optimize this capability. This CAREER project will develop a novel non-local mathematical and computational paradigm for modeling failure phenomena in non-isothermal unsaturated soils through HPC. The hypothesis is that material heterogeneities and environmental loads are the critical triggers for failures (shear bands/cracks) in unsaturated soils, and that the prediction of such failures can be achieved via coupling HPC with new physics-based numerical tools. The rigorous integration of unsaturated soil mechanics, interface physics, poromechanics, thermodynamics, non-local vector calculus, and HPC can potentially revolutionize our modeling techniques for multiscale, multiphysics problems. Integrated research and educational activities through HPC will foster the interest of high-school and underrepresented students in STEM educations and careers and engage graduate students in globally collaborative research and effective dissemination of scientific knowledge to a diverse audience. The cultivated diverse collaboration network, including NSF Centers, U.S. national laboratories, leading consulting firms, and top global institutions, will increase the national and global impacts of this project and has the added benefit of exposing students to a dynamic team.<br/><br/>The research goal of this CAREER grant is to better characterize and predict failures in unsaturated soils under environmental loads. This project will (i) formulate, implement, and validate a novel multiphysics peri-poromechanics (PPM) paradigm using non-local vector calculus and basic principles of physics and mechanics, and (ii) conduct extensive computational experiments through HPC. The new knowledge generated by this project includes a fundamental mechanistic understanding of multiphysics conditions driving failures of unsaturated soils that is crucial for building sustainable and resilient civil infrastructure. A significant outcome of this project is expected to be a novel multiphysics PPM paradigm that can potentially transform mathematical and computational modeling of failures in unsaturated soils due to its physical and mathematical consistency across multiple spatial scales. Original contributions expected are: (i) A novel physically, mathematically and computationally consistent paradigm for better modeling soil multiphysics; (ii) Next-generation non-local constitutive models for unsaturated soils; (iii) A validated open-source HPC tool for predicting unsaturated soil failures; and (iv) A new mechanistic understanding of multiphysics conditions driving failures in unsaturated soils. The educational plan will challenge and prepare next-generation engineers and scientists with a diverse knowledge base by integrating fundamental principles of mathematics, physics, mechanics, and HPC. This project will implement a series of initiatives, including two course modules on key concepts in unsaturated soil failure analysis and the vital role of HPC in basic scientific research, a cloud computing app, a dedicated wiki page, and NSF SimCenter and ASCE webinars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on complex concentrated alloys (CCAs), a class of novel alloys that mix atoms of different species at nearly equal ratios. The scientific drive for studying CCAs is to understand and utilize the vast chemical and structural design space associated with multiple elements in search of new materials properties. Current understanding about the stability, structures, and properties of alloys is limited to the corners and edges of the multi-element space, such as binary or dilute alloys. The information for CCAs close to the center of the composition space is virtually non-existent for systems with four or more elements. The project intends to fill this knowledge gap in alloy theory for these complex alloy systems by (i) establishing an accurate predictive understanding of the atomic structures in CCAs through a combination of quantum mechanical calculations and statistical mechanics methods, and (ii) integrating quantum mechanical calculations, empirical models and close-loop machine learning methods to predict the structural and defect features in CCAs for accelerated design of CCAs for structural or functional applications.  The multidisciplinary nature of the project brings perspectives from multiple academic fields into the forefront of materials research. The focus of the technologically relevant CCAs will strengthen the U.S. leadership in fundamental alloy research. <br/><br/>The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development.

Severe lattice distortion is an important phenomenon that is correlated to a variety of physical and chemical properties in CCAs. However, the nature of severe lattice distortions in CCAs is poorly understood, especially with the coupling of SRO. The PI will study SRO and related lattice distortions in CCAs with a unique synergy of mechanism investigation, predictive modeling, and methodology development. The research will elucidate SRO on the structures of lattice distortions in CCAs, which will be utilized to quantify the impact of the distorted lattices on the phonon characteristics of CCAs. Results and methodology from bulk CCAs will be applied to establish a predictive mapping linking defect characteristics with local environments in CCAs, providing the foundation for computational design of CCAs for superior mechanical properties. The project will be driven by the parallel research on a hierarchical data-driven computational framework that enables efficient predictions of structure-property relationships for CCAs. <br/><br/>The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development.

In single-user AR, a user's perception is augmented by overlaying virtual objects onto the real world. In multi-user AR, multiple users are able to view and interact with a common set of virtual objects. However, in today's multi-user AR applications, users can experience poor performance (such as high latency or inconsistent views of the virtual objects by different users) due to the AR application's lack of advanced networking capabilities. This project seeks to address such user experience issues by developing the network capabilities of the underlying AR platform, in order to support future multi-user AR applications.<br/><br/>The vision of this project is to create AR-enabling technology where multiple users can visually scan the environment, and a common set of relevant virtual objects swiftly pop up on top of the real-world objects. To accomplish this, the AR devices need to efficiently compute and exchange information amongst themselves, in order to synchronize their joint understanding of the real and virtual worlds. The planned research has three main technical components: (1) measuring and characterizing multi-user AR applications; (2) adapting an AR application to the computing and networking conditions; and (3) adapting the network to the needs of an AR application. Evaluation scenarios include an educational AR classroom application, as well as mobile clients in a 5G testbed.<br/><br/>The success of this project will open up a new class of multi-user AR applications in a broad range of fields, including education (for example, multiple AR-equipped students in a classroom) and public safety (for example, multiple AR-equipped first responders in a disaster scenario). The findings from this project will impact how application developers design AR applications and how network operators manage AR network traffic. The multi-user AR platform will be incorporated into undergraduate classes and a campus makerspace, as well as in outreach efforts at local hackathons and high school workshops, with the aim of encouraging women to enter and stay in engineering fields.<br/><br/>Results from this project, including papers, simulation and application code, and AR quality evaluation and benchmarking tools, will be available at the project website https://github.com/multi-user-ar. The website and code will be available and supported for the duration of this project, and preserved online thereafter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interaction can be external, such as waiting on a user input or a network package, or internal, where the components that make up the application interact with one another, often asynchronously. It is important that interactive applications run fast on commodity multicore hardware, because fast interactions lead to good user experiences, and multicore processors are the bargain components of today's hardware technology.  Fast interactive parallel applications can be challenging to develop, however, as the programmer must deal with multiple non-trivial concerns simultaneously, including asynchrony, concurrency, and ensuring application responsiveness.<br/><br/>This project focuses on developing software infrastructure to enable non-expert programmers to write parallel interactive applications that run fast on multicore hardware.  The resulting platform provides: (1) a high-level language abstraction that decouple parallelism and concurrency specifications from scheduling and encapsulate nondeterminism; (2) a provably and practically efficient scheduler that achieve various desirable performance criteria; (3) a well-defined cost model to reason about the performance of the computation; and (4) a set of efficient tools to debug code written using the abstraction. The resulting platform enables programmer productivity in developing parallel interactive applications and efficient utilization of multicore hardware.

The project provides an unprecedented, quantitative look into the role of microbial biofilms in structuring larval settlement at hydrothermal vents, achieved only through the close collaboration of microbial and larval ecologists. The combined field program of short-term settlement experiments, microbial ""-omics"" work, and subsequent shipboard settlement experiments allows the investigative team to use field experiments to statistically model the factors that best predict larval settlement in the field, then test those predictions with shipboard experiments that decouple covarying conditions. This extensive characterization of putative larval settlement cues and their relationship to colonization success in heterogeneous vent habitat niches will contribute to a broader understanding of colonization success across diverse marine ecosystems. Understanding the role that the initial settlement of larvae plays in the recovery and resilience of hydrothermal-vent ecosystems is critical to developing informed management plans for deep-sea mining.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The complex tissue system studied here, the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), functions autonomously within the walls of the gut, regulating intestinal movements and homeostatic functions. While it is generally understood how the ENS functions, currently very little is known about the processes ENS progenitor cells use to self-assemble into nervous tissue and form circuits during embryological development. Greater knowledge about how the ENS is generated will facilitate advances in tissue engineering strategies, as well as helping us to better understand how cells get sculpted into specialized tissues. The research addresses two fundamental issues: 1) the cellular behaviors that orchestrate the very first steps in vertebrate ENS formation, and 2) the genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie these initial steps of ENS construction. Experiments capitalize on the ease of manipulation and optical transparency of zebrafish embryos to quantitatively and mechanistically analyze ENS formation starting from its earliest progenitor cell populations. In addition to supporting graduate student training in quantitative biology and neuroscience, this award will support both the academic-year and summer training of economically-disadvantaged undergraduate students, concomitant with the arrival of the first class of undergraduate students admitted to attend Rice University tuition-free. Additionally, a novel course module will be implemented for students to learn effective scientific communication via the development of critical writing and visual/oral presentation skills; and hands-on zebrafish experimental workshops for local community-college students will be developed and delivered in an outreach capacity.<br/><br/>How and when neural progenitor cells transform into vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) neurons has been difficult to study in vivo in mammals, due to the relative inaccessibility of in-utero embryos at the necessary stages of development, and the internal position of the gut within those embryos. The research uses optically-clear, externally-developing zebrafish embryos to overcome these barriers, and identify how enteric neural progenitor cells (ENPs) migrate and embed within their native gut microenvironment. ENP cells can be directly tracking and experimentally manipulated to a degree that is infeasible in other systems. Experiments will quantitatively and functionally analyze ENP cell transformations into ENS using cutting-edge single-cell genomics, high-resolution time-lapse confocal microscopy, computational analyses and quantitative dissection of cellular behaviors over the full course of ENS development. The results from these studies will be used to create mechanistic models to describe the molecular and cellular emergence of ENS from ENPs along the gut microenvironment. Taken together, these results will provide a novel mechanistic framework for understanding how ENS emergence gets orchestrated, and will help transform our scientific understanding of how progenitor cells are sculpted to form specialized cell networks and tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Towards the challenge of scale, TyDriS contributes new search algorithms that allow synthesis to leverage large code libraries and integrate synthesized code with programmer-written code.

However, they are complicated and prone to bugs due to their combinatorially large state-spaces, and node and network failures. Recent occurrences of data, currency and service loss have shown that reliability of distributed systems remains elusive. The inherent complication is faced by not only protocol and system designers that provide interfaces but even distributed application programmers that use these interfaces. This project addresses programmer productivity and reliability of distributed systems that spans both the client applications and the supporting distributed middleware. <br/><br/>This project includes both novel automatic synthesis techniques for client applications and novel verification techniques for distributed middleware. Distributed stores provide a spectrum of consistency choices that impose a dilemma for clients between correctness, responsiveness and availability. Given the high-level integrity properties of the application, this project automatically decides the minimum required coordination that guarantees integrity and convergence and automatically synthesizes protocols for replicated objects. The reliability of these applications is crucially dependent on the correctness of the underlying middleware of subtle protocols such as broadcast and consensus. The middleware is classically designed as stacks of layers, and its correctness is often stated compositionally as intuitive arguments on temporal precedence of the events exchanged between each layer and its sub-layers. This project builds a development and verification framework in a proof assistant to design a mechanically verified middleware stack. The framework is based on a compositional and temporal program logic so that the proofs match the intuitive arguments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Focus will be on trace metals and organic peroxides, latter of which represent a new class of molecules to be studied in this context. Results from ambient aerosol analyses, laboratory simulations and chamber experiments will inform parametrization of OH production for incorporation into larger scale climate models.<br/> <br/>The project aims at increasing understanding of mechanisms of atmospheric production of OH in cloud droplets. The work is motivated by the PI?s observation of an initial and substantial burst in OH production when exposing aerosols to near-UV radiation. Identifying new OH sources in cloud droplets has important and potentially transformative implications on many chemical and physical atmospheric processes that affect global climate and human health. The three-pronged experimental approach consists of measuring OH production in (i) collected and chemically analyzed ambient aerosols of various types; (ii) controlled laboratory experiments using a series of synthesized (hydro)peroxides, trace metals, and varying pH, conductivity, and wavelength; and (iii) chamber generated aerosol particles. A new semi-portable instrument (direct-to liquid OH analyzer) is sought to be developed that allows aerosols to grow to droplets that are collected and analyzed for OH formation on the time scale of tens of minutes to hours. Chemical kinetic modeling of results from all components of the experimental approach will be used to derive rate constants and parametrization for implementation in larger scale models.

Despite achieving high performance and unprecedented classification accuracies on a variety of perception tasks, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be adversarially vulnerable. For example, a DNN can be easily fooled into mis-classifying an input with slight changes of image-pixel intensities. This vulnerability severely limits the deployment and its use in safety-critical real-world tasks such as self-driving cars, malware detection, healthcare monitoring systems etc. This project investigates hardware aware techniques to resolve or resist software vulnerabilities (specifically, adversarial attacks) by exploring the design space of energy-accuracy-robustness trade-off cohesively with algorithm-hardware co-design to create functional intelligent systems. Thus, the project seeks to develop robustness-aware algorithms broadly applicable to the energy-efficient and secure implementation of DNN engines on both current CMOS accelerator platforms and emerging memory technologies. Furthermore, the research will support the interdisciplinary development of a diverse cohort of PhD and undergraduate students, and the development of a graduate-level course at Yale University on neural network architectures and learning algorithms tied with robustness from circuit and system design perspective.<br/><br/>The technical aims of this project are divided into two thrusts. The first thrust develops robustness centred algorithms in DNNs where techniques such as quantization, pruning among others are used to improve the adversarial resilience of models while yielding energy-efficiency benefits. This part also identifies a new form of noise stability for DNNs, i.e., the sensitivity of each layer?s computation to adversarial noise. This allows for a principled way of applying layer-specific algorithmic modifications that incurs adversarial robustness as well as energy-efficiency with minimal loss in accuracy. The second thrust benchmarks and implements the proposed robust computing models on emerging technology-based memristor crossbar-array platforms to investigate the hardware-level benefits (while comparing with standard CMOS accelerator baselines). In particular, design issues and complexities for implementing variable precision, stochastic and combined stochastic-deterministic neuronal activity will be investigated. The two thrusts offer a fundamental co-design infrastructure where algorithmic innovations will be used to optimize robust and efficient hardware implementations for neural networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, new materials with specific properties are needed to better facilitate splitting of water into its basic components, which is important for the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from renewable sources. A similarly important property is the conduction of charges in certain solid materials, a phenomenon that is essential to many energy devices such as batteries and fuel cells. Studying fundamental aspects of these properties is at the center of this CAREER award. The award is jointly supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry. Under this award the research group of Prof. Ramezanipour develops guidelines for rational design of functional materials, where important energy-related properties are controlled and modified by changing the arrangements of atoms within the compounds. This project advances fundamental understanding of functional materials and results in discovery of novel compounds that contribute to the progress of science and technology in the field of energy-related applications. In addition, as part of this award an educational plan helps students to enhance their laboratory skills, facilitates their academic success, and prepares them for potential careers in areas that require expertise in a laboratory setting. Furthermore, outreach activities for underrepresented minority students introduce these students to basic research, increase the scientific literacy, and spark interest in chemistry. These outreach activities, and an internship program for female students to participate in hands-on research, broaden the impact of the project and help increase diversity in STEM fields.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>With this CAREER award, jointly supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, researchers work to uncover the fundamental parameters that allow for rational design and synthesis of defect-ordered architectures and the impact of defect-arrangement on functional properties, in particular the charge-transport and oxygen-evolution activity. The specific focus is on design and synthesis of defect-ordered oxygen-deficient perovskites, which have recently shown outstanding electrocatalytic activity for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) of water splitting. Until now the fundamental structure-property relationships that control their OER activity have remained largely unexplored. The key characteristic of this class of materials is the presence of defects, created due to oxygen-deficiency. Various arrangements of defects lead to different types of ordered structures. Here Prof. Ramezanipour and his group investigate how the arrangement and ordering of defects can be controlled and explore the role of defect-arrangement in directing the OER activity of oxygen-deficient perovskites. In addition, they investigate the relationship between defect-arrangement and charge-transport, which is another property that affects the OER activity. Overall, the multifaceted and comprehensive approach involves material design, synthesis and study of the changes in structural order, valence-state, electronic structure, charge-transport, and the impact these parameters have on OER properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today's standard technologies rely on electromagnetic wave for communication around the human body, which is not physically secure and consume orders of magnitude more power than needed by a typical sensor node, making the communication link the energy bottleneck for ultra-low-power body sensor nodes.  This research project will lead to a fundamentally new way of thinking about using human body as a ""wire"" to achieve orders of magnitude lower energy used for communication around the human body while being physically secure (i.e., signals cannot be snooped without physical contact). In addition, this project will use edge-analytics to reduce data volume for efficient Human-Intranet smart sensor nodes. The project will develop the fundamental understanding for designing the smallest (less than one cubic millimeter) body-connected node for connected healthcare.  With simulation tools and hardware verification, backed by concrete mathematical model development, this work will open new research directions in Human-Intranet for Healthcare, Human-Computer Interaction and Brain-Machine Interfaces.

The strong engagement through undergraduate research mentorship and minority student mentorship will strengthen the interest of science and technology from underrepresented students.  <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to transform data communication around the human body by using the human body as a wire to achieve orders of magnitude reduction in communication energy in the body area network and combining it with in-sensor analytics to reduce data volume without significant reduction in information to further improve energy/information efficiency. The project will develop the foundations of energy-efficient and physically secured network of energy-sparse sensor nodes for Human-Intranet. The research exploits the low-loss human body channel itself to power the sensor, perform edge-analytics to compress the data and extract information before transferring the compressed data using the same low-loss human body channel. The body-wire research is expected to solve the problem of high data traffic by achieving >1000x reduction in energy/information, allowing longer-lasting, smarter, smaller (new form-factors, better patient compliance), and lower cost healthcare. The energy reduction and improved physical security (in addition to encryption) will open possibilities of many new sensor nodes with new form factors (e.g., connected patch) for human-centered healthcare networks. Along with developing bio-physical circuit models for human body as a communication medium, optimized transceiver circuits and systems for lossy broadband electro-quasistatic human body channel will be developed and demonstrated through integrated circuit fabrication and measurement. A system-on-chip with sensing, in-sensor analytics, and human-body-communication transceiver will be designed, fabricated, and measured to demonstrate the end-to-end improvement in energy/information efficiency. The project will develop mathematical models verified by experiments for future design space exploration and information/energy analysis for Human-Intranet. If successful, the project will develop the fundamental understanding of designing the smallest body-connected node for connected healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particularly common mechanism that instructs cells what type to become involves communication via proteins on their surface. The Zeller laboratory studies this process in a simple animal model called an ascidian that allows them to observe individual cells and manipulate the functions of their proteins. This project will utilize an approach called optogenetics, in which a specific color of light manipulates the function of these cell surface proteins to alter how cells communicate with one another. By illuminating the ascidian embryo at different times, they can manipulate the process of cell communication precisely to learn how this mechanism operates. This will be one of the first applications of optogenetics in ascidians and they will provide the broader scientific community with the set of tools that they develop. In addition, they will develop learning modules for both undergraduate and graduate-level courses to provide students with an opportunity to use optogenetics. Lastly, they will share this work with the public by developing an activity that demonstrates the principles of optogenetics to children that will be incorporated into our lab?s annual open house presentation at the San Diego State University Marine Laboratory.<br/><br/>The ascidian larval peripheral nervous system (PNS) is composed of a series of ciliated sensory neurons that are patterned, in part, by Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. The sensory neurons express two Notch ligands, Delta and Jagged, at different times and in different spatial domains suggesting that more complex Notch signaling, including lateral induction, may play a role in spatial patterning. To investigate this, the Zeller laboratory will utilize an ontogenetically-regulated transcription factor, coupled with tissue-specifically expressed CRISPR reagents to manipulate Notch ligand function with precise spatiotemporal control. By manipulating the function of both Notch ligands individually and simultaneously at different times during PNS development they will tease apart patterning contributions from lateral inhibition and induction. This will be one of the first uses of optogenetics in ascidians and they will provide reagents to the broader scientific community. Using optogenetics-based approaches in other experimental systems will provide a level of precise spatiotemporal regulation that is currently difficult to achieve. They will develop an optogenetics module that will be introduced into one or more advanced undergraduate laboratory courses at San Diego State University and introduce graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to optogenetics by developing a laboratory module in the ascidian section of the Embryology Course at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole. Finally, to expose the general public to optogenetics, they will develop an interactive presentation for children that will explain optogenetics principles that will be incorporated into our lab?s annual open house presentation at the SDSU Marine Laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, B cells are not on alert all the time; they need to be selectively activated to proliferate and change (differentiate) to become antibody-producing cells in a special physiological microenvironment called the germinal center (GC). Due to its complicated structure, function, and dynamically evolving nature, creating a fully functional GC model ex vivo (outside the body) is extremely challenging, and thus requires an interdisciplinary and comprehensive engineering approach. This CAREER project seeks to develop a purely artificial GC model system by recreating the most critical components of the GC capable of inducing a full array of B cell reactions. Using the ex-vivo model system with precise and independent control over each critical parameter, the roles of these GC components in producing B cell reactions will be investigated in unprecedented detail compared to using conventional in-vivo (inside the body) observations. These outcomes will enable critical advancement of various fields, including vaccination, immunotherapy, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. As complementary educational and outreach plans of the highly interdisciplinary project, focus has been made on three aspects: 1) the development of effective curricula for immunoengineering that teaches the topics at the interface between immunology and engineering, 2) the creation of uniquely collaborative environment for education and research among academia, local research institutes, and industry partners, and 3) the promotion of underrepresented high school and college students in Northern Alabama to be engaged in immunoengineering and general STEM fields.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to develop translational cellular and molecular immunotherapies for cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases through the unconventional amalgamation of biomaterials engineering and immunology, namely immunoengineering. Towards this goal, this CAREER project will develop an artificial ex-vivo model system that enables the mimicry of the most important functional feature of the geminal center (GC):  to create B cells that can produce affinity-matured antigen-specific antibodies.  Despite tremendous achievements in B-cell biology and immunology, no artificial model system has yet been fully capable of recapitulating all the critical features of the GCs ex vivo. Motivated by findings from state-of-the-art GC models, this project hypothesizes that there are three critical components of the GC microenvironments, without the correct mimicry of which, the recapitulation of ex-vivo GC reactions would be impossible: 1) the optimal CD40L-CD40 signaling that requires help signals from T-follicular helper (TFH) cells, 2) the zonal structure of the GC and interzonal migration between the light zone (LZ) and the dark (DZ) of the GC B cells, and 3) the temporally controlled on-and-off B cell receptor (BCR) signals that require antigen presentations from follicular dendric cells (FDCs).  The Research Plan is organized under three objectives that address each of the identified critical components.  Each objective includes development of systematically controllable biomaterial platforms that will provide critical biological signals and microenvironments to artificially developing GC B cells.  The FIRST Objective is to control the quality and quantity of the CD40 signaling provided by follicular helper T (TFH) cells, by providing CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154) molecules on bio-mimetic/bio-responsive viscoelastic hydrogels that have tunable modulus and stress relaxation characteristics.  The expected outcome is enhanced understanding of how to control the quantity and quality of signaling events by designing mechanical properties of biomaterials platforms for the presentation of ligands to cell-surface receptors, especially to various molecules of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily to which CD40L belongs.  The SECOND Objective is to provide a microenvironment mimicking the zonal structures of GC (DZ and LZ) by creating controlled chemokine gradients within a microfluidic device for the artificial GC B Cells. By providing a controlled chemokine gradient using microfluidic devices, a systematic study about the conditions that enable artificially activated B cells to migrate and the consequences of the interzonal migrations in terms of GC reactions will be enabled.  The THIRD Objective is to introduce On and Off temporal regulation of BCR signaling via reversible surface conjugation of model antigens to microbead-based artificial FDCs, hypothesizing that the BCR signaling needs to be temporally regulated on-and-off in order to enable an extended proliferation of GC B cells  The expected outcome is a clearer understanding of the role of BCR signaling in GC reactions.  Finally, the outcomes of this project are expected to enable realization of a functional artificial ex-vivo GC model that could: 1) facilitate the development of novel vaccines against major pathogens for which no effective vaccines are yet available by enabling recognition of novel B-cell epitopes without T-cell dependency, 2) be developed as a linearly scalable cell-manufacturing platform for generation of antigen-specific effector B cells as adoptive cell therapy, and 3) serve as a better-controlled and more cost-effective model system in biomedical sciences that studies B-cell biology and B-cell malignancies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many coastal communities, they are a source of income, a shield against storm damage, and a cultural icon. For more than 240 million years, the growth of stony corals engineered these ecosystems. Over that time, stony corals split into two main groups with more than 1500 species. But corals are not alone; the use of molecular tools identified symbiosis on microscopic scale. Inside each coral polyp are communities of dinoflagellates, bacteria, and archaea that are together called the coral microbiome. Coral microbiomes can help or harm stressed corals. This can affect reef decline due to coral disease and mass coral bleaching. It is thought that coral species with more innate immunity genes have less diverse microbiomes. However, this has not yet been tested. This project will test this idea using a cost-effective ?genome skimming? approach to compare coral microbes and immunity genes across 128 coral species. This comparison will suggest how different innate immunity genes shape coral microbiomes. The project will use Karenina, a new statistical method, to test ideas about how immunity changes microbiome dynamics during stress.  Finally, the project will test those predictions in laboratory experiments. These research aims are paired with an education plan that will use project data in undergraduate classes, develop a new online interactive bioinformatics textbook, and produce Reef Scenarios, a learning product that will let high school and undergraduate students simulate reef ecology in engaging classroom exercises.<br/><br/>The ability of scleractinian (?stony?) corals to survive many ecological stressors ? from macroalgal competition to bleaching ? is thought to depend on the outcome of coral x microbe x environment interactions. Therefore, understanding how corals regulate their microbiome is important for understanding coral?s response to environmental stress. Coral innate immunity is thought to play a critical role in regulating the microbiome. Yet the relationship between coral innate immunity and microbiome richness, composition, and stability is not yet well understood. This project implements an integrated research and education plan to study how the evolution of cnidarian innate immunity has influenced microbiome structure, and how changes in the bacterial and archaeal portion of the microbiome may influence survival of thermal stress. This approach will combine a global cross-species survey relating innate immune gene repertoires in diverse coral genomes with their microbiome richness and composition and laboratory experiments in a model cnidarian that can confirm or falsify proposed immunity-microbiome interactions from the survey. A new modeling approach will be used to carefully distinguish competing time-series models of the effects of innate immunity and thermal stress on microbiome dynamics. By uniting sequencing approaches with a tractable cnidarian model system, this project will test key hypotheses in cnidarian host-microbe symbiosis, ecology and evolution.  These research objectives are integrated with an education and outreach plan that includes use of project data in undergraduate classes, development of a new interactive online bioinformatics text, and production of Reef Scenarios, a classroom product for simulating reef ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Environmental conditions vary at small spatial scales (for example, moving between sunny and shady patches), which can present challenges to organisms that are adapted to specific conditions. Plants and animals have strategies that allow them to cope with this variation, and it is important for scientists to understand how such strategies are deployed so responses to environmental changes can be better predicted. The goals of this project are to 1) quantify the strength of natural selection acting on the way embryos develop in response to environmental variation, 2) determine if newly-hatched offspring seek suitable habitat, and 3) examine whether mothers select nest sites with conditions that have life-long benefits for their offspring. Understanding these three different ways of dealing with environmental variation will help ecologists predict how animals will respond to environmental change. This project also aims to improve science education in Alabama by creating a summer fellowship program for middle school teachers. Teachers will conduct research and develop lesson plans for their classrooms to better prepare them to teach science as a process. Teacher fellows will also mentor middle school students in science fair projects, which in turn, will enhance science literacy in schools that are under-served in science education.<br/><br/>Natural selection has favored several routes that enable organisms to overcome challenges imposed by heterogeneous environments. First, plastic responses to the environment can modify phenotypes so that they are suited to the surrounding environment (Environmental Matching Hypothesis). Second, rather than the environment shaping an individual?s phenotype, individuals can actively seek environments that are suited to their phenotype (Matching Habitat Choice Hypothesis). Third, parents can select specific microhabitats that shield their developing offspring from environmental variation, thereby exposing them to ?good? developmental environments that have life-long positive effects (Silver Spoon Hypothesis). These strategies can maximize fitness in heterogeneous environments at different life stages (via embryo responses, post-natal habitat choice, or parental behavior). However, despite many empirical studies of each hypothesis, most do not simultaneously consider these explanations as alternate or interactive routes that influence the evolution of developmental plasticity. The goals of this project are to (1) test these alternative hypotheses for how organisms deal with environmental heterogeneity, and (2) empirically quantify selection on developmental reaction norms in wild populations and identify behaviors that facilitate or limit the evolution of plasticity. This research will integrate laboratory and field studies of brown anole lizards that inhabit islands that vary in habitat structure and ambient conditions. The integration of novel lab and field approaches will set new standards for empirical studies of selection on plasticity, and the consequences of matching habitat choice and maternal nesting behaviors in the wild. Overall, this work will provide an integrative assessment of how organisms deal with environmental heterogeneity in nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stable gene silencing can distinguish single-celled organisms and it also helps the human body use the same genome to create very different cell types that form organs.  One major determinant of stable gene silencing is how far along a chromosome the wave of silencing spreads.  Understanding how spreading occurs and how it is stopped are the primary focuses of this project.  Achieving the goals of this project will help us understand variation across genetically identical cells that underlies development and environmental effects on gene regulation.   The project will be undertaken by a team of scientists lead by the PI and including postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates.  Summer research experiences for high school students and their teachers from a local school with a high minority population will enhance the training impact of the project.  Together, the team will contribute to the research, combining their resources and skill sets while mentoring each other across levels.  The results from this project will be broadly shared with the research community and the public and the resources generated will be made available to the scientific field.<br/><br/>Heterochromatin is a genomic structure that represses transcription in a manner that is epigenetically maintained through cell division, contributing to stable cell differentiation in all eukaryotes.  Establishment of a heterochromatin domain involves site-specific initiation and subsequent spreading across large regions of the genome, incorporating repressor proteins that stably associate with chromatin.  Spreading is coupled to the conversion of histone modifications at the ?leading edge? and eventual transition to the stable heterochromatin state.  This mechanism requires two main modes of action for the heterochromatin machinery: dynamic spreading and stable repressive association with chromatin.  While much is known of the components of heterochromatin in multiple systems, we do not understand at molecular resolution how the machinery coordinates the transitions through the steps of the mechanism.  This project harnesses a purified budding yeast heterochromatin system that fully recapitulates the dynamic conversion of histone modifications and the formation of a stable repressive heterochromatin state.  Previous work from the research group using this system has generated models for many steps in the mechanism that will now be tested at a new level of molecular resolution.  Advanced cross-linking mass spectrometry will be used, combined with ?designer? chromatin to capture the heterochromatin machinery in the multiple modes of action that drive formation of an epigenetic repressive genomic structure.  The wealth of genetic and biochemical tools available will allow for identification of the most important molecular interactions for heterochromatin assembly, generating a new level of mechanistic understanding of this fundamental genomic regulatory system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such ability is constrained by our limited understanding of the complexity of microbial communities below ground and their connections to plants, and overall ecosystem function. Research in this NSF CAREER grant will investigate the interaction between plant diversity and soil microbial communities and the processes that they carry out.  These include plant matter decomposition, nutrient regeneration, carbon retention and contributions to atmospheric gases. The synergistic nature of research and educational components of this project will produce well-trained personnel who will work effectively to address the Nation's agricultural and environmental challenges and opportunities.

These effects occur because the experience of winning and losing have different effects on the brain. What these discoveries do not explain, is how individuals can transition from losing to winning. This is especially true during adolescence, when individuals have less competitive experience and are more likely to lose. A specific type of behavioral strategy, social vigilance, may be a key mechanism for facilitating this transition. Social vigilance involves a combination of avoidance and observation of potentially threatening individuals. In this project, the research team will test whether increased testosterone secretion during adolescence facilitates a transition from social vigilance to more assertive aggressive behaviors in males. In adults, short term increases in testosterone after winning play a key role in facilitating winner effects. The researchers predict that the testosterone secretion during adolescence desensitizes neural circuits that promote social vigilance. To address this question this project will determine whether testosterone acts during puberty to alter the activity of neurons within neural circuits that control social vigilance as well as defensive and offensive vocalizations used in aggressive encounters. The University of California at Davis is a Hispanic Serving Institution with a strong track record of supporting an inclusive STEM culture to broaden impact and increase discovery. Support of this research will provide training opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups in STEM and increase community engagement via open house events.<br/><br/>This project integrates behavioral, neuroendocrine, and physiological levels of analysis of social behavior. Previous work shows that oxytocin acting in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) increases social vigilance behavior, and that social stress increases the activity of oxytocin neurons. A key hypothesis is that the pubertal surge of testosterone reprograms oxytocin neurons in the BNST to be less sensitive to social stress. Social vigilance is oxytocin dependent, and more prevalent in juvenile males than adults. This research will first test whether increased testosterone during puberty reduces stress-induced vigilance in males and females. The effects of stress on long term potentiation (LTP) of oxytocin neurons will be examined and whether the effects of stress on LTP are modulated by pubertal testosterone exposure. In the rat hippocampus and the zebra finch song control system testosterone acts during puberty to reduce LTP. Finally, the effects of pubertal testosterone on territory formation will be studied by observing aggressive behaviors and the use of well characterized assertive and passive vocalizations during territory formation. Results from these studies will provide important insights into the neural circuits that facilitate social transitions that occurs across vertebrate species. This project will also generate new tools, including a brain atlas of the adolescent California mouse brain which will be hosted on brainmaps.org.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How can a computer be trained to transcribe music audio into music notation or compose a new song? Can a computer system teach a person to better use prosody ? the musical pattern of speech ? to become a more effective public speaker? These are some of the questions that students will investigate in this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Rochester. Students will explore an exciting, interdisciplinary research area that combines computer science, electrical engineering, cognitive science, and music. Each student will be mentored by two or more faculty members from the University's schools of engineering, sciences, arts, and music. Other activities of the REU site include workshops on career development; scholarship community colloquiums; graduate school preparation; Python programming for machine learning; and music-focused activities. The goals of this REU are to increase the diversity and broaden the horizons of students engaged in computer science research. The themes of music, digital media, and cognitive science will attract many students from groups under-represented in computer science. The site welcomes students from institutions where opportunities for interdisciplinary research combining computational methods, arts and humanities may be limited. Students who are already majoring in computer science will discover that the research in the field is not limited to traditional engineering applications, but can address questions of art, culture, and human psychology. Students with experience in combining computer science with humanistic research are already in great demand in industry and academia and will help define what it means to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.<br/> <br/>Students in this REU will engage in interdisciplinary research that combines machine learning, computer audition, music theory, and cognitive science. These disciplines are united by their use of a common set of formal representations and computational methods; in particular, probabilistic models and machine learning. In the research activities, REU students will work on a variety of topics. These include: creating human-computer collaborative music making systems; developing electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis methods to decode musical minds; using machine learning and multispectral imaging to read hidden text in ancient manuscripts; studying how prosody makes a person a convincing public speaker; developing big data techniques to analyze audio-visual scenes; and, exploring connections between human and computer natural language processing. The program is strengthened by the University's recently-founded audio and music engineering program, and the partnership with the Eastman School of Music. Although the major objective of the REU is to encourage students to enter STEM graduate programs, many of the projects can be  expected to lead to novel and publishable research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During meiosis, chromosomes with similar DNA sequence become physically joined and swap pieces of their DNA. This process is called recombination, and it produces new DNA combinations and can drive evolutionary change. Recombination also assures that the DNA is correctly partitioned into sperm and egg cells. Defects in recombination can result in sperm or eggs with too little or too much DNA. Such genetic errors can cause infertility, lead to miscarriage, and contribute to developmental disability in humans Both the frequency and the placement of recombination events along chromosomes are surprisingly variable between males and females, between individuals, and between species. This research program aims to identify the causes of natural variation in recombination. The discovered mechanisms of recombination variation may have general effects on fertility. Consequently, findings from this work could lead to the discovery of new targets for improving species of agricultural and economic importance as well as clinical tests for identifying patients with genetic mechanisms of infertility. This project will also benefit society by supporting a coordinated series of educational activities that will create new evolutionary genomics education and research opportunities in Maine. <br/><br/>This project will combine evolutionary quantitative genomic methods and cytogenetic approaches to dissect the root causes of recombination rate variation in male and female individuals, and at the population and subspecies levels. The planned research will take advantage of established tools and resources in house mice (Mus musculus) to map genes that contribute to variation in recombination at multiple levels. The proposed experiments will test new hypotheses about the evolutionary forces that shape variation in recombination and will explore the relationship between recombination and fertility. These research activities will provide a platform for postdoctoral training and will synergize with substantial teaching, mentoring, and outreach efforts. Specifically, the proposed project will (1) develop new course content and materials to advance the state of genomics education in Maine high schools; (2) create mentored research opportunities for undergraduate students; and (3) support the PI?s development of a new graduate-level course in evolutionary and population genomics. Overall, this career development program will prepare an early-stage female investigator to make substantial life-long contributions to science through original research, mentoring, and education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeologists have studied the Fremont for over a century; however, there is still considerable debate over who the Fremont were and where they came from. This project will address fundamental, big-picture questions about Fremont to help create a new foundational understanding about this group. Located at the northern fringes of the more densely populated North American Southwest, the Fremont region is ideally situated to explore how identity was negotiated and created in prehistoric frontier zones. The academic debate over who the Fremont were has also proved a stumbling block to educators teaching Utah state history. Little information on the Fremont has been published for a public audience. Ms. Richards will work with 4th grade teachers (the year when Utah state history is taught) to create lesson plans that will help educators more effectively teach about Utah?s priceless cultural heritage and prehistory. <br/><br/>Ms. Richards and Dr. Duff will use pottery to explore Fremont origins, social organization, and identity in this northern frontier of the North American Southwest. Frontier studies provide a dynamic and powerful way to explore how identity is formed, negotiated, and maintained in regions where disparate traditions meet, and will be used to explore the complex blend of innovation and tradition present in Fremont material culture. Using both high- and low- technology methods, the researchers will use a multi-scalar approach to better understand Fremont. At the broadest scale, the researchers will evaluate how Fremont fits into the larger history of the American Southwest. Using attributes of Fremont and Southwestern pottery, they will explore potential origins of the Fremont ceramic tradition and assess whether painted ceramic technology was brought into the region as a result of migration or was a locally produced emulation. They will then use instrumental neutron activation analysis to chemically characterize Fremont pottery and reconstruct Fremont production and exchange networks at a regional scale. At the finest scale, they will explore how painted ceramics were used within villages across the region.

Recent years have witnessed an explosion in research on building synthetic cells, not only as a way to study the origins and the rules of life, but also as a new approach to biochemical engineering to increase the yield in making molecules. Nevertheless, current synthetic cell research has neglected one of the most fundamental properties of living matter ? the ability to self-repair following damage. Living cells are generally soft and easily damaged, yet a number of them can repair themselves after being mechanically punctured, torn, or even ripped in half. If one could construct such self-repairing capability in synthetic cells, it should be possible to gain insights into one of the defining features of cells. At the same time, it could open new realms of biochemical engineering by allowing the synthetic cell systems to operate robustly under the potentially harsh environment of industrial processes. One approach to attaining self-repairing synthetic cells is to adapt self-repair mechanisms from a living system which already demonstrates robust capacity to heal from large mechanical wounds within a single cell, and build analogs of these mechanisms inside synthetic cells. One such system is Stentor coeruleus, a single-celled free-living ciliate, which possess a more robust wound healing capacity than most other cells. However, the self-repair mechanisms of Stentor are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal, therefore, is to understand the mechanisms by which Stentor cells can heal robustly from large mechanical wounds. The results of this work will lead to fundamental insights into wound healing, one of the defining features of life. It will also lay the foundation for constructing self-repairing synthetic cells. The collaboration between the researchers will provide a unique opportunity for training and workforce development at the interface of cell biology and engineering. A website on ?superhero cells and bugs? will be created to raise public interest in non-model organisms possessing ?superpowers? such as self-healing and survival in space. The researchers will continue their efforts to recruit underrepresented minorities to science and engineering via social media, outreach activities targeted to K-12 students, and their active participation in the Bay Area Science Festival and the Maker Faire.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to understand at a physical and molecular level how Stentor coeruleus cells can heal robustly from large mechanical wounds that cause an opening in the plasma membrane. The key biological questions probed include: What sets the limit of the biggest wound the cell can recover from? Does the large size of the cell facilitate its wound healing, or has wound healing evolved to be particularly rapid in this cell? The rationale to focus on Stentor are: 1) its wound healing capacity is more robust than most other cells, capable of recovering from drastic wounds and regenerating from cell fragments as small as 1/27th of original cell size in 24 hours. 2) The ability to perform high-throughput gene knockdown and wounding experiments. The research objectives are to: 1) Develop a minimalistic whole-cell mathematical model of single-cell wound healing. 2) Test predictions of the model by measuring the kinetics of healing in cells as a function of wound size and cell size. 3) Identify contributions to the healing process from membrane patching, purse-string constriction, or other mechanisms as identified by phosphoproteomics. The intellectual merit of this research lies in the identification of the principles for repairing large mechanical wounds in a single cell, and the conditions at which the healing process will succeed or fail. Fundamentally, the ability to heal is one of the key features that distinguish living matter from non-living matter. This study will shed light into the problem of how some biological systems can heal more robustly than others. Practically, the work will lay the foundation for engineering a new function?self-repair?in synthetic cells, and will make the technology more robust for potential scale-up for practical industrial applications.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function and Systems and Synthetic Biology clusters of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global warming is drastically altering rainfall patterns, increasing the risk of water scarcity. The rapid conversion of natural landscapes to urbanized areas that are continually growing in population further accentuates this issue. Sustainable management strategies are becoming critical to ensure the optimum use of essential but limited water resources on the planet. Often, river infrastructures such as dams, gates, and reservoirs are built to satisfy human societies' water and energy demands. However, the maintenance of costly engineered river infrastructures is still posing crucial problems related to reservoir sedimentation and ecosystem preservation. First, estimation methodologies that allow real-time quantification and monitoring of distributed profiles of sediments transported in a water channel from the measurement of appropriate quantities at gate locations will be developed. Second, flow control strategies for hydraulic systems governed by continuum models of density gradient induced by moving sediment will be exploited to ensure stable operation when gates release high discharges in the channel or reservoir, generating turbulence during sediment flushing or venting operations. An experimental setup that supports the feasibility and efficiency of the control/estimation methodologies will be designed. While advancing the science through the development of innovative real-time control and estimation approaches, the research program will be consolidated with an integrated educational plan with the introduction of a graduate course related to the research topic. This project will create opportunities for the participation of students in research and development in water management systems at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate levels.<br/><br/>The key idea of the research is to exploit PDE (Partial Differential Equation) boundary control techniques towards efficient water and sediment dynamics management. Fundamental balance equations reflecting the dynamics of coupled water and sediment waves, namely, the bilayer Saint-Venant model, which describes a multiphase flow with a density gradient, will be exploited to achieve the objective. The main difficulties to overcome involve the real-time monitoring of distributed sediment bed profiles and disturbances arising from flushing processes such as shock-waves and hydraulic jumps generated by significant gate discharges over channels. Strongly coupled nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs and mixed systems consisting of cascading hyperbolic PDEs and ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations) are relevant to the flow physics problems. The backstepping control technique combined with Lyapunov analysis will be employed to derive high-performance observers and controllers that solely use gate actuation dynamics and output measurements to enable fast and exponential stabilization at a prescribed setpoint. Various extensions of the theoretical outcomes of the research can essentially solve decisive challenges related to the control of traffic dynamics, networks of sewer systems, and pollutant transport in water flow, to name a few.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These creatures may seem trivial but are not -- they play an important role in forests by breaking down dead plants and recycling nutrients.

Microcontact soft lithography is an attractive cost-effective method of patterning meter square areas of micro- and nano-scale features via selective mechanical contact on flexible substrates using stamps. Adapting microcontact printing to continuous, roll-to-roll platforms facilitates applications such as flexible electronics and wearables. The fidelity of the transferred pattern in soft lithography is dependent on successful mechanical contact and control of material transfer at the stamp-substrate interface. However, the underlying microfeature evolution in commonly fabricated structures in roll-to-roll microcontact printing is not yet fully understood to guide the successful design and control of the printing process. This project studies a novel modeling approach for microcontact print pattern formation with real-time learning from the patterning processes while linking the pattern formation mechanisms with print process variations and defects for quality control. The research is complemented by the development of a multi-disciplinary curriculum combined with research in roll-to-roll printing and the creation of self-contained hands-on educational kits to encourage young students at various educational levels to pursue careers in manufacturing.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to understand the fundamental mechanics of microcontact printing through deep learning and establishing a scientific basis for roll-to-roll soft lithography. Towards this goal, the research objectives are: (1) Investigate a physical mechanics model of contact regions for the design and control of roll-to-roll microcontact printing; (2) Establish an in-line vision-force-deformation sensing network for assessing print geometry; and (3) Model real time stamp microfeature pattern-pressure-deformation behavior through deep learning.   The printed pattern images are systematically segmented and converted to a single geometric variable which is synchronized and integrated with the force and displacement data for describing the state of print. A deep learning architecture models the fidelity of a print pattern geometry by measurement of the print variables and contact geometries. The project seeks answers to the following questions: (i) What is the precise interpretable relationship between print variables and contact geometry; and (ii) What are the roles of contact geometries, material properties, and roll-to-roll printing parameters in the formation of pattern geometry. The overarching focus is to achieve a deep understanding of the deformation behavior of microcontact stamp and the formation mechanisms of print geometry. The project enriches the knowledge base for soft lithography modeling, real-time sensing, deep learning, and design and control of roll-to-roll print process and contributes to the advancements in intelligent manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

""Subduction zones"" are tectonic plate boundaries where one plate dives beneath another. They host Earth?s largest earthquakes and tsunamis. Both hazards are controlled by the mechanical properties of the rocks present along the boundary. These properties vary regionally due to different mineralogy in the host rocks. Rocks also undergo different physical and chemical changes as they are dragged into a subduction zone.  These changes affect their mechanical properties as well. Here, the team study the effects of different physical and chemical paths on the mechanical properties of subduction-zone rocks.  They carry out deformation experiments on rock specimens collected in targeted plate boundaries.  Results helps unveiling the behavior of faults generating megathrust earthquakes.  They also allow better assessing regional hazards. This project includes support for an early-career female scientist. In addition, it promotes a 3-part education plan to train students in rock mechanics at all levels, from K-12, to undergraduate and graduate levels. The 5-year award is co-funded by NSF Geophysics, Tectonics, and Marine Geology & Geophysics programs. <br/><br/>The shallowest extent of subduction megathrusts hosts a variety of slip modes, including tsunamigenic earthquakes. The mode of fault slip at shallow conditions is proposed to be controlled by the physical properties of the sediments and rocks along the plate boundary, as well as external conditions like pore fluid pressure and temperature. However, there is no comprehensive model for which lithologies control slip behavior.  How extrinsic variables control the deformation of these lithologies is also unclear. Here, the team studies experimentally  the path-dependent strength and deformation behavior of shallow subduction-zone rocks.

Superconductors have zero electrical resistance and strongly repel magnetic fields when electricity flows through them and therefore have applications for uses such as grids that can transmit power without energy loss, ultra-fast levitating trains that ride frictionless magnets instead of rails, and quantum computing devices. There is a demand for innovative approaches to the design and synthesis of new superconducting materials. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research and the Established Program to Support Competitive Research (EPSCoR), combines experimental investigation and theoretical assessment to reveal fundamental chemical principles to design new superconducting materials. The scientific significance of the research is to open a new chemical perspective towards superconductivity that focuses on the role of pairs of atoms of particular elements to accelerate the search for new superconductors. The proposed outreach activities and educational plan emphasize solid-state materials-related outreach activities including the development of dually communication-intensive certified and service-learning certified undergraduate courses and a vibrant research program for women and underrepresented minority students in the state of Louisiana.  These activities will expand the research capability of the state and foster the training of next-generation materials scientists.<br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project uses chemical strategies to probe the role of two new critical charge-transfer pairs of elements (Pd-P and Pt-P) in superconductivity.  The PI and her group use methods for solid-state materials discovery and physical properties characterization, targeting families of compounds selected in order to be able to probe the role of breaking or forming bonds between these specific pairs of elements.  Together with the experimental effort, theoretical determination of electronic structures and electron-phonon coupling provide feedback toward further synthetic efforts.  This approach advances knowledge about a comprehensive set of properties: structural influences on electronic and magnetic structures, electron-electron and electron-phonon correlations, magnetism, spin-orbit coupling effects, and their interplay in superconductors. The educational plan will focus on developing and establishing service-learning pedagogies for solid-state materials in the state of Louisiana. This gives university students experiential opportunities to learn in real-world contexts and develop skills of community engagement while providing outreach demonstrations relating to superconductivity and other properties to K-12 schools.

Complex manifolds are higher-dimensional surfaces that are defined using the complex numbers. Recently, there has been significant progress in the study of ""metrics"" on complex manifolds, objects that endow these spaces with a shape or more precisely, curvature. The study of these metrics lies at the nexus of complex geometry and geometric analysis. The aim of this conference is to gather together experts working in these two fields to discuss these new and exciting developments. Even though lately there have been many conferences in complex geometry, none have really been organised to address these recent discoveries. This conference serves to fulfill this necessity. In doing so, it will promote collaboration across many areas of the aforementioned fields of complex geometry and geometric analysis. The latest breakthroughs in these two fields will be presented to a new generation of mathematicians, with a particular emphasis on women and those from minority groups. The conference will provide a forum for senior mathematicians to interact with graduate students through the organisation of an optional poster presentation for graduate students which will take place in a non-intimidating and relaxed environment. Ample opportunity will also be provided to women speakers to present their research, with at least one talk per day scheduled for a female speaker. Moreover, the conference will provide a platform for postdocs and junior researchers to present their work. Participants will be brought up-to-date with all of the current developments in the field and will be presented with new avenues of research in the enticing environment that Miami provides in the Winter.<br/> <br/>More specifically, the Conference on Special Metrics in Complex Geometry will concentrate on the interplay between complex geometry and geometric analysis, with an emphasis being given to equations arising in the construction of hermitian and Kahler metrics with prescribed curvature properties, for example, the complex Monge-Ampere equation in Kahler geometry. These equations are among the most important appearing in geometric analysis and understanding their structure and the techniques involved in their solution are paramount for further progress in the field. Recent breakthroughs include, among others, the independent construction of non-flat Ricci-flat Kahler metrics with maximal volume growth on complex affine space of dimensions three and greater by Li, Conlon-Rochon, and Szekelyhidi, the construction of new examples of gradient expanding and steady Kahler-Ricci solitons by Conlon-Deruelle and Biquard-Macbeth respectively, the solution by Chen-Cheng of a major conjecture of Tian stating the equivalence between the existence of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics on a compact Kahler manifold and the properness of Mabuchi's K-energy, and the recent families of Ricci-flat Kahler metrics exhibited by Hein-Sun-Viaclovsky-Zhang on K3 surfaces which collapse to an interval with Tian-Yau and Taub-NUT metrics occurring as bubbles. These topics will all form part of the conversation at the conference in January 2021.

The objective of this research is to understand what makes biological puncturing tools (fangs, spines, stingers, etc.) so effective. To do this, the project will: 1) study how much energy different biological tools use to puncture tissue, and 2) see how energy use has influenced the evolutionary history of puncturing tool design in various living groups. To accomplish these goals, the research will combine experiments with mathematical analyses, and show how a fang, spine or stinger?s shape, along with how it is moved, interacts with the nature of the material that is punctured to produce specific kinds and amounts of damage. These data will be used to understand how energy flows during puncture and uncover how puncturing ability evolved in snakes, wasps, and cacti. Improved knowledge of the effectiveness of puncture in nature will facilitate advances in robotics and biomedical technology, such as developing puncture resistance in soft robots and better understanding of how biological tissue is damaged during traumatic impacts. The researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, and develop a suite of educational modules in partnership with local teachers that will be disseminated across the country. These materials will integrate natural and applied sciences and will include lesson plans and resources aimed at a range of educational levels. Lesson plans will not require expensive materials, and will be translated into several languages.<br/><br/>Puncture is a widespread mechanism of both defense and attack in the biological realm, with examples found in many phyla, spanning orders of magnitude in scale. This research will examine how the physical principles underlying performance influence the function and evolution of biological puncture systems. The diversity of these systems allows exploration of how organisms that differ in scale, structure and kinematics have evolved to overcome common mechanical challenges. Examining commonalities across systems also gives insight into the physical laws that underlie those challenges. This research will employ a combination of experimental data collection and comparative analyses to achieve two aims: 1) controlled experimental analyses will establish a set of energy balance equations that model how morphological, material and kinematic variables influence biologically-relevant puncture mechanics, and 2) comparative analyses using the models will explore the evolution of puncture mechanics in venomous snakes, parasitoid wasps and cacti. Results of these analyses will be used to identify common principles that underlie the evolution of multiple mechanical puncture systems, and thus give insight into how physics influences the evolutionary rules of life. This program will create a framework that can be used by others for a broad range of topics, including identifying kinematic performance variables of particular adaptive value in prey capture systems; examining the role of rate-dependency in biological materials on tissue damage during high impact; and developing fracture resistant materials for soft robotics. This framework will also be used to develop adaptable teaching modules aimed at a range of educational levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How would the first humans to inhabit a region make a living?  How would they organize themselves socially?   In a place and time where there are few constraints on how people might behave other than those imposed by the natural environment, what would human societies look like?  The first Americans, entered ecosystems that were home to mammoths, mastodons, horses, camels, and ground sloths.  Since no similar environments remain today, archaeology is the only field that provides a window into human lives in such contexts. Although similar stories played out through prehistory as the human species expanded across the globe, this research will provide insight into human social organization in one such case, the colonization of North America.<br/> <br/>The researchers will contribute to ongoing debates concerning the subsistence practices of the first Americans.  Did early Paleoindians preferentially target large mammal species, or did they have a broad diet breadth?  They will also examine aspects of cooperation in butchery of megafauna as well as questions aggregation and dispersal of hunter-gatherer households.  These opportunities are afforded by additional excavation of the La Prele Mammoth site in Converse County, Wyoming.  This site preserves the remains of a killed or scavenged subadult Columbian mammoth and an associated camp occupied during  butchery.  Multiple hearth-centered activity areas associated with and encircling the mammoth provide the opportunity to examine aspects of social organization using detailed lithic, faunal, and spatial analysis.  This work will not only provide opportunities to train and support graduate and undergraduate students, but it will provide opportunities to train members of the Northern Arapaho tribe in archaeological field methods.

Of interest to Dr. Bangasser?s laboratory, is the ability of stress to impair certain types of memory. Previous researchers have studied this question by exploring whether stress hormones directly impact a region critical for declarative (e.g., autobiographical) and spatial memory, called the hippocampus. However, the hippocampus is part of a memory circuit and it receives input from another region called the medial septum. The studies in this project will investigate how a stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor, impacts the medial septum of male and female rats to disrupt memory. Preliminary data indicate that females are more resilient to the memory deficits caused by corticotropin releasing factor and a goal of the project is to determine why. Experiments will evaluate how gonadal hormones and sex differences in corticotropin releasing factor binding protein ? which reduces the efficacy of corticotropin releasing factor ? promote female resilience to the memory defects caused by corticotropin releasing factor in the medial septum. Additionally, chemical changes in the hippocampus that result from corticotropin releasing factor in the medial septum will be investigated to better understand circuits by which stress can affect memory. The results may eventually be utilized to develop compounds that improve cognition in healthy subjects experiencing stress, as well as in patients with disorders characterized by stress dysregulation and mnemonic impairments (e.g., patients with schizophrenia and depression). <br/><br/><br/>Stress impairs hippocampus (HPC)-dependent memory, so many researchers investigate how stress hormones directly impact HPC function. Yet, the HPC does not work in isolation, but is regulated by afferent structures, such as cholinergic projections from the medial septum (MS). Dr. Bangasser?s laboratory discovered that the stress neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), administered to the MS impairs HPC-dependent spatial memory, and males are more sensitive to this effect. Female resilience to CRF in the MS was not due to ovarian hormones but was associated with an increase in CRF binding protein (CRF-BP), which reduces the bioavailability of CRF. This project will determine how this sex difference is established and how CRF in the MS regulates the HPC. Aim 1 will test whether testosterone mediates male vulnerability to the spatial memory deficit caused by CRF in the MS. Aim 2 will characterize the sex difference in CRF-BP in the MS by first determining the MS cell-type that expresses CRF-BP and identifying sex differences therein. Next, CRF-BP function will be blocked in females to see if it increases their sensitivity to the low dose of CRF in the MS, mimicking the male effect. Aim 3 will use amperometric recordings to confirm that CRF in the MS alters ACh release in the HPC. Then proper ACh levels will be restored to assess if this rescues the mnemonic deficit resulting from CRF in the MS. Collectively, these studies will determine how biological sex and CRF interact to drive vulnerability vs. resilience to stress-induced cognitive changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An increasing number of studies show that behavioral traits, such as boldness or aggression, can influence life history traits, such as survival. A key question that remains is whether these individual-level traits can have larger-scale effects. The goal of this study is to quantify the ecological consequences of individual variation in behavior in wild populations subject to various degrees of human disturbance, and in turn, how individual variation in animal behavior can affect community-level processes. This project will be conducted through an integrated research and education plan, in which the principal investigator will lead a team of graduate and undergraduate students along with citizen scientists to collect data on wild populations of small mammals. The team will quantify individual variation in traits such as boldness and aggression in populations of wild small mammals that are subject to various degrees of human disturbance, and determine how survival relates to variation in these traits. Concurrently, researchers will study the dispersal of seeds by individuals with different behavioral traits, quantifying the effects of animal actions on plant community dynamics. Undergraduate students will learn how to quantify personality (in animals and humans) and will participate in workshops focused on improving their scientific communication skills. Using approaches targeted for their own personalities, undergraduate students will then engage high school students in two citizen science projects, which will become critical components of the research program. <br/><br/>Consistent individual differences in behavior, or personality, play a key role in determining how individual animals experience and interact with their changing environment. The extent to which the distribution of behavioral types in a population affects larger-scale ecological processes such as population dynamics and forest regeneration is poorly understood. To contribute to filling these knowledge gaps this project will focus on: 1) Assessing the response of individuals with different, yet consistent behavioral repertoires to land-use change and 2) Quantifying the effects of the diversity of behaviors within a population on the demographics and structure of plant communities within disturbed landscapes. The study will be conducted through a large-scale field experiment in Maine using small mammal species as a model system. Through the field experiment the team will assess the effects of land-use change (i.e., silvicultural practices) on survival of animals with different personality types, concurrently assessing the capacity for diversity in animal behavior to influence population dynamics. The researchers will also characterize how personality-driven seed predation and dispersal decisions affect the seed bank composition and how these decisions may interact with climate change to affect range shifts of plants. The insights and models generated by this project will illuminate the link between individual variation and population, community, and ecosystem dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These blood cell-forming HSCs primarily reside in trabecular bone marrow (TBM), which is the tissue in the porous end of long bones such as femurs. HSC transplantation is the most successful stem cell therapy, but its clinical impact has been limited by the availability of HSCs.  HSC?s are difficult to grow outside the body where they tend to change (differentiate) and lose their ability to develop into any blood cell type. To address the need for a scalable method to grow HSCs without allowing differentiation, the goal of this CAREER project is to develop biomaterial models that mimic the microenvironments of TBM for HSC growth and maintenance. Once developed, the biomaterial models will be combined and integrated into a TBM model in bioreactor designed to growth HSCs.  Successful TBM models will advance understanding of bone remodeling associated with aging and the progression of diseases such as osteoporosis and bone cancers, and they may also serve as an alternative to animals during preclinical drug testing.  Furthermore, the project will be used to recruit and educate students with diverse backgrounds to face emerging challenges at the intersection between engineering and medicine. Activities include an integrated lecture and lab curriculum for a tissue engineering course, an interdisciplinary team-based (engineering and biology) capstone projects for undergraduate students, and a summer research program for high school girls aligned with the existing Engineering the Cell program.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goals are to deliver translational bioengineered solutions that can advance our understanding of the trabecular bone marrow (TBM) in health and disease and harness the regenerative potential of the TBM.  Toward this goal, the aim of this CAREER project is to elucidate the dynamic structure-function relationship that maintains hematopoietic activity in the TBM and to apply this knowledge to design a scalable bioreactor for expanding hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).  Two observations, (1) that blood-forming HSCs primarily reside and function in cavities that maintain comparable bone thickness and cavity diameters while undergoing constant bone remodeling and (2) that aging-associated decrease in trabecular bone thickness and increase in cavity diameters are related to a decrease in hematopoietic activity, suggest a possible relationship between anatomy and function that maintains hematopoietic activity in the TBM.  Thus, the project?s central hypothesis is that there exist optimal dimensions and spatial arrangement that effectively coordinate bidirectional crosstalk between the endosteal and vascular niches, which are the two important anatomical and functional niches in the TBM. The project builds on the investigator?s development of (1) inverted colloidal crystal (ICC) hydrogel scaffolds that closely emulate anatomical and physical features of the vascular niche and (2) demineralized bone paper that preserves intact biochemical and structural aspects of the endosteal niche and exhibits biological significance in reproducing the surface and subsurface bone tissue complexity of bone, including osteocytes. The Research Plan is organized under four Objectives:  (1) To develop an endosteal niche model that recapitulates bone remodeling-related HSC biology by refining an endosteal niche model in which osteocytes buried in layers of demineralized bone paper under mechanoculture re-create physiological aspects of bone surface and subsurface; (2) To develop a vascular niche model that emulates vascular perfusion-related HSC biology by refining the model of the vascular niche to mimic molecular gradients under perfusion within a microfluidic hydrogel scaffold that supports culture of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs); (3) To combine the endosteal and vascular niche models into an integrated TBM model by integrating individually optimized models into a single platform to re-create the differentiation-suppressing quality of the endosteal niche and the proliferation-stimulating quality of the vascular niche and (4) To assemble multiple TBM models into a scalable bioreactor that will maintain a stable level of molecular and mechanical interactions between the endosteal and vascular niches to support the expansion phase of HSCs.  To determine the competitive advantages and weaknesses of the ex vivo HSC expansion bioreactor compared to other solutions, a limiting dilution assay will be conducted to determine the in vivo repopulating potential of the culture-expanded HSCs by intravenous injection into sublethally irradiated mice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, limitations to developing SOC yet to be overcome include: 1) the atmospheric channel is dynamic and not well-understood, preventing its statistical characterization; 2) the traditional communication system design ignores full use of relevant information from real-time data; 3) the complexity of the systems required to achieve the performance gain of SOC (over RF) would increase rapidly, hence SOC engineering solutions must incorporate the complexity as a constraint. To address these challenges, this research develops a systematic design framework which combines model-based and data-driven design paradigms for SOC and where the system 1) models and predicts the long-term dynamics of the atmospheric channel, and 2) proactively adapts its communication and networking strategy to the dynamics of the environment, thereby maximizing end-to-end system performances in terms of data rates, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and link reliability. The proposed approach will demonstrate how SOC can be a reliable platform that complements existing technologies to fulfill the requirements of easy deployment, high data rates, and affordable complexity of future systems. Potential benefits of the project include deploying broadband internet via optical drones in poor countries, thus enabling access to information and education; ensuring connectivity between aircraft, thus improving the safety, reliability, and efficiency of air travel; and enhancing the reliability of space exploratory missions, thus increasing our potential for discovery. The research effort will be integrated with the principal investigator's educational career goal of promoting undergraduate research, encouraging enrollment of high-school students in STEM and recruiting underrepresented students by working with the institution's existing diversity recruitment and support programs.<br/><br/>Current communication systems are either difficult to deploy at large scale or limited by the RF spectrum licensing burdens. This project's contributions are significant because they show, via a mix of theoretical and practical frameworks, how SOC can be a reliable platform that complements and enhances existing technologies. The first objective of the research is to derive the performance limits of SOC, which describe the best error probability and channel capacity that a well-designed system can achieve in various relevant settings such as multiple access and relay channels, and accounting for atmospheric impairments. To mitigate the atmospheric effects, a sharp statistical channel model will be devised. The work will encompass deep-space, near-earth and space system networks. While deep space communication is well described via the Poisson channel model, the effects of the atmospheric attenuation and pointing error could be captured via statistical models. Depending on the communication scenarios, an input-dependent or an input-independent Gaussian noise could also be incorporated. The methodology to undertake this objective is based on applying tools from information and communication theories along with a non-parametric statistical channel learning approach. The second objective is to develop powerful machine learning techniques to perform signal classification, estimate parameters of the atmosphere, determine the mapping between input and output data and infer probability distributions in order to design communication systems that can efficiently perform without relying heavily on channel models. Block structure Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based as well as end-to-end DNN-based designs, for point-to-point and multiuser settings, will be considered. The methodology to undertake this objective relies mainly on designing SOC auto-encoders with gradient-free optimization techniques and block structure DNN-based channel estimation, signal classification, and detection.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems (CCSS) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has strong implications for our understanding of earthquakes and associated hazards. Earthquakes occur periodically; their recurrence is due to the ""stick-slip"" behavior of large fractures in the Earth?s crust, called faults. A fault ""sticks"" in the time periods between earthquakes and ""slips"" during earthquakes. The stick-slip motion arises from the interaction of the elastic (spring-like) behavior of relatively cold rocks and the frictional behavior of faults. Rock friction has been extensively studied in the laboratory because of its relevance to earthquakes. Empirical equations ? that is, derived from experimental data rather than based on known mechanisms ? describe how friction varies with time and sliding velocity. Computer models use these equations to reproduce a wide range of earthquake-related phenomena. However, the physical and/or chemical processes underlying these equations are still largely unknown; identifying and quantifying them is critical for applying laboratory results to geological faults. Here, the research team investigates these processes at the microscale and nanoscale of the asperities (bumps) on the fault surface where fault rocks are in actual contact. They use atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation to mimic the behavior of single asperities and to measure their behavior at small scales. Feeding the results of experiments into computer simulations that incorporate larger scales,  they model and predict the frictional behaviors of rock surfaces. Ultimately, the researchers aim to develop new equations that better capture the behavior of earthquake faults and improve hazard assessment. This project also provides support to two graduate students and a postdoctoral associate. It fosters training for undergraduate students and outreach to high-school students and teachers, notably from underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>Empirical rate-and-state friction laws, which describe the frictional sliding behavior of faults, are commonly used in earthquake models. Their physical basis is largely unknown, particularly for the equations that describe the evolution of the ""state"" of a frictional interface. This renders the extrapolation of laboratory results to geological faults fraught with uncertainty. A common explanation of frictional ""state"" is that it represents the true area of contact on a fault surface; this area evolves (increases) with time or slip due to asperity yielding and creep. An emerging alternative is that contacts strengthen due to chemical bonding at contact junctions. The team previously demonstrated ? using single-asperity atomic force microscopy and coordinated with computer simulations, and with nanoindentation experiments - that both mechanisms may contribute to the increase of friction with time (or slip), an effect termed frictional aging.  A unifying hypothesis is that asperity creep and chemical bonding occur simultaneously at asperity contacts, but that aging is due primarily to chemical bonding. In this scenario, contact area and chemical bonding are inextricably linked, with asperity yielding and creep providing the contact area upon which chemical bonding occurs. Here, the research team will conduct novel experiments and simulations at the nexus of geophysics, chemistry, materials science, and mechanics to unveil the physical basis for rate-and-state friction. Specifically, they seek to 1) elucidate the roles of yielding and creep of asperities in friction, 2) explore the influences of temperature and fluid chemistry on surface aging and 3) elucidate the roles of slip versus time in state evolution. They employ specimens made of silica and quartz and, for the first time, amorphous alumina, sapphire and feldspar. Results from single-asperity experiments are integrated into simulations which describe the behavior of rough rock surfaces in contact via multiscale modeling. The models incorporate asperity yielding and creep with chemical bonding effects for the first time, allowing new insights into rate-and-state friction behavior of rock surfaces and faults. This project may lead to a paradigm shift with transformative implications for understanding earthquake nucleation, and for the assessment of earthquake hazards and associated risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gene expression is guided by proteins called transcription factors. The transcription factor TWIST is important for the formation of different cell types by helping induce changes that cause epithelial cells to become mesenchymal cells during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although EMT is required for proper organ development, EMT also endows cells with potentially detrimental migration and invasion properties, and thus must be tightly regulated. This project will provide a better understanding of how EMT is controlled by defining specific mechanisms that change the molecular structure and activity of TWIST by using a novel platform to rapidly identify proteins that recognize these changes in molecular structure. Overall, the project will also provide an ideal opportunity for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in molecular biology and proteomics, as well as introducing elementary, high school, and undergraduate students, particularly those in underrepresented minority groups, to basic science research and advanced technology. In addition, this project will provide science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) opportunities in a rural area with few options for students with STEM interests through established educational and community outreach programs. <br/><br/>Information is relayed from the cell surface into the nucleus through the process of signal transduction. Signal transduction is driven by protein interactions that are controlled by posttranslational modifications (PTM). Typically, a specific protein domain on one protein recognizes or ?reads? the PTM signal present on its interacting partners. This project will address fundamental questions regarding the crosstalk between PTMs in the regulation of transcriptional programs that govern EMT. A recently discovered regulatory node on the transcription factor TWIST1 potentially harbors a combinatorial code consisting of three distinct PTMs that occur within six amino acid residues of each other. The code is established through lysine and arginine methylation by SETD6 and PRMT1, respectively, and lysine ubiquitinylation by RNF8. The project seeks to define the molecular crosstalk among these enzymes, and how they function to promote EMT through TWIST1. An important part of dissecting the molecular mechanism of signaling through this methyl/ubiquitin node on TWIST1 is a novel protein domain microarray platform that will be used to rapidly identify protein-protein interactions dependent upon specific PTMs and combinations of PTMs. This platform will help answer fundamental questions including: 1) which protein domains bind each of these different PTMs in the TWIST1 methyl/ubiquitin regulatory node; and 2) whether specific combinations of these PTMs block or facilitate protein interactions? This study will provide not only a basic mechanistic understanding of how the distinct PTMs on TWIST regulate each other, and how they regulate interactions with other proteins, in the context of EMT, but also a broader perspective on how PTMs might regulate protein-protein interactions in general. <br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With this project the researchers aim to better understand the structure and function of a plant enzyme that they suspect plays and unusual role in starch metabolism. Potential long-term benefits of the research include modified crops that contain starch with properties suitable for improved food and industrial applications. In some plants this enzyme is encoded by a complex gene, the understanding of which could shed light on how genes evolve. The research will be carried out at a predominantly undergraduate institution and involve at least 12 undergraduates helping prepare them for graduate school and careers in science. The students will be involved in all aspects of the work. In addition, the project will support a postdoctoral scholar that will obtain valuable teaching experience in lectures and laboratories of introductory and advanced courses, as well as bringing valuable intellectual and technical assets to the lab. Most importantly, they will be able to develop undergraduate research mentoring skills and acquire practical advice for building a successful career at a predominantly undergraduate institution.<br/><br/>Starch is a complex polymer of glucose composed mostly of amylopectin, a highly branched molecule with layers of short chains that are 12-15 glucose units long. In green leaves starch accumulates during the day and is broken down at night so that the leaf can continue to export energy to the entire plant even when photosynthesis is not active. One of the key enzymes known to play an important role in starch degradation is beta-amylase, which hydrolyzes the disaccharide maltose from the ends of amylopectin. The researchers recently discovered that one of the beta-amylases in Arabidopsis called BAM2 is unlike all of the other characterized BAMs in that it is a tetramer, requires K+ for activity, possesses a secondary starch-binding site, and has sigmoidal kinetics. Based on these properties the researchers developed a hypothesis that BAM2 plays a role in starch synthesis as a trimming enzyme to ensure that the short amylopectin chains are of the proper length. To test this hypothesis, they will investigate the catalytic and starch-binding properties of the wildtype and mutant enzymes in detail. In addition, the function of the enzyme will be tested by characterizing the structure of starch isolated from wildtype and mutant plants lacking BAM2. The researchers will also investigate the localization and properties of the BAM2-like protein in rice plants that appears to be part of a longer BAM7 gene with two putative transcriptional start sites. Understanding the role of BAM2 in starch metabolism could have a significant impact on biotechnological efforts to enhance starch yield in crops. The experiments described here may shed light on how starch binding to an allosteric surface of BAM2 influences its catalytic activity. The work may also reveal how novel genes can be generated by fusion events and how they can evolve through duplication and neofunctionalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These range from minor setbacks to life-changing tragedies.  In such times of distress, receiving appropriate support from close relationship partners is important for personal and social well-being.  Yet people in distress often do not receive the support they need.  Decades of research has documented the benefits of social support, but the research has not typically focused on actions that people can take to increase their chances of getting support that meets their needs.  This project focuses on one particular type of support-seeking behavior that has not been emphasized in distress-related situations: expressing positive thoughts and feelings.  Examples of such positive behavior include the expression of optimism about the distressing event or gratitude toward the support-providing partner.  The research examines when and for whom expressing such positivity is useful in obtaining support for negative events.  The findings are expected to inform the development of interventions to help people more effectively seek the support they need in times of distress.<br/><br/>Drawing on theory and research on emotional expressivity, social support, and close relationships, this project tests a contextual model of support-eliciting behavior that involves the expression of positive thoughts and feelings.  In one study, romantic partners are videotaped during the course of support conversations. Two other laboratory experiments control the extent of positive expressivity in support-seeking messages.  The studies will inform our understanding of when and for whom positive expressivity promotes responsive support.  The first study will also include a longitudinal follow-up, which will permit an examination of downstream personal and relational consequences of support-seeking and support-giving processes.  It is expected that support-seekers' positive expressivity will enhance providers' responsive support.  This result should be especially strong when features of support seekers, support providers, their relationships, or the stressors lead support providers to be low in feelings of warmth and connectedness toward support seekers.  It should also be especially strong when contextual features lead support providers to doubt the effectiveness of their support efforts.  Focusing on the joint influences of positive expressivity and contextual features will advance basic knowledge about how people can successfully elicit social support in coping with distressing events.  The research will help to identify targets for future interventions aimed at enhancing the personal and social well-being of people as they experience distressing events in their daily lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finally, the use of micropatterned seed features for templated growth and surface coating with these gammaPNA nanomaterials is investigated.  Unlike electronegative DNA-based systems, PNA-based systems have a tendency to stick together forming bundles. By leveraging that distinct characteristic, superstructure formation using not only gammaPNA oligomer sequence but also external conditions like surface hydrophobicity could be controlled.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Personality type, learning environment, stress, and genetics are some of the variables that can influence cognitive capabilities (e.g. learning and memory). How these factors interact to contribute to differences in learning and memory between individuals, is poorly understood. Personality type can consistently bias cognitive, behavioral, and physiological responses to disparate challenges. Organisms with proactive (i.e. ?bold?) personality type, are more likely more risk-prone, routine oriented, and show a low stress response. In contrast, reactive (i.e. ?shy?) animals, are more risk-averse, sensitive to environmental change, and have a higher stress response. This project will examine how an personality type constrains learning and memory capabilities and elucidate the underlying neurobiological and genetic mechanisms. Investigation of how learning context, brain dynamics, and genetics modulate learning and memory, will provides targets for understanding what could drive biased cognitive responses and serve as important factors in constraining behavioral variation. This project will also opportunities for University of Nebraska at Omaha and K-12 students of the Omaha Public Schools district to perform behavioral neurogenetics experiments and enhance scientific literacy and comprehension.<br/><br/>Exposure to stress often results in learning, and the memory of past experience can inform future behavioral response. Differences in learning and memory performance are attributable, in part, to environmental conditions (e.g. context, reinforcement type) and personality type. Key differences in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission that distinguish alternative personality types (e.g. proactive and reactive stress coping styles) may also inform differences in learning and memory. Variations in learning and memory performance may be driven by specific neural activity patterns across brain regions. Activity of and in neural network in turn, may be arranged and influenced by the expression of genes related to synaptic plasticity. The experiments will identify how context and reinforcement type interact with personality type to produce variation in associative and spatial learning and memory performance. Further, these studies will elucidate how neural and gene transcriptional activities can account for variation in learning and memory between and within reinforcement types. Specifically, the necessity of candidate genes in learning will be assessed via the manipulation of gene expression. The experiments in this project will lead to advancements in understanding how (1) learning environment and personality type (i.e stress coping style) intersect and (2) gene expression and neural activity integrate to mediate variation of learning and memory that may explain constraints on behavioral plasticity.

For example, insufficient rates of vaccination could place U.S. children at greater risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and preventing the adoption of genetically modified (GM)  crops can hurt local economies and farmers. Why are people sometimes reluctant to adopt beliefs that are in line with scientific consensus? We investigate the social influence of peers, a factor that is known to be important for belief formation but is still insufficiently understood: For example, parents who are reluctant to vaccinate their healthy children are often clustered in the same neighborhoods, and information from social environments and cultural differences have a strong influence on the acceptance of GM food. In a longitudinal experimental study of parents and their peers, we investigate the mechanisms underlying peers? social influence: informational cues one receives from peers, and social network cues that reinforce the need to be in sync with peers' views. For example, disagreeing with a well-connected peer can lead to disapproval by others in one's social network and loss of valuable connections; whereas disagreeing with a less prominent member might not matter as much. This project will inform the design of public education interventions that leverage the theoretical knowledge about how social networks influence people?s beliefs about science, while providing transparent information about scientific consensus and promoting people?s own agency when forming their beliefs. These interventions can be applied to a broad range of science topics of national interest.<br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying belief change, or lack of it, after exposure to others with different beliefs. We focus on beliefs about scientific issues that affect day to day family-level decisions: childhood vaccination and GM food. We will develop a conceptual framework and use a longitudinal experimental study to investigate two questions: First, how important are different informational and social network cues for social dissonance? Integrating literatures on social dissonance and social networks, we propose that the extent of social dissonance individuals feel when encountering a peer with a different belief depends on perceived informational and social network cues. Second, what is the relative importance of social learning and belief protection strategies in reducing social dissonance, and how does the choice of strategy depend on social network cues? Building on the literatures on social learning and motivated cognition, we propose that individuals can resolve their social dissonance by either changing their beliefs in line with their peers? beliefs (social learning) or by protecting their existing beliefs (belief protection). Using a web-based platform SciFriends (NSF-MMS #1560592), we investigate experimentally whether this framework can explain when and why people become more or less influenced by the beliefs of their peers, and of scientists.

Currently, lithium ion battery electrode materials are prone to degrade when the battery is repeatedly used and recharged. Specifically, cathode materials degrade in the highly energetic, corrosive battery environment. To overcome these challenges and to make the cathode materials more stable, a novel manufacturing process is used to wrap a protective conducting polymer layer around the nanoparticles that make up the cathode. This process creates an extremely thin film that helps keep the underlying cathode nanoparticles active. The electrically conducting polymer maintains a well-connected battery circuit and provides a physically dense and chemically stable barrier for maximum protection. This project studies the oxidative chemical vapor deposition process to manufacture protected cathode materials for more stable, high performance batteries. The ability to coat miniscule parts and components with ultrathin conducting polymers impacts broader energy technology areas such as solar cells, fuel cells and supercapacitors, which creates a more sustainable U.S. energy economy. Furthermore, this coating technology enables applications in sensors, electronics, smart textiles, biomedical and aerospace industries that makes U.S. manufacturing more competitive. This research involves disciplines of manufacturing, materials science, electrochemistry and nanotechnology that attracts broad participation, particularly from underrepresented groups and women, and helps equip the future U.S. workforce with cutting-edge science and value-added skill-sets.<br/><br/>The oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) process is a solvent-free thin film coating technique that directly polymerizes the monomer vapor into a solid intrinsically conducting polymer (ICP) film through the use of an oxidant vapor. Being liquid-free, it overcomes conventional solvent processing problems of encapsulating conducting polymer coatings around cathode nanoparticles. Conducting polymers are often not very soluble so they are not amenable to solution processing. Furthermore, liquid methods are often less precise, which makes it difficult to produce ultrathin, nanoscale coatings. The dry oCVD process shows promise in overcoming these manufacturing barriers. However, this technology is relatively new, and this research fills the knowledge gap by identifying the key processing factors and mechanisms for achieving conformal, fully encapsulating ICP coatings around particle substrates. The research further understands the precise role of the coatings in stabilizing cathode materials and enhancing battery performance. The research team conducts a comprehensive experimental analysis from materials fabrication to device testing to understand the relevant processing-structure-property relationships for achieving maximum cathode protection and superior battery performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has strong implications for our understanding of earthquakes and associated hazards. Earthquakes occur periodically; their recurrence is due to the ""stick-slip"" behavior of large fractures in the Earth?s crust, called faults. A fault ""sticks"" in the time periods between earthquakes and ""slips"" during earthquakes. The stick-slip motion arises from the interaction of the elastic (spring-like) behavior of relatively cold rocks and the frictional behavior of faults. Rock friction has been extensively studied in the laboratory because of its relevance to earthquakes. Empirical equations ? that is, derived from experimental data rather than based on known mechanisms ? describe how friction varies with time and sliding velocity. Computer models use these equations to reproduce a wide range of earthquake-related phenomena. However, the physical and/or chemical processes underlying these equations are still largely unknown; identifying and quantifying them is critical for applying laboratory results to geological faults. Here, the research team investigates these processes at the microscale and nanoscale of the asperities (bumps) on the fault surface where fault rocks are in actual contact. They use atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation to mimic the behavior of single asperities and to measure their behavior at small scales. Feeding the results of experiments into computer simulations that incorporate larger scales,  they model and predict the frictional behaviors of rock surfaces. Ultimately, the researchers aim to develop new equations that better capture the behavior of earthquake faults and improve hazard assessment. This project also provides support to two graduate students and a postdoctoral associate. It fosters training for undergraduate students and outreach to high-school students and teachers, notably from underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>Empirical rate-and-state friction laws, which describe the frictional sliding behavior of faults, are commonly used in earthquake models. Their physical basis is largely unknown, particularly for the equations that describe the evolution of the ""state"" of a frictional interface. This renders the extrapolation of laboratory results to geological faults fraught with uncertainty. A common explanation of frictional ""state"" is that it represents the true area of contact on a fault surface; this area evolves (increases) with time or slip due to asperity yielding and creep. An emerging alternative is that contacts strengthen due to chemical bonding at contact junctions. The team previously demonstrated ? using single-asperity atomic force microscopy and coordinated with computer simulations, and with nanoindentation experiments - that both mechanisms may contribute to the increase of friction with time (or slip), an effect termed frictional aging.  A unifying hypothesis is that asperity creep and chemical bonding occur simultaneously at asperity contacts, but that aging is due primarily to chemical bonding. In this scenario, contact area and chemical bonding are inextricably linked, with asperity yielding and creep providing the contact area upon which chemical bonding occurs. Here, the research team will conduct novel experiments and simulations at the nexus of geophysics, chemistry, materials science, and mechanics to unveil the physical basis for rate-and-state friction. Specifically, they seek to 1) elucidate the roles of yielding and creep of asperities in friction, 2) explore the influences of temperature and fluid chemistry on surface aging and 3) elucidate the roles of slip versus time in state evolution. They employ specimens made of silica and quartz and, for the first time, amorphous alumina, sapphire and feldspar. Results from single-asperity experiments are integrated into simulations which describe the behavior of rough rock surfaces in contact via multiscale modeling. The models incorporate asperity yielding and creep with chemical bonding effects for the first time, allowing new insights into rate-and-state friction behavior of rock surfaces and faults. This project may lead to a paradigm shift with transformative implications for understanding earthquake nucleation, and for the assessment of earthquake hazards and associated risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One strategy utilized by a plasmid present in budding yeast is to attach itself to the host chromosomes and ?hitchhike? to daughter cells within a growing cell population. Research supported by this project will map the chromosomal locations where one such yeast plasmid attaches, and then characterize the plasmid and host factors that contribute to hitchhiking. The experimental approaches will utilize current genome-wide methodologies that will be performed by post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high-school seniors (as summer trainees). The findings from this study will be incorporated into 4-5 lectures on Selfish DNA that will form part of an upper division undergraduate course and a first year graduate course. Some of the experiments will be carried out under the Freshmen Research Initiative Program at UT Austin. Through the ?UT Austin Community Outreach,? High School seniors from urban areas of minority and low socioeconomic status will also participate in a program of supervised research. In coordination with UTeach Outreach Institute, a learning module on ?Selfishness of Genes and Genomes? designed to awaken scientific curiosity among middle and high school students will be developed. Overall, this scientific undertaking is expected to have far-reaching societal impact by advancing basic science, developing new technologies and contributing to human health.<br/><br/>Current evidence suggests that the partitioning system of the yeast 2-micron plasmid tethers plasmid sisters formed by replication to sister chromatids, enabling their chromosome-like 1:1 segregation. Yet direct proof of this hitchhiking model is lacking. According to the investigator's working hypothesis, interactions between plasmid partitioning proteins and host chromatin binding proteins are responsible for plasmid localization to chromosomal loci. The researchers will identify and characterize plasmid tethering sites on chromosomes by two independent but complementary high-throughput approaches: ChIP-seq and 4C-seq. The expectation is that there will be considerable overlap between DNA sequences enriched by the two methods. By refining the data from the two approaches using multiple controls, and by filtering the data sets from one against the other, the investigators will be able to define authentic plasmid tethering sites on chromosomes with high confidence. They will then test how tethering efficiency and plasmid stability are affected by mutational inactivation of a number of plasmid and host proteins that are implicated in tethering. This study will provide the most rigorous test of the hitchhiking model for plasmid segregation and will impact a model for the convergent evolution of chromosome-coupled survival strategies among selfish DNA elements as diverse as the yeast plasmid and mammalian viruses. It will thus shed new light on the mechanistic understanding of the shared lifestyles of selfish DNA elements that inhabit evolutionarily distant hosts. It will also help design simple, effective and innovative strategies for maintaining beneficial extra-chromosomal elements in eukaryotic host cells and for eliminating harmful elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research fills this knowledge gap by focusing on female-female aggression, a behavior that is widespread and beneficial in the animal kingdom, but poorly understood. This research will experimentally test how individual differences in aggression arise at the level of the brain. In addition, experiments and comparative analyses will explore whether the physiological and environmental drivers of aggression are conserved or unique across multiple species. These efforts will yield quantitative models on the origin of behavioral variation, including perspectives that connect multiple levels of biological complexity, from genes to the environment and from individuals to species. This research is coupled with an educational plan that injects writing into research-based curricula in animal behavior. Activities include writing exercises and training that will improve scientific comprehension, critical thinking and communication in undergraduate and graduate students. Freshmen and sophomores will also be guided through the full scientific process through a new writing intensive course-based research program using data collected here. These activities will generate lasting institutional programs for improved research and scientific education. By removing poor writing as a barrier to success, these activities will attract and retain diverse scientists, generating a better prepared workforce in animal behavior and allied biological disciplines. Dissemination of results to community groups and schools will further amplify these goals, improving science literacy and knowledge of animal behavior for the general public and specialists alike.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to integrate mechanistic and functional perspectives on within- and among-species variation in female aggression to unveil how behavioral evolution unfolds. By contrasting neurogenomic responses to aggression at both individual and species levels, new data will reveal how the mechanisms generating behavioral variation are conserved across levels of biological organization. Together with phylogenetic analyses on the evolutionary drivers of female aggression across >30 species, this research will systematically test the degree of parallelism (or lack thereof) in behavioral evolution, including both functional and mechanistic perspectives. Earlier efforts to understand competitive traits in females have met with limited success, but the hypotheses tested previously were derived from research on male animals. Considering that female birds are the initial dispersers and therefore front-line responders to new environmental challenges, the studies on females are especially critical. The integrated research and educational plan offers an extraordinary opportunity to link function and mechanism of behavior over evolutionary time, while also changing the culture of scientific training in ways that feed back to advances in animal behavior and allied STEM fields. The writing-research activities directed at multiple levels in higher education will better prepare the future STEM workforce. Through the mentorship of undergrad, grad, and postdoctoral trainees, and new partnerships with a writing intensive course-based research experience, this grant facilitates exceptional training in integrative behavioral research and establishes self-sustaining programs that will generate advances at the interface of behavior, evolution, and genomics.

The Urban Heat Island is the most well-known consequence of cities, but prior research on precipitation and lightning has provided an indication that cities can also affect the location and strength of thunderstorms.  This award provides funding for a numerical modeling study of the potential for urban storm modification with a specific focus on severe weather potential.  The intent of the study is to determine which storm processes  are most affected by an urban area and which urban features are most likely to modify significant storms.  The output from this work will provide operational forecasters with additional information relevant to public safety.  The award will also help to train the next generation of scientists through support of students and the development of learning modules for K-12 teachers.<br/><br/>This project intends to improve the understanding of interactions between deep convective storms and large urban areas.  Most prior research in the area of storm-urban interactions has focused on weakly-forced events and/or the resultant precipitation from those storms, and the community has not coalesced around the dominant mechanism for storm modification (Urban Heat Island (UHI), flow obstruction, aerosols, moisture).  This study will consist of a large parameter space study to investigate the cause-and-effect relationship between urban parameters and storm modification.  The first step will be a CM1-based set of ~150 idealized sensitivity experiments, with grid sizes <250m.  The WRF-ARW would then be used to examine instances of storm modification in real-data cases around Louisville, KY using a 10-member ensemble approach.  The UHI will be adjusted by assimilating data from a network of 30 observation sites around the city.  Finally, the observational network will be used to analyze the spatial variability in convective rainfall amounts.  The overarching questions that the proposal would address are:  1) Which in-storm processes are most strongly affected by an encounter with a large urban area?, 2) What are the consequences of city-storm interactions as they relate to severe weather potential?, 3) How do different urban features impact the modification of deep convective storms?, and 4) What is the effect of environmental wind shear on urban modification?<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Physical and Dynamic Meteorology program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference falls on the 100 year anniversary of Ramanujan's original definition in his deathbed letter to Hardy and will take place at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee on May 18-19 2020. The main theme will be on new developments around the area of partitions, and especially ranks, cranks, and other partition statistics. This conference is oriented at establishing and furthering dialogue on new developments at the boundary of combinatorics and modular forms. This will foster collaboration between researchers working in these fields, and the conference will feature a problem session to delineate and disseminate critical questions, as well as a discussion panel about issues affecting junior and minority researchers. <br/><br/>In particular, modular forms and mock modular forms have long been essential tools in the study partitions and other combinatorial sequences.  Mock theta functions have led to many results on rank and crank congruences, asymptotics, and inequalities, and conversely, such partition statistics have motivated the development of harmonic Maass forms.  Very recently, Stanton has highlighted several conjectures of his and Garvan's in unpublished notes.  These conjectures seek a combinatorial refinement of the rank and crank statistics. These suggest a deeper structure both on the combinatorial side and in the mock modular form world. These conjectures have the potential to open up new areas of research at the intersection of combinatorics and mock theta functions. Given these cutting-edge questions and the fitting nature of Ramanujan's anniversary of introducing mock theta functions, it is a particularly opportune time to gather experts from these two fields to discuss the future of such questions and related topics, and to involve the next generation of junior researchers in this conversation and collaboration.

Smart home sensors and smartphones are examples of things used in the era of smart cities, each creating a tremendous amount of data that needs to be processed. Edge computing is an emerging technology used to process such large amounts of data in real-time. Edge computing also poses new resource management challenges due to its limited capacity. This project focuses on optimization of resource management in edge and cloud computing frameworks.<br/><br/>This project proposes to use concepts of federated learning and reinforcement learning to provide optimal solutions for service placement and request scheduling in multi-tier edge and cloud computing frameworks. This project will focus on new algorithms and system design technologies to trade off the quality-of-service (QoS) and the cost in edge computing systems. Three main thrusts include: 1) finding theoretical bounds through mathematical formulation and algorithm design, 2) finding more practical and adaptive solutions through multi-agent reinforcement learning and the federated learning framework, and 3) comparison of practical solutions with theoretical bounds through numerical analysis and implementations on a mobile edge computing test-bed. <br/><br/>This project will have impacts on the future IoT and smart cities applications by improving the cost of providing such applications while maintaining certain QoS levels for users. Algorithms and an optimization framework developed in this project will contribute to the research in design and development of scalable and reliable edge computing systems as building blocks of IoT applications.

This project uses zooarchaeology, the study of archaeological animal remains, to evaluate the impact of Spanish colonialism on households. Building on previous site-level investigations, this study considers continuities and transformations in the access to animal resources by specific community members as they adapted to the new Colonial order. Zooarchaeology is well placed to study periods of culture contact because animals can serve not only as basic resources, but also as indicators of cultural identity, luxury items, and symbols of status and power display. Thus, their material remains in the archaeological record provide a proxy of the past economic, social, and political systems in which they were used. In this study, the application of innovative zooarchaeological techniques provides a refined view of animal use by householders of different social status and political authority through the period of Spanish contact. In turn, this offers insight into the role played by status and political standing in how people react and adapt to times of instability. The project also incorporates methodological advancements by (1) presenting a new method combining taphonomy (the study of post-depositional histories of archaeological remains), skeletal element refitting, and radiocarbon dating to resolve issues of poor stratigraphic and chronological resolution; and (2) using a multi-isotope approach to investigate animal trade and management practices from pre-Columbian to Colonial times. Through museum exhibits and academic and public talks this project will generate discussions on the retention and loss of indigenous political economy in marginal areas. This research project will also train undergraduate students in methods of identification and analysis of zooarchaeological remains through hands-on lab activities. <br/><br/>To document change or persistence in cultural practices in marginal communities under Spanish rule, zooarchaeological remains are studied in two steps. First, taphonomic, refitting, and radiocarbon data are used to refine the chronology of deposits from seven households. Second, differences in the access to and control over animal resources and related activities are identified by comparing taxonomic, skeletal, and isotopic data among contexts (elite vs. non-elite, ruler vs. ruled) and periods (pre-Columbian vs. Colonial). Together, these lines of evidence will allow one to determine (1) if the elite maintained their status and power by retaining access to valued animal resources; and (2) if non-elite community members developed new strategies of animal exploitation to adapt to the Colonial order. Overall, these analyses will document relations of production and distribution of animal resources in Spanish borderlands and assess the impact of Spanish colonialism on the pursuit of these activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As humans reshape the global environment, a critical component of effective conservation strategies is understanding and predicting how plants and animals will respond to human landscape alterations. Plants and animals in urban environments can evolve rapidly, indicating that some species may be able to thrive in close proximity to humans. Small agricultural villages have persisted for over 12,000 years; species that successfully inhabit these environments offer a unique window into the long-term effects of human activity on evolutionary processes. Oceanic swallows build their nests on human structures and forage over agricultural fields. The spread of rural environments has thus created extensive new habitat for these species. This project will rigorously test hypotheses about the role of human landscape modification in shaping the evolutionary history of Oceanic swallows over the last 10,000 years. This novel approach is broadly applicable to other species and will shed new light on how species respond and adapt to human environments. The project is based at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and will involve extensive research experiences for undergraduate students. It also includes the development of a hands-on, high school- level teaching module on urban evolution.<br/><br/>This project will leverage extensive new geographic sampling, museum specimens, large geospatial datasets, and cutting-edge genomic approaches to examine how swallows have adapted to living in close proximity to humans (human commensalism). As different Oceanic swallow lineages have been commensal for different lengths of time, it is possible to examine the origins and spread of commensalism across multiple temporal scales and within a comparative framework comprised of two commensal and two non-commensal lineages. One lineage of each type has had an extended association with humans, and the others have had more recent association. This project will 1) use species distribution modeling to assess the relative roles of climate variation and post-Neolithic human landscape modification in shaping demographic history, particularly range expansions and population divergence; 2) use high-resolution whole-genome sequence data to determine whether commensal behavior arose via phenotypic plasticity, evolved independently among lineages, or spread via introgression from a single origin; and 3) evaluate evidence for contemporary human-mediated hybridization and erosion of reproductive barriers between previously allopatric groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without effective adaptation, lifelong robots will inevitably fail, jeopardizing both their missions and surrounding environments. Change and novelty are two of the greatest challenges that prevent robots from achieving lifelong adaptation. The goal of this award is to develop and gain a fundamental understanding of a novel paradigm, called robot reflection, to address change and novelty in order to achieve lifelong robot adaptation. Inspired by theories of cognitive reflection for human adaptation, the proposed robot reflection paradigm will allow a robot to reason about itself and adjust its own adaptation process without requiring human supervision. This award stands to provide significant benefit to society by enabling robots that reflect to improve performance over their lifetimes, thus broadly impacting lifelong robotics applications in which robots must operate over long periods of time, such as search and rescue and autonomous driving.<br/><br/>To produce algorithms for robot reflection in lifelong adaptation, the technical aims of this award are divided into three thrusts. The first thrust enables self-aware robot adaptation in context, through a principled method that offsets a robot perception and decision making model according to combinations of changes in the environment and the robot itself. The second thrust addresses adapting robot adaptation according to the degree of novelty in the robot's experiences, through a novelty estimation approach that compares the current experiences against past episodes in the robot's memory to estimate novelty, and a machine forgetting method to update the robot's fixed-capacity memory by adaptively selecting past episodes to forget while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The third thrust focuses on robot adaptation by imagination without requiring a robot to physically experience a new scenario, through a novel approach that formulates robot imagination as sequential decision making and explores interpretable methods for modeling the underlying relationships between experienced and new scenarios for data-efficient imagination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, molecular clocks are present in most peripheral tissues, where they serve tissue-specific functions. Together, these make up an extended clock network that synchronizes behavioral and physiological processes with the external environment and organizes them with respect to one another. For example, the circadian system generates rhythms in feeding behaviors such that feeding occurs at optimal times of day, and concurrently upregulates metabolic pathways in anticipation of increased food intake. Proper circadian organization is essential for organismal fitness, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which circadian rhythms are generated and integrated across multiple clock-containing tissues are unknown. To that end, experiments outlined in this project will use the powerful model organism of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to identify neuronal pathways through which clock cells establish circadian rhythms of feeding behavior and to further delineate how feeding rhythms are coordinated with peripheral metabolic rhythms. These experiments will be conducted in collaboration with postdoctoral and undergraduate researchers in the lab who will also serve as mentors for a summer high school internship program that will expand participation to groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>An understanding of the manner through which the circadian system modulates behavioral outputs and coordinates these with physiological rhythms requires analysis of novel circadian endpoints in addition to rest and activity, which has thus far been the focus of most circadian research. Objective 1 will use a newly-developed feeding monitor to determine the cellular logic through which the central clock regulates feeding rhythms. To determine whether distinct central clock mechanisms control feeding and locomotor activity rhythms, period and strength of feeding rhythms will be measured following genetic manipulations that alter molecular clock function or neuronal activity in discrete clock cell populations. Objective 2 will investigate downstream output pathways through which feeding rhythms are produced. To enact behavioral rhythms, circadian information must be transmitted across output pathways to brain areas that regulate behaviors. The Cavanaugh laboratory recently implicated SIFa peptide-expressing neurons as a component of the circadian output pathway controlling feeding. To continue to trace the circadian feeding circuit, an RNA interference-based behavioral screen will be conducted to identify cells in which the SIFa receptor must be present for normal feeding rhythms. Finally, Objective 3 will investigate how feeding and metabolic rhythms are coordinated by the clock network. The fat body is a peripheral clock tissue that serves metabolic functions. A combined transcriptomic and metabolomic approach will be employed to determine how loss of SIFa signaling or selective molecular clock abrogation in the brain or fat body affects fat body gene oscillations and whole-animal metabolite abundance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has strong implications for our understanding of earthquakes and associated hazards. Earthquakes occur periodically; their recurrence is due to the ""stick-slip"" behavior of large fractures in the Earth?s crust, called faults. A fault ""sticks"" in the time periods between earthquakes and ""slips"" during earthquakes. The stick-slip motion arises from the interaction of the elastic (spring-like) behavior of relatively cold rocks and the frictional behavior of faults. Rock friction has been extensively studied in the laboratory because of its relevance to earthquakes. Empirical equations ? that is, derived from experimental data rather than based on known mechanisms ? describe how friction varies with time and sliding velocity. Computer models use these equations to reproduce a wide range of earthquake-related phenomena. However, the physical and/or chemical processes underlying these equations are still largely unknown; identifying and quantifying them is critical for applying laboratory results to geological faults. Here, the research team investigates these processes at the microscale and nanoscale of the asperities (bumps) on the fault surface where fault rocks are in actual contact. They use atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation to mimic the behavior of single asperities and to measure their behavior at small scales. Feeding the results of experiments into computer simulations that incorporate larger scales,  they model and predict the frictional behaviors of rock surfaces. Ultimately, the researchers aim to develop new equations that better capture the behavior of earthquake faults and improve hazard assessment. This project also provides support to two graduate students and a postdoctoral associate. It fosters training for undergraduate students and outreach to high-school students and teachers, notably from underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>Empirical rate-and-state friction laws, which describe the frictional sliding behavior of faults, are commonly used in earthquake models. Their physical basis is largely unknown, particularly for the equations that describe the evolution of the ""state"" of a frictional interface. This renders the extrapolation of laboratory results to geological faults fraught with uncertainty. A common explanation of frictional ""state"" is that it represents the true area of contact on a fault surface; this area evolves (increases) with time or slip due to asperity yielding and creep. An emerging alternative is that contacts strengthen due to chemical bonding at contact junctions. The team previously demonstrated ? using single-asperity atomic force microscopy and coordinated with computer simulations, and with nanoindentation experiments - that both mechanisms may contribute to the increase of friction with time (or slip), an effect termed frictional aging.  A unifying hypothesis is that asperity creep and chemical bonding occur simultaneously at asperity contacts, but that aging is due primarily to chemical bonding. In this scenario, contact area and chemical bonding are inextricably linked, with asperity yielding and creep providing the contact area upon which chemical bonding occurs. Here, the research team will conduct novel experiments and simulations at the nexus of geophysics, chemistry, materials science, and mechanics to unveil the physical basis for rate-and-state friction. Specifically, they seek to 1) elucidate the roles of yielding and creep of asperities in friction, 2) explore the influences of temperature and fluid chemistry on surface aging and 3) elucidate the roles of slip versus time in state evolution. They employ specimens made of silica and quartz and, for the first time, amorphous alumina, sapphire and feldspar. Results from single-asperity experiments are integrated into simulations which describe the behavior of rough rock surfaces in contact via multiscale modeling. The models incorporate asperity yielding and creep with chemical bonding effects for the first time, allowing new insights into rate-and-state friction behavior of rock surfaces and faults. This project may lead to a paradigm shift with transformative implications for understanding earthquake nucleation, and for the assessment of earthquake hazards and associated risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological adaptations involved in wasp, honeybee, mosquito, and sand lance substrate penetration, earth and marine worm locomotion, caecilian and clam burrowing, and root growth will be explored. This project will integrate bioinspired design, laboratory experiments, discrete element modeling simulations, and centrifuge models. The fundamental mechanical processes that facilitate bioinspired soil penetration will be investigated, including soil arching, principal stress rotation, interactions between zones with altered stress states, load transfer and its dependency on shape, and softening caused by pore fluid pressurization. The education and outreach efforts will be targeted towards middle school and high school students through youth citizen science activities and towards undergraduate and graduate students through training in the classroom and the laboratory.

With its ability to study long spans of time, archaeology is uniquely positioned to study, as in a laboratory, the impact of these two crucial variables on human societies. In doing so, this research helps determine if environmental change, including both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, or human population density individually are sufficient to produce change in human behavior, or if the greatest change is produced by their  combined effect. Given that world population will reach 11 billion by AD 2100, and on-going environmental changes, planning for the future should make use of the best laboratory available, deep human and environmental history. Three graduate students will assist in this analysis and use the site?s data for their dissertations. Continuing a long tradition, Kelly will use the site?s analysis in public lectures to discuss the impact of environment and population on human behavior.<br/><br/>The project employs existing data, e.g., pollen cores from nearby lakes and a regional database of radiocarbon dates, to reconstruct environment and regional human population. The project?s main contribution is analysis of evidence of human behavioral change based on data recovered from an archaeological site, Alm Shelter, recently excavated by Kelly and his team in Wyoming?s Bighorn Mountains. Alm Shelter provides a 12,000-year record of human use, and, lying beneath an overhanging cliff, is dry and thus provides excellent preservation of organic materials. Often, the layers of earth that comprise a site have been disturbed, with artifacts moved about by burrowing animals or human activities such as digging pits. Thinking of an archaeological site as a book that one reads from the bottom up, such disturbances move paragraphs ? artifacts and bones ? from one chapter to another, making the book difficult to read. But that is not the case at Alm Shelter; this site?s layers are intact and accumulated at a slow rate that remained constant over time. This permits a unique analysis. Archaeologists use a statistical method known as an ?age-depth model? to assign an age-range to artifacts based on their depth. Given this site?s careful excavation, a tight age-range can be assigned to literally every single artifact, bone, and other item recovered from the site. This allows a new analytical approach, one where the changing abundances of artifacts and other remains can be examined as distributions of age-ranges. These distributions can then be statistically analyzed to determine when different kinds of artifacts, such as projectile points, or different kinds of animal remains are changing in sync and how those changes relate to the known environmental and human population changes of the region?s past. Using artifacts, and discarded plant and animal remains as evidence of past human behavior, this analysis provides a way to examine how behavior changed in relation to environmental changes and human population density.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent years have witnessed an explosion in research on building synthetic cells, not only as a way to study the origins and the rules of life, but also as a new approach to biochemical engineering to increase the yield in making molecules. Nevertheless, current synthetic cell research has neglected one of the most fundamental properties of living matter ? the ability to self-repair following damage. Living cells are generally soft and easily damaged, yet a number of them can repair themselves after being mechanically punctured, torn, or even ripped in half. If one could construct such self-repairing capability in synthetic cells, it should be possible to gain insights into one of the defining features of cells. At the same time, it could open new realms of biochemical engineering by allowing the synthetic cell systems to operate robustly under the potentially harsh environment of industrial processes. One approach to attaining self-repairing synthetic cells is to adapt self-repair mechanisms from a living system which already demonstrates robust capacity to heal from large mechanical wounds within a single cell, and build analogs of these mechanisms inside synthetic cells. One such system is Stentor coeruleus, a single-celled free-living ciliate, which possess a more robust wound healing capacity than most other cells. However, the self-repair mechanisms of Stentor are largely unknown. The overall goal of this proposal, therefore, is to understand the mechanisms by which Stentor cells can heal robustly from large mechanical wounds. The results of this work will lead to fundamental insights into wound healing, one of the defining features of life. It will also lay the foundation for constructing self-repairing synthetic cells. The collaboration between the researchers will provide a unique opportunity for training and workforce development at the interface of cell biology and engineering. A website on ?superhero cells and bugs? will be created to raise public interest in non-model organisms possessing ?superpowers? such as self-healing and survival in space. The researchers will continue their efforts to recruit underrepresented minorities to science and engineering via social media, outreach activities targeted to K-12 students, and their active participation in the Bay Area Science Festival and the Maker Faire.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to understand at a physical and molecular level how Stentor coeruleus cells can heal robustly from large mechanical wounds that cause an opening in the plasma membrane. The key biological questions probed include: What sets the limit of the biggest wound the cell can recover from? Does the large size of the cell facilitate its wound healing, or has wound healing evolved to be particularly rapid in this cell? The rationale to focus on Stentor are: 1) its wound healing capacity is more robust than most other cells, capable of recovering from drastic wounds and regenerating from cell fragments as small as 1/27th of original cell size in 24 hours. 2) The ability to perform high-throughput gene knockdown and wounding experiments. The research objectives are to: 1) Develop a minimalistic whole-cell mathematical model of single-cell wound healing. 2) Test predictions of the model by measuring the kinetics of healing in cells as a function of wound size and cell size. 3) Identify contributions to the healing process from membrane patching, purse-string constriction, or other mechanisms as identified by phosphoproteomics. The intellectual merit of this research lies in the identification of the principles for repairing large mechanical wounds in a single cell, and the conditions at which the healing process will succeed or fail. Fundamentally, the ability to heal is one of the key features that distinguish living matter from non-living matter. This study will shed light into the problem of how some biological systems can heal more robustly than others. Practically, the work will lay the foundation for engineering a new function?self-repair?in synthetic cells, and will make the technology more robust for potential scale-up for practical industrial applications.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function and Systems and Synthetic Biology clusters of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will bring together faculty from research universities, liberal arts colleges, community and two-year colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Speakers who identify as members of traditionally underrepresented groups as well as professionals from two- and four- year colleges will provide diverse representation across all of the organizing committees for the 2020 forum. Importantly, there will be group discussions on critical developments in structural geology and tectonics, and what future research priorities should be. This community building effort will help create a stronger, more vibrant group of scientists and help introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates to the structural geology and tectonics disciplines. The setting will be particularly useful for graduate students, who will be able to use the venue and informal nature of the forum to find out what research is taking place at other institutions, meet a wide range of faculty, and develop useful contacts which will be of great value to their future careers. Informal mentoring sessions will facilitate opportunities for early career professionals and students in navigating careers in structural geology and tectonics. Students will present their own work in a friendly environment where they can obtain thoughtful and useful feedback, as well as providing opportunity to build new scientific collaborations. An important contribution of this forum will include a session aimed identifying one session will be aimed at best practices to promote equity, diversity and inclusion in the classroom. By focusing on classroom activities and approaches, successful strategies can be identified that can be adopted by other institutions to minimize the ?leaky pipeline? that is known to be part of the problem with retention of underrepresented groups in the geosciences. Abstracts, field guides, and short course notes will be disseminated through a dedicated website that will be publicly accessible. Continued support for the Structural Geology and Tectonics Forum contributes to the long-term health, vitality, and infrastructure of the Earth Science community.

It is no surprise, therefore, that the skull has fascinated researchers across the entirety of Biology over the past century. In more recent decades, understanding the developmental bases of craniofacial diversity has been a major goal of Evolutionary-developmental biology. However, a paucity of experimental systems among amniotes ? reptiles, birds, and mammals ? has made it difficult to create a synthetic understanding of how developmental patterning has changed during the remarkable diversification in skull form. In this research Dr. Sanger will dissect skull development in an emerging model lizard, Anolis sagrei. Sanger and his team will investigate the expression and function of three core signaling pathways known to be involved in skull development in other amniote species. Through this research they will discover whether the diversity in skull form is due to minor or major changes in craniofacial patterning. Capitalizing on the inherent interest in the vertebrate skull, Sanger will also team with a group of professional educators to develop ""Getting Ahead in Life: Investigations into the Vertebrate Skull"", cutting-edge, transdisciplinary learning modules targeted to upper level high school and undergraduate biology. Embedded within these modules will be interviews and real-world data from leaders in the field of craniofacial biology, especially people from groups underrepresented in STEM. Together, Sanger?s efforts will significantly advance the field of craniofacial development and help motivate the next generation of students to pursue education in STEM fields.<br/><br/>One of the most morphologically and developmentally complex anatomical systems is the vertebrate skull. Although there is coarse similarity in cranial embryology among these groups, there is growing, yet disparate, evidence to suggest that cranial patterning has evolved over both small and large evolutionary scales. To date, however, our understanding of facial development has primarily arisen from only a few experimentally accessible avian and mammalian species, making it difficult to make broad generalizations about the evolution of cranial development. Uncovering the function of key patterning genes in previously undescribed clades is a critical step towards polarizing the evolution of cranial patterning mechanisms and to help elucidate the ancestral character state of amniotes. In this research Sanger and his team will investigate the expression and function of three core signalizing pathways involved in craniofacial development: Hedgehog, Fibroblast growth Factor, and Bone morphogenetic protein. This team will use new tools to manipulate the expression of these pathways in embryos of Anolis sagrei, an emerging model system in Developmental Biology, but a historically important species in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. With this baseline information in hand, Sanger will turn towards evolutionary patterns of skull diversity on a smaller scale, among Anolis lizards. Anolis lizards vary extensively in their facial length. Multiple lineages have independently converged on short-faced and long-faced morphologies. Sanger and his team will also determine the developmental bases of these convergent phenotypes. Combined, this research will determine how the processes regulating craniofacial development evolve over different evolutionary time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on understanding and controlling processes in electrode materials that can allow for greater storage capacities but typically suffer from severe degradation due to changes in their solid-state structures. Most of the research, which involves both experimental and computational approaches, is designed to promote or suppress the solid-state phase change of the electrode by depositing a coating layer to impose chemical and mechanical constraints. The specific findings from this project, especially on suppressing the phase change, will enable low-cost, abundant, cobalt-free, high-capacity conversion electrodes with long cycle life for lithium-based batteries that are used in a variety of applications. The scientific advancement will stimulate the broader materials research community to explore the influence of interfacial controls on phase competition for many materials systems. Knowledge transfer is occurring through both public dissemination and direct interactions with industrial and national lab partners through the PIs? research network. Furthermore, these research activities serve as an educational platform for students at all levels and from different backgrounds to develop interdisciplinary expertise by directly experiencing both computational and experimental methods through this collaborative research. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS:  Pursuing both high lithium storage capacity and reversibility is a dilemma but also a crucial need as the renewable energy future, from electric vehicles to renewable power, strongly depends on Li-ion energy storage technology.  This project will explore a new design principle to extend reversible intercalation reactions to higher lithium capacity by using surface modification and conformal coatings to suppress the irreversible solid-state phase transformations. Efforts at Michigan State University focus on developing a Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based multiscale modeling method to accurately predict phase evolution in the coated electrode. Efforts at University of Maryland will precisely control the surface layer with atomic layer deposition (ALD) to vary its chemistry, modulus, and thickness and perform electrochemical characterization. The collaborative efforts will determine atomistic origins of the competition between conversion and intercalation reactions during lithiation of conversion cathode materials and determine the coupled chemical-mechanical effect of the nanoscale coating layer on the competition of the two reactions.

Many of these speakers are heritage speakers of Spanish: English bilingual speakers who are raised in homes where Spanish is spoken. Past studies have characterized grammatical knowledge in the heritage language as deficient relative to grammatical knowledge in monolingual speakers of Spanish. The goal of this dissertation project is to move away from this perspective in order to better understand the grammars of heritage speakers of Spanish in the U.S. Why is this important? The home language of heritage speakers is often stigmatized. However, ample evidence suggests that maintaining the home language is important because it is the most linguistically-developed parental language and provides the best foundation for learning both a home language and a societal language. Therefore, the study of heritage languages contributes to the validation of language practices that are commonly looked down upon by the general public and the academic community.<br/><br/>The planned study examines a grammatical feature of Spanish that has been argued to be misused and simplified, and to display so-called ""erosion"" by heritage speakers of Spanish: the Spanish subjunctive. Unlike past research that has relied on prescriptive notions of what is grammatically ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" in the use of the Spanish subjunctive, the experimental materials employed here will mirror spontaneously produced speech extracted from a large corpus. Two questions are addressed: (1) To what degree are heritage speakers who live in a long-standing bilingual community sensitive to the linguistic factors (lexical and structural) constraining the selection of the Spanish subjunctive?, and (2) To what degree do social factors modulate heritage speakers? sensitivity to mood selection? Data will be collected using auditory pupillometry, and changes in pupil dilation will be used an as an index of processing difficulty. Pupillometry was selected as the method of data collection because of its high ecological validity in the context of heritage speakers, whose language experience in the heritage language is mostly oral and aural. By using an appropriate methodology and by incorporating corpus data in the design of the planned experiments, the goal is to contribute to a theory of language acquisition and processing in heritage language contexts with greater explanatory adequacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the centuries- or millennia-long time scales necessary to evaluate true long-term sustainability are often inaccessible through contemporary ecological datasets. The deep-time cultural and environmental datasets analyzed by archaeologists therefore offer a unique window into understanding sustainable agricultural practices across millennia, allowing researchers insight into both the social and environmental factors that contribute to (or inhibit) the longevity of productive agro-ecosystems systems. This project will apply a multidisciplinary archaeological and ecological approach to investigate 800+ years of indigenous agricultural activities in a windward Hawaiian Valley (Hal?wa Valley, Moloka?i Island) and evaluate its long-term productivity and sustainability. It will provide new insight into the establishment and growth of intensive agricultural systems, including the impacts of agriculture on local soils, water use, and vegetation, as well as the ways past people adapted to climatic fluctuations and resource limitations. As a community-based participatory research project, researchers will work in collaboration with local community members and non-profit organizations to facilitate archaeology and heritage management training opportunities for local stakeholders, and to apply research results towards ecosystem restoration and sustainable agriculture on Moloka?i. This research will also offer STEM training opportunities for Native Hawaiians and other underrepresented stakeholders in field, laboratory, and museum settings. <br/><br/>This project will combine re-analysis of previously excavated archaeological collections with renewed field survey and excavations in Hal?wa Valley to test the hypothesis that intensive wet-valley Hawaiian agro-ecosystems were not only highly productive, but sustainable across centuries of agricultural activities. This research will address six primary objectives: (1) archaeological survey and mapping, targeted excavation, and new high-precision radiocarbon dating will be applied to document the development of irrigated agriculture and water flow control mechanisms. (2) GIS mapping, soil, and microbotanical analyses will be applied to investigate the nature and extent of colluvial slope agriculture within the valley, an under-researched but likely critical component of food production in Hal?wa Valley. (3) Chemical analyses of soil samples will characterize soil fertility across the valley and examine the impacts of centuries of agriculture on soil nutrient availability. (4) Analysis of archival records will investigate early post-contact land use and water rights to characterize the past social and political context of agricultural systems in Hal?wa. (5) Analysis of archaeological faunal remains will examine the development of animal husbandry and its integration into food production and resource allocation decisions. Stable isotope analysis of pig, dog, and rat remains will examine changes to food webs and nutrient flows across agro-ecosystems to evaluate changing land use and sustainability.

A strong foreign accent, a distinct dialect, or even a stuffy nose can impact the precise realization of speech. Human speech perception is remarkably flexible. Although comprehension initially suffers when speech departs from the norms of a listener?s language-community, with exposure listeners rapidly adapt and comprehension rebounds. Understanding the means by which the human brain is able to flexibly map speech to language representations promises to be important in advancing next generation linguistic theories, in building more robust machine speech recognition, and in supporting individuals communicating in non-native educational contexts. <br/><br/>This dissertation research project will simulate an accent by manipulating short-term speech input regularities to determine how speech perception adapts. This offers the advantage of providing a detailed measure of how the weighting of specific acoustic speech dimensions shifts as a function of short-term speech input changes such as accent. The central hypothesis of the research, supported by preliminary studies, is that adaptive plasticity in speech communication is driven by error-driven supervised learning. Study 1 tests a prediction arising from this hypothesis: when short-term speech input regularities depart from long-term norms, supervised error-driven learning supported by phonetic category activation will result in down-weighting of secondary acoustic dimensions available for speech recognition. Study 2 pursues this prediction via a neural network that implements the algorithmic theory. Study 3 addresses whether overt phonetic category decisions are necessary for adaptive plasticity in a naturalistic listening environment without overt phonetic category decisions. Finally, Study 4 uses scalp electrophysiology to examine the level of linguistic representation impacted by adaptive plasticity in dimension-based statistical learning. In all, the project will advance understanding of how the linguistic system tackles the challenge of communication when speech input deviates from the long-term norms that established linguistic representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the centrality of the activity, however, little is understood about the general principles involved in each step of the process, making it difficult to design better ways to help people ask questions and find the information they need. The problem becomes even more pressing in the information age: people ask more questions than ever before, on a wider range of topics, and they take those questions not only to friends and family, but also to strangers and acquaintances on the wider world of online bulletin boards and social media. This dissertation work addresses gaps in our understanding, using a combination of methods from psychology and computer science. Tools from machine learning and artificial intelligence will be used to analyze large-scale collections of questions and answers that people produce on online bulletin board systems and results will be used to build general theories that explain and predict how and when people find good answers to their questions. In laboratory experiments to test these theories, participants will be shown questions and answers with varying underlying properties, and the results will identify features that are particularly crucial for information gathering. The large-scale nature of the data science investigation affords the development of theories based on subtle patterns in the relationship between question and answer, while the laboratory work allows investigation into the causal nature of the problem: what, for the question-asker, makes an answer good?<br/><br/>One of the most common ways people explore and learn about the world is by seeking information from others through asking questions. This behavior requires two kinds of judgments: (1) from whom one should seek answers and (2) how should one judge whether the answer satisfies the question? These two judgments are inter-dependent and require that people make decisions under uncertainty. This two-pronged investigation into how such judgments are made includes not only the lab-based experiments that are a traditional strength of social and decision sciences, but also a data science component that looks at how these decisions are made in the wild. This mix of methodologies will be used to examine the defining features of good answers and those who give them. The research focuses on questions and answers that are given in human-to-human linguistic dialogue. Techniques from data science and computational linguistics will be used to analyze collections of questions and answers produced on online discussion forums, ranging from requests for technical help on Stackexchange to more nuanced, social questions asked by parents on Mumsnet. Two key properties of the relationship between questions and answers?the extent to which they overlap, and the degree to which answers focus the solution space posed by the question?are hypothesized to correspond to how answers are evaluated. Controlled laboratory experiments will be used to elucidate preferences for those who answer questions. The types of preferences a questioner has for potential answerers has direct consequences for the relevance and quality of information received, and in turn affects the utility of subsequent answers and further decisions. A Bayesian framework is used to formalize the task facing the questioner: to infer what type of answerer an individual is, given their past answering behavior. Behavioral experiments will test key predictions of the model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on understanding and controlling processes in electrode materials that can allow for greater storage capacities but typically suffer from severe degradation due to changes in their solid-state structures. Most of the research, which involves both experimental and computational approaches, is designed to promote or suppress the solid-state phase change of the electrode by depositing a coating layer to impose chemical and mechanical constraints. The specific findings from this project, especially on suppressing the phase change, will enable low-cost, abundant, cobalt-free, high-capacity conversion electrodes with long cycle life for lithium-based batteries that are used in a variety of applications. The scientific advancement will stimulate the broader materials research community to explore the influence of interfacial controls on phase competition for many materials systems. Knowledge transfer is occurring through both public dissemination and direct interactions with industrial and national lab partners through the PIs? research network. Furthermore, these research activities serve as an educational platform for students at all levels and from different backgrounds to develop interdisciplinary expertise by directly experiencing both computational and experimental methods through this collaborative research. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS:  Pursuing both high lithium storage capacity and reversibility is a dilemma but also a crucial need as the renewable energy future, from electric vehicles to renewable power, strongly depends on Li-ion energy storage technology.  This project will explore a new design principle to extend reversible intercalation reactions to higher lithium capacity by using surface modification and conformal coatings to suppress the irreversible solid-state phase transformations. Efforts at Michigan State University focus on developing a Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based multiscale modeling method to accurately predict phase evolution in the coated electrode. Efforts at University of Maryland will precisely control the surface layer with atomic layer deposition (ALD) to vary its chemistry, modulus, and thickness and perform electrochemical characterization. The collaborative efforts will determine atomistic origins of the competition between conversion and intercalation reactions during lithiation of conversion cathode materials and determine the coupled chemical-mechanical effect of the nanoscale coating layer on the competition of the two reactions. The scientific impact of this project goes beyond improved life and performance of conversion-type materials to the fundamental opportunity to understand how a material?s bulk reactions can be modulated through carefully designed interfacial control layers.

Many basic aspects of the biology of these cells that would allow scientists to more effectively deal with neural dysfunction and disease is still not understood.  The research project will identify the mechanisms of neurogenesis during development and regeneration in a species of sea anemone capable of regenerating its nerve cells, and that is particularly well-suited for state-of-the-art experimental manipulations that would be much more difficult to perform and evaluate in other animals. Because scientists have previously studied a very small number of animal species that undergo development and regeneration, studies in novel animals such as Nematostella are necessary in order to understand the full range of developmental mechanisms that can be used to regulate neurogenesis and promote regeneration, as well as to better understand how alterations to developmental mechanisms contributed to nervous system evolution. The outcomes of this work will improve our fundamental understanding of neurogenesis, and potentially guide future efforts to improve regenerative therapies. The project will also broadly impact STEM students by engaging undergraduates in an advanced lab course where they will conduct cutting-edge research testing hypotheses related to the goals of this project. The focus of the lab is to teach students how to acquire and integrate new knowledge that improves their understanding of scientific questions. The course increases both their scientific literacy and critical reasoning skills, better preparing them for careers in a wide range of STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project investigates mechanisms of neuronal induction and neuronal subtype patterning during developmental and regenerative neurogenesis in the cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella. The approach combines gene expression analysis, gene specific functional disruptions, and RNA sequencing to identify mechanisms that neuralize nave cells and integrate spatial cues to generate specific neuronal subtypes during development and regeneration. The choice of Nematostella as a model is driven in part by the fact that it is one of few animals that allow for direct comparisons between both developmental and regenerative programs in the same species, and that as a cnidarian it will allow researchers to infer the ancestral state from which centralized nervous systems evolved. The results of these studies will enable investigators to begin generating and comparing models of the gene regulatory networks that are responsible for the neurogenesis of specific cell subtypes during both development and regeneration. Additionally, the data set on developmental regulatory networks will allow scientists to better test hypotheses about the origin and evolution of complex centralized nervous systems. The main outcomes of this work will be a more complete view of the degree to which developmental and regenerative neurogenesis overlap, and the first comprehensive data set describing neurogenesis in non-bilaterian animals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This data is expected to help resolve some of the large uncertainties in the formation of oxidized VOCs in fire plumes. In particular, the emissions of fire-related formic acid (HCOOH) are especially uncertain in Australian fires. Atmospheric HCOOH contributes to precipitation acidity and chemistry, and its sources are generally not well captured in global models. Constraining primary emissions of HCOOH and investigating secondary formation mechanisms will provide a valuable constraint on global HCOOH budgets as well as on the ultimate fate of biomass burning emissions.

The goal is to increase the radiated terahertz average power by a factor of ten and bandwidth by a factor of two over the conventional PCA technology.

This new material has a potential to increase the carrier generation in the device and has not been investigated in THz thin film emitters yet. The second task is to incorporate low-loss dielectric nanophotonic structures to provide a performance boost beyond what has been achieved with lossy plasmonic elements. The idea is to avoid parasitic absorption or reflection in metallic layers by using transparent dielectric structures to engineer light transport into thin layers via evanescent waves or other photonic waveguiding. The third task is to measure the broadband terahertz emission spectrum of the fabricated devices, iteratively optimize their performance through modeling, and benchmark the new platform against conventional technologies. The measurements will be conducted on a THz time-domain spectroscopy system in which the emitter is the proposed device while the detector and the rest of the system will be obtained from a commercial system.

This study will use zebrafish larvae to better understand the exact ways that Schwann cells interact with neurons and tissues in their surrounding environment (especially muscle) to create properly patterned and functional peripheral nerves. Zebrafish larvae are used because they are transparent and develop peripheral nerves rapidly, enabling the coordinated development of Schwann cells and neurons to be easily studied using a combination of visualization cell movements and gene expression patterns, together with manipulative experiments in normal and mutant animals. All the experiments in this project are incorporated into collegiate coursework and independent projects for undergraduate researchers, providing technical training and education alongside scientific discovery. In addition, undergraduate students will learn best practices in public scientific communication and participate in community-engaged learning by creating new lessons and discovery center exhibits for elementary and high school students. These programs are designed to develop young scientists by improving their technical skills and lessening the communication gap with the public.<br/><br/>This study aims to define genetic factors that promote migration and differentiation of myelinating glial cells in peripheral nerves. Neural crest-derived Schwann cells coordinate development along axons to provide the necessary trophic support and insulation to conduct rapid nerve impulses.

To more fully understand these processes, the researchers will take advantage of a novel zebrafish model with muscle patterning defects that disrupt sensory axon guidance and glial migration. This project has three goals: 1) characterize Schwann cell maturation and axon elongation in wild-type and mutant zebrafish larvae, 2) test the hypothesis that a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor functions in body wall muscle to non-cell-autonomously regulate axon elongation and glial migration, and 3) identify muscle-derived guidance cues that are necessary and sufficient for glial cell migration and differentiation using in vivo gene expression analysis and in vitro culture studies.

The materials will enable studies of fibrosis, a condition resulting in scarring of the lung, heart, and other tissues, accounting for over one third of global deaths per year. Despite great efforts to study the cellular processes that cause fibrosis, the conditions which lead to fibrosis are still poorly understood. While most studies are typically performed in a Petri dish, recent discoveries show that these flat, stiff dishes cause unintended reactions that produce misleading results. To overcome this limitation, the project aims to create three-dimensional (3D) models of both healthy and scarred lung tissue, using new materials with mechanical properties that can be dynamically changed to match real pulmonary tissues. The materials will combine a synthetic soft plastic with proteins derived from lung tissue. The materials developed will be sensitive to light, changing their stiffness upon illumination, allowing spatial patterning of material stiffness. These improved 3D models will be used to study cell responses in a more natural environment. These models will be used to test how cells respond to changes in their environment, like stiffening from scarring in fibrotic lung disease, to better understand the cellular origins of these conditions. An educational curriculum to engage a range of students from middle to graduate school in the translational aspects of biotechnology and biomedical engineering is proposed to further complement these fundamental biomaterial-based studies.<br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to design and synthesize hydrolytically stable, dynamically tunable hybrid hydrogel biomaterials. Using fundamental principles of materials science and engineering, photo-addressable hybrid biomaterial platforms that will mimic critical aspects of fibrotic disease progression in vitro will be developed. A new class of photo-addressable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hybrid hydrogels will be synthesized. These innovative biomaterials will combine a phototunable PEG backbone with decellularized ECM (dECM) from healthy or diseased lung tissue, to decouple fibrotic tissue composition from subsequent changes in mechanical properties. The chemistries and multi-stage reaction schemes introduced will provide unprecedented reversible spatiotemporal control over microenvironmental mechanical properties with submicron resolution independent of composition. The materials developed will allow studying the influence of cell-matrix interactions on fibroblast mechanobiology in vitro. These materials will improve our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular processes underlying chronic diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. Improved in vitro models that reproduce key aspects of human physiology, including the dimensionality, dynamic heterogeneity, and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, will facilitate studies of critical cell-matrix interactions underlying fibrotic disease. These biomaterial systems will allow answers to fundamental questions related to fibroblast mechanobiology to be answered: 1) How do pathological changes in matrix composition and modulus influence the phenotype of encapsulated fibroblasts? 2) Which of these inputs is the more potent driver of fibrosis, i.e., the best target for therapeutics? and 3) Are these phenotypic changes reversible? An educational curriculum to engage a range of students from middle to graduate school in the translational aspects of biotechnology and biomedical engineering is proposed to further complement these fundamental biomaterial-based studies. These research and educational objectives will advance knowledge and train the next generation of engineers and scientists. Sharing the results of this project across multiple platforms within local public schools and bioengineering courses will inspire teachers and students to use STEM-principles to solve problems in life sciences and healthcare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Subjunctive-selecting clauses are those in which a speaker expresses a desire, demand, doubt, emotion, possibility, purpose, or cause. According to traditional grammar, Spanish, being a Romance language, also adheres to these restrictions. However, contrary to what is expected, Spanish-speakers select the indicative in many 'subjunctive-requiring' environments. Many frameworks used to describe the choice of mood focus exclusively on prescriptively correct patterns of selection. As a result, the unexpected use of indicative in subjunctive clauses is left untouched by traditional semantic theory. This dissertation research project, thus, aims to develop a semanto-pragmatic account of mood that can explain mood variation that is non-prescriptive. However, prior to developing such an account, the current project seeks to confirm the extent to which this variability exists, as well as the dialects in which it is present. In this way, a more comprehensive description of the Spanish mood system that accounts for both dialect-specific and non-prescriptive variability will become available. This will lead to a better understanding of Spanish, the second most common language spoken in the U.S.<br/><br/>A corpus study will be carried out in order to obtain naturally-occurring examples of mood use in the eight traditionally subjunctive-requiring contexts. The items obtained will be adapted for inclusion in an Acceptability Judgment Task (AJT). The objective is to test how specific contexts affect participant views on the acceptability of either mood. Results from the AJTs and follow-up interviews will provide greater insight into the semanto-pragmatic factors conditioning mood variation in environments in which it is not supposed to occur. The participants forming part of the experiment will come from various Spanish dialects. Since no systematic, widespread study of Spanish has been carried out, data from this project will expand on the body of knowledge that currently exists. Additionally, in terms of a theoretical standpoint, such an investigation will help to fill the research gaps related to non-prescriptive uses of mood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Now, similar to nitrogen and phosphorus, large amounts of S are also applied to some crops as fertilizers or other soil additives. In locations where atmospheric S deposition is down due to air quality policies, farmers now add S fertilizers to meet plant requirements. Often two-to-ten times the amount of S that was in rain before the Clean Air Act, S applications to croplands may have negative consequences for areas downstream. In particular, transport of excess S into wetlands can cause movement of heavy metals into the food chain, which is dangerous for animals and people. There has not been thorough study of how agricultural S additions behave in the environment and the consequences of their use. This project will fill that knowledge gap by addressing three primary objectives. The first is to develop scientific methods to measure key S cycling processes and chemical forms in crop systems. The second is to create exercises that provide middle school and undergraduate students with experience doing environmental research. The final objective is to hold workshops for farmers to discuss research findings and inform crop S management. Together, these activities will improve understanding and promote interaction to address how humans are changing the S cycle.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses a major knowledge gap in the field of biogeochemistry: quantifying how reactive S additions to agricultural systems behave in the environment and investigating the processes that control their ultimate fates and ecological consequences. The early career PI will build on her body of research in the Napa River Watershed (California, USA)?a perfect regional agricultural system where wine grapes are grown exclusively and S is applied ubiquitously at 150 kg ha-1 yr-1, on average. She has designed a focused field- and laboratory-based investigation that relies on her background in biogeochemistry and leverages her growing network of academic and stakeholder collaborators to build capacity within her research group, field of study, and the agricultural sector. Specifically, the PI will increase scientific knowledge in three main areas: (1) developing methods to quantify sulfate reduction in soil microaggregates; (2) determining chemical and S stable isotopic composition of organic S exported from agricultural systems; and (3) identifying how the forms of S and S stable isotopic composition of soils and solution waters vary not only across one agricultural area (the Napa River Watershed) but also across other croplands in the U.S. where S is used heavily. Integrated with the research activities, the PI will lead the following education and outreach efforts: (1) creating work-based learning field trips and data exploration exercises for 280 7th grade students at the Silverado Middle School where ~60% of the students are Hispanic and many are the children of workers in the local agricultural industry; (2) designing a publicly-available case study module that builds quantitative and critical thinking skills for undergraduate environmental studies students; and (3) leveraging collaborations with the Sustainability Innovation Lab at Colorado and University of California Extension to hold stakeholder workshops that communicate project findings and inform solutions for sustainable S management. In addition, the PI will continue her commitment to recruiting students from underrepresented groups to participate in this project and train them to become the next generation of interdisciplinary scholars. Ultimately, this effort will yield a broad understanding of where, when, and how S reacts in the environment?advancing knowledge of how humans are changing a fundamental element cycle and informing what to do about it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the centuries- or millennia-long time scales necessary to evaluate true long-term sustainability are often inaccessible through contemporary ecological datasets. The deep-time cultural and environmental datasets analyzed by archaeologists therefore offer a unique window into understanding sustainable agricultural practices across millennia, allowing researchers insight into both the social and environmental factors that contribute to (or inhibit) the longevity of productive agro-ecosystems systems. This project will apply a multidisciplinary archaeological and ecological approach to investigate 800+ years of indigenous agricultural activities in a windward Hawaiian Valley (Hal?wa Valley, Moloka?i Island) and evaluate its long-term productivity and sustainability. It will provide new insight into the establishment and growth of intensive agricultural systems, including the impacts of agriculture on local soils, water use, and vegetation, as well as the ways past people adapted to climatic fluctuations and resource limitations. As a community-based participatory research project, researchers will work in collaboration with local community members and non-profit organizations to facilitate archaeology and heritage management training opportunities for local stakeholders, and to apply research results towards ecosystem restoration and sustainable agriculture on Moloka?i. This research will also offer STEM training opportunities for Native Hawaiians and other underrepresented stakeholders in field, laboratory, and museum settings. <br/><br/>This project will combine re-analysis of previously excavated archaeological collections with renewed field survey and excavations in Hal?wa Valley to test the hypothesis that intensive wet-valley Hawaiian agro-ecosystems were not only highly productive, but sustainable across centuries of agricultural activities. This research will address six primary objectives: (1) archaeological survey and mapping, targeted excavation, and new high-precision radiocarbon dating will be applied to document the development of irrigated agriculture and water flow control mechanisms. (2) GIS mapping, soil, and microbotanical analyses will be applied to investigate the nature and extent of colluvial slope agriculture within the valley, an under-researched but likely critical component of food production in Hal?wa Valley. (3) Chemical analyses of soil samples will characterize soil fertility across the valley and examine the impacts of centuries of agriculture on soil nutrient availability. (4) Analysis of archival records will investigate early post-contact land use and water rights to characterize the past social and political context of agricultural systems in Hal?wa. (5) Analysis of archaeological faunal remains will examine the development of animal husbandry and its integration into food production and resource allocation decisions. Stable isotope analysis of pig, dog, and rat remains will examine changes to food webs and nutrient flows across agro-ecosystems to evaluate changing land use and sustainability. (6) Limited test excavations at Hawaiian agricultural temple (heiau) sites will provide a chronological sequence for sociopolitical developments in the valley linked to agricultural intensification and productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disasters such as the collapses of bridges and dams have very high social cost for the society not only for the disaster repair and relief, but also in terms of preventive maintenance budget and public panic factors. Previous nondestructive low-strain pile integrity testing methods such as nuclear radiation, ultrasound, sonic, radar, optical fibers and accelerometers can retrieve marker displacement and material changes, but all have applicability limitations in each of their long history of development. To date, structural integrity assurance would take great benefits from a convenient, non-invasive, reliable and cost-effective method that can be broadly deployed for long-term monitoring throughout the lifetime of the structure. In this project, a new marker-based ultra-high precision positioning system is envisioned, which employs the passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to directly measure internal displacement of specific structural points caused by creep and deformation. These tags can be embedded in new piles and building materials to provide a novel alternative to structural integrity testing, replacing or complementing existing methods. As the passive tag never needs maintenance or recharging, it can have a lifetime as long as the structure.  Integrity testing can be simply executed by placing the custom RFID reader at designated external points to report the precise location or vibration of the buried tags. The sensing radio frequency is selected properly so that it is not too high that would result in poor material penetration or too low that would result in poor ranging precision. This proposed structural ""radar"" enables the seeing of the previously unseen structural concerns and stimulates students' interest of engineering wonders that will have positive impacts to society.  <br/><br/>This project aims to establish a new precision radio frequency (RF) ranging and locating method for noninvasive long-term structural integrity monitoring. The ultra-high frequency signal can penetrate deep into the building materials to locate specific marker tags buried in the structure with spatial accuracy around 20 microns and temporal resolutions below millisecond. The method is based on the passive harmonic RFID platform and backscattered 2nd harmonic of the impinging signal to minimize the phase noise from self-jamming. The remaining phase noises were further mitigated by frequency strategy, stable reference, moving average, and zero-point calibration. The research tasks include RF frontend improvement, system-level improvement, and civil structure demonstration, which will bring forth verified demonstration of the new noninvasive sensing scheme in realistic scenarios with the targeted performance and reliability. Multiple incoherent frequencies will be employed in RF frontend to simultaneously improve both operational distance and the spatial resolution. Multi-path variation tolerance can be further mitigated by randomizing antennas and artificial beamforming. Geometrical dilution of precision in 3D locating will be mitigated by antenna placement and evaluation of angle of arrival, so that the system can achieve 3D locating with 5-micron accuracy and 1 million samples per second. The system will be experimentally demonstrated in realistic civil structures of concrete mixes and weight-bearing beams. By using multi-tag method with known tag separation, permittivity change due to temperature and metal corrosion sensing will be investigated. If successful, the resulting high-precision strain sensor can bring forth a cost-effective noninvasive method that will greatly improve the structural integrity monitoring. The precision locating method can also be applied to many other applications in precision instrument, foundation engineering, and human-machine interface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent discovery of organisms that utilize certain lanthanides for specific cellular functions suggests that learning how these organisms selectively take up and use lanthanides could lead to the development of new methods for the efficient detection, capture, and recycling of these important elements. This project of Professor Cotruvo from the Pennsylvania State University and funded by the Chemistry Of Life Processes Program seeks to characterize metal binding to natural lanthanide-binding proteins, a first step in setting the groundwork for potential applications of these proteins in rare earth harvesting and recycling. The outreach efforts of this program focus on the education of the next generation of scientists. A primary objective is the implementation of a professional development program that includes lab rotations for freshmen and sophomores at Penn State. The goal of the program is to help the undergraduate students discover chemistry research questions about which they are passionate and to lower the barriers to pursuing undergraduate research for these students.<br/><br/>The over-arching goal of this research project is to gain a fundamental understanding of how biological systems selectively recognize lanthanides over other, more abundant metal ions. Recent studies have shown that lanthanides are specifically utilized by certain bacteria. This research follows from the recent discovery and preliminary characterization of the first lanthanide-binding proteins that are not enzymes. These novel proteins may be used in the future to address the challenging chemical problem of harvesting lanthanides and other rare earth elements because they bind lanthanides reversibly and selectively. The project aims to use a variety of structural and spectroscopic methods to elucidate the lanthanide coordination by Methylorubrum extorquens lanmodulin, a recently discovered protein that binds lanthanides with picomolar affinity and million-fold selectivity over many other common elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alternatively, such ingested particles can be transported to other compartments and integrated into cellular metabolism.  The research will determine if different cells are relying on the same mechanisms, or whether, over time, have evolved diverse mechanisms to achieve similar tasks. The research will also address how cells control the transport of ingested particles by implementing experiments which test the hypothesis that the various possible outcomes are in competition with one another, and that a cell can precisely regulate the ?flow? down different pathways. <br/><br/>     The project will be pursued in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and will focus on pathways in the ?endolysosomal? network.  Tetrahymena ingests bacteria by a phagocytosis-dependent pathway, and then digests those bacteria in phagolysosomes whose activity depends on delivery of hydrolytic enzymes. The research will define the pathways involved in delivery of proteins to phagolysosomes and ask whether they are the same or different as the pathways used in mammalian cells. In Tetrahymena, hydrolytic enzymes are also delivered to generate a specific secretory compartment.  Experiments in the project will test the hypothesis that competition between molecular tethering complexes in the CORVET family determines the relative flux of key hydrolytic enzymes to secretory organelles vs phagolysosomes, depending on cellular conditions. The experiments will be based on natural and induced fluctuations in the abundance of specific CORVET subunits.  The experiments will also take advantage of the fact that CORVET tethers are recruited by Rab GTPases, so that manipulation of Rab activities can be used to indirectly influence CORVET function.

They accumulate near interfaces, bringing as yet largely untapped degrees of freedom to interfacial engineering. Here, active colloid motion will be studied to develop these objects as Active Surface Agents. These agents can improve mixing for chemical processes, and can lead to new encapsulation and release methods. Furthermore, they are important in new technological spaces like micro-robotics, where small objects perform tasks like moving cargo or releasing a signal. The field of active colloids is inspired by motile bacteria, which can move at extraordinary rates, typically over distances ten times greater than their size in a second. There are also synthetic active colloids. An important example is a polymer micron bead with a platinum patch which reacts with common chemicals like hydrogen peroxide, which fuels their motion.  Plain colloids, absent activity, are used to form organized structures at fluid interfaces between fluids that do not mix to stabilize oil in water emulsions, widely used to encapsulate oily substances in water in personal care products and to formulate pharmaceuticals. Fluid interfaces are special environments for chemical reaction and separation. For example, if catalysts are present at fluid interfaces, reagents in the oil phase can form products that prefer the water phase. This facilitates reaction and separation in green processes. Innovation can have economic and social impact. Furthermore, this research will advance Sciences Technology Engineering and Mathematics education, including doctoral student and undergraduate researcher training, and as course material in the Interfacial Phenomena course. The outcome of the proposed research will be presented in outreach activities to attract students from diverse backgrounds to engineering. Furthermore, research findings will be conveyed in demonstrations for the public.<br/><br/>Bacteria will be used as a model system. This research will develop a general framework to identify desired active surface agent properties including trajectory type, propulsion strength, and surface density to generate a desired active interfacial layer. The results will lay the ground work to promote mixing at interfaces of emulsions or of thin liquid films or other multi-phase system using active colloidal layers. All active colloids obey similar hydrodynamic descriptions, which this research will develop. Active colloids accumulate near interfaces and can swim adjacent to them, trapped via hydrodynamic interactions, or can swim in an adhered state with complex trajectories that differ from those in bulk in both form and spatio-temporal implications.  This research will develop a library of responses of individual swimmers on and near interfaces to understand their individual behaviors using experiment and theory. This research will probe how motion in the interface, a two dimensional active sheet, propagates into the adjacent fluids. By understanding these implications, new design rules for active interfaces can be established to enhance transport in multiphase systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first, known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), occurred circa 2.3-2.4 billion years ago when atmospheric oxygen levels increased to 1-10% of present day levels. This rise in oxygen levels left an indelible imprint on the sedimentary rock record through the onset of oxidative weathering and shifts in stable isotope compositions. During this same time interval, the igneous (or magmatic) rock record underwent significant chemical and isotopic changes. The proposed research will investigate whether the changes in the sedimentary and igneous rock records are linked through studying the stable isotopes of a unique suite of igneous rocks known as strongly peraluminous granites (SPGs). SPGs form when sedimentary rocks are metamorphosed and partially melted to form granitic melts. SPGs therefore represent an endmember igneous archive of a pure sedimentary contribution (through partial melting and assimilation) to the igneous rock record. Through analyzing the isotopes of SPGs on either side of the GOE, this study will determine if and how changing sedimentary compositions affected the igneous rock record across this critical transition in Earth?s history. The PI will lead an integrated research and education plan designed to encourage participation and retention of under-represented minorities in OFW-based research through a multi-tiered mentoring system. This project supports one female or minority graduate student at Caltech, 3 undergraduate summer fellows, 3 high-school student and teacher interns from the Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD), and annual classroom lessons and field trips for PUSD middle schoolers to the local San Gabriel Mountains. <br/>	<br/>The proposed research in this CAREER project will explore how the GOE influenced the O, S, and Fe isotope record of igneous rocks through partial melting or assimilation of sediments. The research examines Archean and Proterozoic strongly peraluminous granites, which represent pure partial melts of metasedimentary rocks. This research has three main objectives. First, it will shed light on the underlying causes for shifts observed in the stable isotope record of igneous rocks across the GOE. For example, the increase in O isotope ratios in magmatic zircon has been variably ascribed to the onset of plate tectonics and recycling of sedimentary rocks or to the rise of oxidative, subaerial weathering generating heavier O isotope ratios in sediments. If the latter is true, a shift in the oxygen isotope ratios of zircon from Archean and Proterozoic SPGs should be observed. Second, this research will explore in detail how Fe and S isotopes are transferred from sediments to igneous rocks through detailed field studies of two ?focus? localities which preserved representative source metasedimentary rocks, as well as, the derivative SPG. Third, the SPGs provide an alternative archive to the sedimentary record in that they homogenize large volumes of sedimentary rocks and thus can yield information on average sedimentary compositions. Importantly, this work will establish a ?reference collection? of SPGs, which will be curated at Caltech and made available to external researchers to investigate other aspects of their chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology uses passive infrared (PIR) sensors to collect lightweight data and identify user behavior, which is traditionally done by camera and image recognition at higher processing power and cost. One possible application includes optimizing mall market targeting and revenue growth by generating traffic flow and headcount analytics. This technology also may help commercial properties and hotels to understand their customers? needs better and create cross-sale opportunities through features including individual behavior path predicting, crowd behavior prediction, population forecasts, and specific behavioral analytics, like queue management and purchase-tracking habits. Another possible application is in automating rental property management for homeowners by remotely coordinating check-in and check-out procedures, monitoring cleaning results, and diminishing the likelihood of unpermitted parties, fire, flood, or theft.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel neural network system that can classify low pixel thermal data into the number of users and type of user posture. With non-fragmented thermal data in architectural space, the proposed method is capable of matching user behavior with hassle-free automation. Using 64 thermal data points from a single PIR sensor, the system can real-time classify the dataset into occupancy numbers at a 95% accuracy rate and possible postures in under 800ms. With more sensors in the network, the system can identify specific user behavior and indoor location. These behavior data are the key to achieve frustration-free automation in smart living and working spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiphase chemical observations have been made at WFM since the mid-1970s, when there was particular interest in the conversion of gas-phase sulfur dioxide emissions to aerosol sulfate resulting in acidic rain. Subsequent to the implementation of federal and regional air quality standards, the chemistry occurring within the clouds at this location has changed substantially. These changes suggest the emergence of a new chemical regime dominated by organics and ammonium.  This project is investigating this changing chemical regime.<br/><br/>The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that cloud processing continues to alter the chemical composition of ambient aerosols in the northeastern U.S., in ways that fundamentally differ from the dominant inorganic processes in previous decades. More specifically, cloud processing increases secondary organic aerosol mass via condensation of soluble organic gases and subsequent aqueous reactions, yielding less volatile organic compounds that remain in the condensed phase upon droplet evaporation. The proposed research will investigate the following science questions: (1) What is driving the increasing trend in water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) at WFM? (2) What happens to the excess ammonia and WSOC vapor when the cloud droplets evaporate? and (3) Will increases in excess ammonia lead to increased WSOC in the future?  The proposed research will build upon past and ongoing research at WFM and lead to a better understanding of multiphase chemical processes occurring within clouds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most current multi-robot systems are ""brittle"" since the failure of a single robot may bring the whole team down. Cyber-attacks that incapacitate robots or compromise their sensors are becoming increasingly realistic. This project will focus on multi-robot coordination in scenarios where the robots operate in failure-prone or adversarial environments. The key question that the project will address is how can a team of robots carefully coordinate and adapt their actions to make them resilient to failures. The outcomes of this project will be a significant step towards the overarching vision of persistent and reliable autonomous operations in real-world conditions. These research activities will go hand-in-hand with educational and outreach activities that will integrate real-world examples of multi-robot coordination in precision agriculture and environmental monitoring to train the next generation of engineers in multi-disciplinary thinking. To broaden participation from underrepresented minorities, the project will develop a new hands-on robot programming summer camp for middle-school students. To ensure broad applicability, middle-school teachers will be trained in this workshop with the goal of them incorporating the technical activities in their classrooms. The investigator will develop a new course on multi-robot coordination and mentor undergraduate/graduate students, who are the future faculty, to create and lead a new design-oriented course through the Student Initiated Courses program. Dissemination of our findings will be achieved through workshops, articles geared toward broader audiences, and community outreach events.<br/><br/>The main intellectual contributions of this project are in the introduction of a novel class of problems and development of new algorithms and theoretical limits for multi-robot coordination in adversarial and uncertain settings. The underlying framework will be based on submodular optimization which is an often-used technique in multi-robot coordination. Existing works that use submodular optimization for coordination typically assume that the function value can be computed exactly. The key contribution of this project will be to relax this assumption which leads to a wide variety of research problems that will be investigated. Broadly speaking, three classes of problems will be investigated: devising offline coordinated deployments that are secure against adversarial attacks; devising online, adaptive strategies that are resilient to real-time failures and attacks; and devising online and offline plans that take into account novel measures of risk in stochastic submodular optimization. Various versions of the problem such as: distributed and scalable; richer attack models particularly for distributed networks; and richer utility functions particularly those using deep neural networks, will be investigated. The project seeks to devise algorithms with constant factor approximation and constant competitive ratio guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans usually do not follow a fixed stationary model. They change and adapt to each other and to the robots over time.  Humans gain experience - people's driving behavior when interacting with an autonomous car will be significantly different after many interactions. In assistive robotics, human responses will change as robots adapt. Routing decisions of autonomous cars influence other human drivers' routing choices and can result in undesirable global properties such as congestion.  This introduces a new set of challenges including how robots should plan for safe and reliable strategies that are aware of their effects on people and the society as a whole. This project lays the foundations of analyzing and planning for repeated interactions between humans and robots. Our work will directly impact humans' comfort, safety, and public life by increasing robot understanding in interactions with humans in environments such as homes, hospitals, warehouses, and smart cities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to focus on one of the key components of safe and interactive robotics -- formalizing influencing interactions, i.e., robot actions that influence human responses. This requires developing computational models of human behaviors, and leads to better understanding and formalisms for safe and reliable interactions with robots. This project investigates three main challenges: 1) human modeling: the investigator will develop data efficient methods to learn computational models of human behaviors while interacting with autonomous systems. One of the challenges in human-robot interaction is the lack of data from humans. This work develops active learning techniques that intelligently query and integrate different types of data collected from human feedback. 2) influencing interactions: it is clear that humans can be influenced by simple interactions with each other, e.g., people plan to arrive late if they are meeting a friend who is always late. Similarly, people's behavior changes when interacting with robots. If they observe an autonomous car being stuck at an intersection multiple times, they decide to navigate around it. This project plans to design robotics algorithms that are mindful of their effects on humans, how they can change the human behavior, and how that can help the overall system.  3) safe interactions: when planning for interactions that influence people, the robot will rely on learned human models. However, having access to a truly correct and reliable human model can be challenging due to lack of data or insufficient model parameters. This project designs verified robot policies that will be robust to inaccuracies present in human models, and takes the overall system to desirable states over long-term interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the central questions studied in these fields are different, they have had fruitful interaction, and each field has benefited from developments in the others. While some of these connections are centuries old, there have been exciting developments in recent years. The award will allow a diverse group of mostly early-career mathematicians to interact with more established researchers. Bringing together this group will provide an excellent opportunity for interaction, shared insight, and further development. The organizers expect this to be a valuable educational opportunity as well as a research conference. Holding this conference at the SCGP will make it accessible and visible to the physics community, leading to interactions that might not occur as readily otherwise.<br/><br/>The workshop will bring together experts from interconnected fields. One example is the connection between Brownian motion, harmonic measure, analysis of singular integrals, and geometric properties of domains. This topic relates how a randomly-moving particle sees the boundary of the region in which it moves, the equilibrium charge distribution on the boundary of this region, and classical questions in analysis. Another example concerns function theory and dynamical systems: which geometric properties of functions are most important in studying the associated dynamical system formed by the iterates of the function, and on the other hand, what can the dynamical system tell us about the geometry of the initial function? The speakers include prominent researchers from a wide range of areas, including computer science, applied mathematics, dynamical systems, probability, analysis, and geometry. Many speakers have a history of making good use of such interchanges for groundbreaking work, some with important practical applications. Some specific examples are Ingrid Daubechies? work on wavelets and their numerous applications (for example, image compression), Peter Jones? work on diffusion geometry for data analysis, Svitlana Mayboroda?s work on localization of waves (used in LED light design), and Assaf Naor?s work on metric embeddings and algorithms, with applications in computer science.

According to the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, only 10% of the 115k people in the U.S needed a lifesaving organ transplant in 2018 received it.  A major obstacle to producing viable artificial tissues is product variability.  The proposed technology overcomes that limitation by enabling non-disruptive control over the cell behavior at any location within the living artificial tissues as they are being cultured.  Additionally, it allows for nondestructive analysis of the cell behavior, which will impact the markets where the cultures are used for things like production of biological molecules, toxicity and pharmaceutical testing, etc., by lowering experiment costs relative to the conventional (typically sacrificial) analysis.  Lastly, the fact that the culturing platform is automated solves another major logistical hurdle to the adoption of such technologies, by allowing companies to provide computer codes to hospital staff instead of having to teach them custom culturing protocols for each new product.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will allow for better understanding of how the proposed cell culturing technology can offer solutions to the clinical market; while also providing technological insight to members of the tissue engineering industry, and opportunities for significant improvements to their existing culturing systems and practices.  The proposed technology is a tissue engineering scaffold interlaced with vascular-like microchannels, which help to overcome major bottlenecks limiting the conventional biomanufacturing approaches.  Additionally, it offers multiple benefits to other market segments that involve cell culturing.  For example, the technology has been demonstrated to enable new discoveries by allowing researchers to perform localized collections of mini cell biopsies and effluent for ex-situ analysis; additive and subtractive cell operations in living cell cultures, tissue patterning and overgrowth removal; establishing dynamic drug gradients and custom delivery protocols; overcoming size-limitations by nourishing cells deep within large cultures and removing metabolic waste from those regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Subduction zones are responsible for some of the most important global geologic events and significantly impact humans and populated areas by causing earthquakes and creating large volcanic arcs such as the Pacific ?Ring of Fire?. Uncertainty exists in the degree to which subduction zone volcanism is controlled by the exchange of material and fluids between the subducting plate and the overlying mantle rocks. One way to study such processes, is to analyze rocks that were previously subducted to great depths but have since been exhumed and returned to the Earth?s surface. The aim of this project is to investigate the record of the release and characteristics of fluids produced during subduction contained within individual garnet crystals in exhumed subduction zone rocks from the Western Alps (Italy/Switzerland). This study will further our understanding into the importance of subduction-derived fluids in controlling whether rocks within the subducting plate and the overlying mantle are more chemically oxidized or reduced, which will provide insights into their role in controlling volcanic arc magmatism. This project will support a post-doctoral researcher at Boston College, who will work with undergraduate students, providing them with training in analytical techniques and research experience. The research team from Boston College will work with a large network of collaborators from Europe and the US. An important component of this project will include undergraduate students travelling to Europe to conduct their own research with the help of European collaborators. <br/><br/>Much debate exists around the role of metamorphic fluids, released during dehydration of the subducting slab, in controlling the redox conditions of the overlying sub-arc mantle and in explaining the oxidized and volatile-enriched geochemical signatures of volcanic arc magmas. The transfer of multi-valent, redox-sensitive elements such as S, C, and Fe from the subducting slab, represents a potential mechanism to produce oxidation of the sub-arc mantle. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that oxidizing species are released within fluids during dehydration of the mafic component of the slab during subduction. This study involves creating a field-based record of the release of fluids during subduction of the mafic crust, examining whether these fluids contain oxidizing species, and assessing the implications for changing redox conditions within the subducting mafic slab and overlying sub-arc mantle. To achieve this, the project will utilize the first coupled Fe and Zn isotopic analyses of growth zones within individual garnet crystals from exhumed high-pressure metamorphic rocks from the Western Alps. This will be combined with precise Sm/Nd zoned garnet geochronology to provide insights into the rates and timescales of redox-controlling metamorphic reactions. With the help of an international network of collaborators, this project aims to provide a uniquely high-resolution geochemical and geochronological dataset to assess processes occurring at the subduction zone interface and their relationship to oxidation of the sub-arc mantle and volcanic arc magmatism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, this conference will enhance infrastructure by providing a forum to enable networking and formation of new collaborations among senior scientists, trainees, and junior investigators in the plant genome editing field. Keystone Symposia conferences also provide additional value and importance to nurturing the next generation of scientists by providing them with the opportunity to actively take part in discussions and poster sessions. Moreover, this conference will acquaint trainees and investigators new to field with the state-of-the-art science in the field, provide opportunities for critical scientific feedback, and promote career development for trainees and new investigators, including opportunities both to see successful scientists present cutting-edge science and to network with prospective mentors and others who might contribute to their scientific and professional development.<br/><br/><br/>The Keystone Symposia conference on Plant Genome Engineering: From Lab to Field focuses on the latest gene editing advances, with an emphasis on the development of new tools and to understand how these tools might be used to dissect plant gene function and develop new crop traits. Although this field is still very young, it is maturing at a rapid pace. Originally, plant genome research had the primary goal to develop and implement tools and reagents that effectively target specific DNA sequences, a goal shared by researchers working on diverse systems, including plants, animals and fungi. With the advent of Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and shortly thereafter CRISPR/Cas systems, the DNA targeting problem was solved. Thus, the current goal of the field is to efficiently implement gene editing in specific biological systems. Therefore, this conference brings together scientists who work on tool development, plant transformation, plant breeding and crop trait development. This conference will provide a platform which should enable a swift transfer of the benefits of the technology to that field. This conference will help build a community of researchers interested in overcoming the obstacles in plant gene editing, which include the delivery of gene editing reagents to plant cells and improved methods of plant transformation. This community is essential to move the field forward, as found by evidence of a previous National Science Foundation (NSF) conference which identified certain bottlenecks in plant gene editing.<br/><br/>This award is supported jointly by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This band, known as the inter-tropical convergence zone, or ITCZ, is generally found north of the equator with a mean latitude of about 6N.  Many aspects of the ITCZ including its existence, its role in global atmospheric circulation, and its preference for the Northern Hemisphere can be understood by thinking of the ITCZ as a uniform strip of convection with the same width, central latitude, and rainfall intensity at all longitudes.  But this longitudinally averaged view of the ITCZ overlooks substantial variations in ITCZ latitude around the tropics.  In particular the ITCZ is found south of the equator in the Indian Ocean and it has a southwest to northeast slope across both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  The latitude of the ITCZ can thus be anywhere from from 4S to 10N depending on the ocean basin, the longitude within that basin, and the time of year.<br/><br/>This project uses combination of observational analysis and carefully designed model simulations to study regional variations in ITCZ latitude and other properties.  For instance the northward displacement of the ITCZ in the eastern Pacific has been attributed to the geography of the North and South American coastlines, an idea which can be tested through simulations in which the west coasts of the Americas are mirror images of each other.  The importance of oceanic processes is tested using simplified ocean configurations which allow some mechanisms but disable others.  Ocean model configurations include a simple motionless ""slab"" ocean, a modified slab ocean which captures near-surface heat transport driven by surface winds, and a ""shallow water"" ocean model which allows surface cooling due to the upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean.  In addition, the project develops a version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in which flux corrections are applied to improve the representation of the ITCZ.<br/><br/>The work is of practical interest given the importance of the ITCZ for tropical rainfall as well as its outsized effects on the climate and atmospheric circulation of the earth.  Despite its importance the ITCZ is not well simulated in models used for weather prediction and climate change projections, thus a better understanding of ITCZ dynamics could be quite useful for model improvement.  The work also has value for the broader research enterprise, as model configurations developed for the project will be openly available for adoption by the worldwide research community.  In addition, the award provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby contributing to scientific workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Descemets membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is an advanced procedure involving transplantation of a thin layer of the cornea with outstanding clinical outcomes. However, this places a significant burden on eye banks as they use a difficult, time- and cost-intensive process to isolate the thin layer of the donor cornea (DMEK graft), subsequently provided to a surgeon for transplantation. The proposed research will enable development and evaluation of a novel to decrease the difficulty of DMEK graft preparation, reduce the time required, and expand the eligible donor pool. Improving the graft preparation process will result in increased economic efficiency within eye banks, and help enable greater access to vision-restoring DMEK procedures to individuals in the United States.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to develop and evaluate a novel, first-in-class graft preparation device that standardizes, de-skills, and improves the viability of the liquid bubble technique (LBT) for DMEK graft preparation. The proposed device overcomes the major barriers to LBT adoption: (1) consistent needle insertion into the correct tissue plane and (2) endothelial cell loss (ECL) due to high pressure in the cornea.  It does so via a stabilizing corneal base in conjunction with a needle insertion system to allow for simple, standardized DMEK preparation in under 5 minutes with less than 5% failure rates at appropriate graft viability, even in diabetic and obese donor corneas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many common food crops, including tomatoes and peppers, are highly susceptible to fungal contamination; these organisms are rapidly developing resistance to the chemical pesticides widely used today.  The objective of this project is to develop and test a new biofungicide consisting of beneficial fungi to protect plants from variety of diseases and plagues. This solution does not cause harm to the environment and offers a way to manage pesticide-resistant pathogens, which cost approximately $10 billion in the farming market. The proposed project will optimize the biofungicide for the many types of soils, crops and pathogens common across the country. A series of laboratory tests will be conducted to determine the optimal composition of the solution. <br/><br/>The proposed project involves designing an effective bioprotectant and biostimulant, consisting of two different Trichoderma strains, to provide enhanced protective effects against harmful fungi and bacteria, with the added benefit of boosting plant health and improving overall crop yield. This project will develop new formulations of the blended strain biofungicide to provide maximum flexibility in their application, stability for storage and delivery, as well as testing and optimizing their efficacy in new and unproven combinations of plants, soils and growing conditions. The merits of the bioprotectant anti-fungal have already been demonstrated in preliminary experiments, but only for limited combinations of crops and soils.  Relevant environments will be tested in this project.  Additionally, previous tests have been conducted with dry formulations of Trichoderma, and thus the proposed research will focus on the two key objectives of (i) proving efficacy in new contexts and (ii) developing stable liquid formulations.

These plates are in motion with respect to one another, moving at speeds on the order of 1-20 cm/yr. The interaction of the tectonic plates is characterized by convergent, divergent, and shearing motion, with the majority of deformation (earthquakes, volcanism, and mountain building) concentrated at the plate boundaries. Subduction zones are convergent plate boundaries where the denser oceanic plates bend downward, leaving the Earth?s surface, and descend into the underlying mantle. The majority of the Earth?s subduction zones occur along the Pacific Rim of Fire and are characterized by large-scale earthquake activity where plates slide past one another and by arc volcanoes in the upper plate due to fluids released by the subducting slab as it descends into the mantle. This proposal leverages data-driven model design, high performance computing, and three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality to construct high-resolution 3D models of the Pacific Rim of Fire. The geodynamic models of the Pacific Rim of Fire will investigate a new class of volcanoes that occur at the edges of subduction zones, rather than typical arc volcanoes located above the subducted plate. In addition, the geodynamic models will examine slab-driven mantle flow, addressing outstanding questions of coupling between the tectonic plates and the mantle. In terms of broader impacts, the PI will collaborate with the Space Visualization Lab at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, IL to develop 3D visualizations of subduction along the Pacific Rim of Fire. These visualizations will enable data exploration as people can tour the plate tectonic boundaries through a series of virtual voyages through the Earth. Furthermore, the subduction zones that flank the Pacific Ocean form major tectonic hazards affecting over 20 countries, including major populations centers, making the high-resolution simulations of this region likely to have a large societal impact.  A graduate student and undergraduate students will be trained and actively involved in this research.<br/><br/>Subduction at convergent plate margins, characterized by descending oceanic lithosphere and subparallel tracts of oceanic trenches and arc volcanoes, has commonly been distilled into a two-dimensional (2D) paradigm. However, modern subduction systems contain discontinuous slabs that are not infinitely long and over half of the slabs intersect or interact directly with another slab, invalidating the 2D subduction approximation. Furthermore, although arc volcanoes do track subducted slabs at depth in most subduction zones, anomalous volcanoes also systematically occur, not above a slab, but distal to the slab edge forming a pattern not explained by the 2D subduction paradigm. In addition, rock deformation experiments indicate that much of the upper mantle is governed by nonlinear rheology, indicating slab-driven flow at intersecting slabs is not a linear combination of variations on the 2D Newtonian framework. The proposed research will build comprehensive 3D geodynamic models of the entire Pacific Rim of Fire that will allow for systematic comparative analysis of natural subduction zones and move the field into a 3D framework of subduction, rather than the 2D paradigm that has governed the broader research community and undergraduate textbooks. Specifically, the numerical simulations will test two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that slab edge driven mantle upwelling is a common phenomenon, constrained geometrically by the three-dimensional subduction geometry and physically by the constraints on the motion of density anomalies due to conservation of mass and momentum of viscous flow in the asthenosphere. The second hypothesis is that the shear thinning effects of the dislocation creep deformation mechanism of olivine constrains the lateral extent of non-plate motion aligned shear wave splitting in observed subduction zones, by allowing the localized upper mantle near the subduction zone to decouple from the larger-scale mantle circulation patterns. A data-driven 3D model of the Pacific Rim of Fire will provide the ideal system to constrain these phenomena, because a geographically referenced model can spatially link upwellings in the asthenosphere to specific observed locations of anomalous volcanics along the Pacific Rim of Fire, as well as predict the extent of nonlinear mantle flow which can be directly compared to shear wave splitting observations from the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whooping cough is the only vaccine-preventable infection that remains endemic in the US. Conventional pathogen detection methods either take a long time or require costly and bulky instruments, limiting their applications for low-resource settings. The new microfluidic device can provide low-cost, rapid and accurate detection of whooping cough at the point of care, enabling rapid and accurate POC detection of whooping cough in rural clinical settings and other venues.  The microfluidic device may also be used to detect a variety of other pathogens, such as foodborne pathogens. <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is primarily intended to commercialize the microdevice for POC detection of pathogens. The core technology is based on integrated DNA isothermal amplification on a low-cost paper/polymer hybrid microfluidic device. The instrument-free detection by the naked eye minimizes instrumentation requirements, while DNA amplification and 6 primers specific to the target ensure high detection sensitivity and high accuracy, respectively.

One of the biggest impacts of vegetation is trapping and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The vast Amazon rainforest makes a significant contribution to this carbon storage function. However, the Amazon forest is being threatened by recent changes to climate, which is making droughts stronger and more frequent. A big question is whether the Amazon will be resilient to these droughts, or whether they will slow forest growth and kill trees, which would release carbon. A significant challenge is the lack of information about a large portion of the Amazon forest?about 30%?with shallow water tables, where trees live in an environment of excess water. In these water-logged forests, tree growth is slow because soil conditions are poor for tree roots. Here, drought could actually be beneficial to trees by reducing this water-logging. On the other hand, these forests have roots that grow close to the soil surface and require wet conditions. In this case, strong droughts that last a long time dry the upper soil and could reduce growth more, killing more trees than in forests with well-drained soils. This project will answer questions about the role of belowground water sources as an important control on response of tropical forest to drought. Data about forest growth and carbon dioxide exchange will be made available to the broader research community. This project will also help train students in how to measure forests, and provide information about tropical forests to the public.<br/><br/>This project will measure forest canopy response to drought at sites in the Brazilian Amazon. The approach is to unify field ecology with remote observation of ecosystems from canopy towers and satellites. Canopy towers constructed in this project?representing the first of their kind in water-logged soils of the interior Amazon?provide detailed information about tree growth. The capacity of the forest canopy for photosynthesis will be measured as well as leaf demography and phenology. This new knowledge will be combined with networks of existing canopy towers in deep water table depth sites, satellite images spanning the Amazon, data on tree growth and death from a network of forest surveys, and detailed measurements of soil water and other environmental factors. This project will build an accurate new understanding of the factors that impact forest carbon cycling, while contrasting water-logged with well-drained soil responses. A data-based model of ecosystem structure and function will offer a quantitative accounting of the contribution of these water-logged forests in the Amazon to climate change responses. These results have the potential to transform our current perspective on drought effects in tropical forests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Earth Sciences, understanding friction is critical for a better understanding of the hazards associated with earthquakes and landslides. The friction properties of materials have been studied for centuries, but the physics and chemistry underlying their time dependence remain obscure. Yet, small fluctuations in friction properties during earthquakes and landslides can have tremendous effects on the size and speed of these events. Friction on sliding interfaces such as tectonics faults are usually described by the so called ""rate- and state-dependent friction"" laws. These empirical laws account for the sliding speed (""rate"") and for the evolving properties of the interface termed ""state""; this latter, a function of the slip history, is difficult to observe directly. The rate-and-state framework is widely used to model frictional sliding.  But the corresponding laws fail to accurately describe laboratory observations for a range of conditions relevant to earthquakes. Here, the team aims to better understand the physics underlying the frictional properties of rocks. The researchers use computer simulations to model the behavior of granular layers of finely-ground rock, called gouge, that are present along tectonic faults. The goal is to test whether rock friction and its time dependence is governed at the grain scale by grain-to-grain interactions. The simulation outputs are constrained by experimental observations: in many cases they describe them better than the most successful rate-and-state friction laws.  The team, thus, gradually unveils the physics underlying the behavior of earthquake-generating faults. In addition to its strong societal relevance, this project provides support for an early career scientist as well as training for undergraduate students. <br/><br/><br/>To model the behavior of the gouge, the researchers employ Discrete Element Method simulations. They use model geometries and loading conditions designed to mimic standard rock-friction experiments, such as ""velocity-step"" and ""slide-hold-reslide"" protocols. They test the hypothesis that rock friction as observed in the laboratory is governed by time-independent properties at the grain-grain contact scale. This innovative approach differs from more traditional ones which assume that time-dependent plasticity or chemical bonding at microscopic contacts are the source of the rate-and-state dependence of friction. The granular simulations are consistent with the most successful rate-and-state-dependent friction equations for sliding protocols where those equations accurately describe experiments (""velocity-step"" and ?slide-hold? protocols). They better match laboratory data for sliding protocols where those equations fail (e.g., the reslides following ""slide-hold"" protocols). Furthermore, output of the granular simulations allows investigating the source of the rate-and-state-dependent friction-like behavior of the model.  The team finds that if the kinetic energy of the gouge particles is suitably normalized by the confining pressure, it produces an estimate of the velocity dependence that is consistent with the simulations and within the ballpark of laboratory data. The researchers continue exploring the granular flow model by comparing it to a wider range of sliding protocols that are not well explained by existing equations (e.g., ""slide-hold-reslide"" and ""normal-stress-step"" experiments).  They also compare the compaction/dilation of the gouge layers in the simulations to experimental observations; the goal is to evaluate the role of porosity on the gouge sliding behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While OPaC chemicals have greatly improved crop yields, they have also (1) caused accumulation of pesticide residues in the food chain, (2) promoted the generation of pesticide-resistant insects, and (3) contaminated the air, water and soil.  OPaC residues, therefore, are a significant public health concern.  The proposed sensor will:  increase the sensitivity and specificity for monitoring OPaCs (2) reduce costs associated with pesticide monitoring, and (3) improve portability of monitoring devices. Finally, the proposed biosensor technology could be adaptable for analyzing biofluids, making it transformative in monitoring environmental exposures.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a more sensitive, field-deployable electrochemical biosensor for the detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticide (OPaC) residues. The system?s principle is that OPaCs bind/inhibit the activity of a highly sensitive designer acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, diminishing a readily detectable electrochemical current.  At the system?s core is a novel AChE enzyme more sensitive to OPaC residues than those currently in use.  The approach will further optimize the performance of this novel enzyme by rationally designing variants that decrease aggregation and increase/improve thermal stability, core packing, surface polarity, and backbone rigidity.  Finally, the approach will enhance OPaC detection sensitivity even further by increasing the surface area of the electrochemical sensory apparatus.  Briefly, the procedure is to submerge the sensor into a buffer to acquire and assign baseline data, add test samples to allow any OPaCs to bind to the optimized AChE enzyme on the sensor, add the AChE substrate acetylthiocholine to the sample, and measure electrochemical inhibition.  Taken together, this novel biosensor will result in a major shift in the way OPaC analysis is performed and pave the way for reliable, sensitive, and low-cost field analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will use advanced and durable video technologies that permit high-resolution measures of locomotion in the wild. The results of this project will further our understanding of locomotor adaptations that are thought to be central to the evolution of our early primate ancestors. The project will support undergraduate and graduate student training and will enhance K-12 STEM education and public outreach through high school programs and collaborations with established science outreach programs at UT Austin.

The project expands upon the investigators' previous analysis of quadrupedalism among platyrrhines and includes a three-dimensional kinematic analysis of arboreal leaping. The investigators will document locomotor kinematics of primates moving in their natural habitats using multi-camera, high-speed, high-resolution videography, sampling arboreal locomotion on a range of substrates and quantifying standard kinematic spatiotemporal variables. The morphology of the arboreal locomotor substrates will be quantified using novel remote sensing methods, with specific measurements including substrate diameter, orientation, height above the ground, and compliance. By expanding the sampled range of locomotor behaviors, body sizes, substrates, and taxa, this project will facilitate a more comprehensive investigation of how substrate variation and phylogenetic history have influenced primate locomotor adaptation and evolution.

TGFs are extraordinarily powerful bursts of gamma radiation; gamma-rays are particles of invisible light, similar to x-rays but in this case with energies up to about 100 times higher than the x-rays used by doctors and dentists. Although TGFs are rare, the consequences of a direct hit by one of these flashes to a plane full of people are significant. The crew and passengers could receive a very high, sudden dose of dangerous radiation, possibly enough to cause immediate radiation sickness and a significant risk of cancer later in life.  An unsolved and interesting problem in atmospheric physics regarding to TGFs is how, why, and when TGFs are produced. The research team seeks understanding of how the gamma-rays get as bright as they do and why (fortunately) they only happen in maybe one out of a thousand lightning flashes based on their current understanding of the ``building blocks'' of a TGF and how high-energy radiation might naturally happen during lightning. The investigation will potentially enable the team to predict involvement of TGFs in lightning flashes that interact with aircraft and provide valuable information on aviation risks for public safety. <br/><br/>In this project, the research team will deploy a number of gamma-ray detectors (previously constructed under funding from NSF, NASA, and the Air Force) to ground-based sites, aircraft, and high-altitude balloons in order to gather new data on TGFs in places they have been seen before, such as the western coast of Japan in winter, summer thunderstorms in Florida, and the eyewalls of hurricanes.  Each site and the method of observation have been chosen for measurements of TGFs close to their production locations. One of the key observations will be how bright TGFs can get and how faint they get. Currently temporal variations of TGF radiation intensity predicted by leading models have significant uncertainty. To address this uncertainty with consideration of a possible series of rapid bursts of radiation intensity with time, the fast response detector of plastic scintillators for observing each gamma-ray interaction will be used to determine the correct model physics. Combining measurements of lightning characteristics (mostly via radio emission) with complementary meteorological data, the team would be able to understand not only the detailed behavior of lightning that produces TGFs, but also lightning data of similar high quality for situations where a TGF did not get produced, which is equally important to understand.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meeting organizers will advertise broadly to groups not typically associated with aquatic ecology conferences (e.g., civil engineers, social scientists, etc.) and provide financial support to individuals from diverse disciplines and with diverse personal experiences. While plenary speakers will introduce important concepts and two poster sessions will provide opportunities to share contemporary research and management frameworks, four case studies will serve as the foundation for exchanging ideas among attendees. Participants will progress through single-discipline, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary groups to generate management plans through a structured process that includes site visits to ground-truth plan concepts. Ancillary activities including a social science experiment examining the benefits of multidisciplinary collaborations for addressing complex environmental problems will increase the intellectual merit of the meeting.

However, youth employment in the U.S. has dropped significantly over the past four decades, and there are currently over 13.5 million young adults ages 18-24 who are out of school and out of work. Being disconnected at this critical age has major risks for chronic unemployment and lifetime lower earnings and costs local economies and tax dollars an estimated $940 k per youth.

These diseases affect more than 120 million people and cost more than $580 B in the US.  Standard treatments for many of these diseases have variable efficacy and serious side effects, calling for novel therapeutic approaches.  While microbiome therapies (MBTs) have proven useful as a new class of therapeutics, their efficacy is largely affected by highly variable gut microbiota composition between individuals. Since there is no reliable approach to personalize MBTs prior to administration, MBTs are developed as a one-size-fits-all treatment.

As a result, MBTs are emerging as a new paradigm in medicine to fight various diseases by modulating the gut microbiota. A primary challenge, however, is the highly variable compositional and functional landscape of the gut microbiome across individuals. Despite extensive research on gut microbiome medicine over that past several years, a reliable and robust technology has proven elusive due to many impediments. The biggest challenge in personalization of MBTs is the lack of a mechanistic or statistical link between individual-specific omics data and MBT-gut interactions.

Exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life is highly recommended. While U.S. breastfeeding initiation rates exceed 80%, only 25% of women are able to reach the six-month goal. The leading cause of premature breastfeeding cessation is maternal anxiety about milk supply exacerbated by the absence of an accurate, inexpensive, and convenient means to assess infant milk intake. The current standard-of-care, weighing an infant before and after feeding, requires an expensive clinical scale to detect a 1-2% weight change, trained staff, tight swaddling of the infant, careful operation, and regular calibration. Even then, it?s still a tedious exercise and thus does not provide a quality representative measure of daily milk intake. There is therefore a need for a ?thermometer for breastfeeding? ? an accurate, easy-to-use device to be used for multiple feedings in both clinical and home settings. The technology developed in this project can be used for rapid identification and intervention for infants at high risk of feeding problems.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop and validate the accuracy of a low-cost wearable patch measuring milk volume and suck patterns in real time. The patch operates by detecting changes in the shape and electrical properties of the breast and can be used for 1-12 feedings per day. Data are reported to a mobile app for tracking and analysis, as well as integration with other key metrics of infant feeding and growth. Several patch configurations will be built and tested to optimize the design and analysis algorithm.

Despite this essential role, few techniques exist to study the dynamic interactions between cells within lymph nodes. Additionally, the structure of the lymph node is so unique that the complex architecture prevents drugs from penetrating into the lymph node to target viruses, bacteria, and metastatic cancer cells that collect there causing infection. Current methods do not allow straightforward testing of immune cell interactions and drug transport a lymph node without animal testing. This CAREER project will develop a microfluidics device to culture an entire lymph node to observe and quantify cell behaviors and interactions in real time. In addition to answering fundamental questions as to how the immune system activates, this lymph node model has potential broad applications to study 1) chronic infection and inflammation, 2) cancer metastasis to the lymph node, and 3) drug delivery strategies for chemotherapeutic and antiretroviral therapies for cancer and HIV treatment. It can also serve as a screening platform for immune response to foreign materials and/or transplant rejection. The complementary education plan focuses on cross-training students in microphysiological engineering and immune biology at the undergraduate and graduate level.  Through a partnership with Delaware public school teachers, middle and high school curricular materials will be developed and implemented on immune system physiology, vaccine function, and bioengineering for broad dissemination of these important and advanced concepts into the secondary school system.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to develop a new class of microfluidic ex vivo organ culture platforms to serve as a microphysiological system to mechanistically interrogate physiology, development, and remodeling in a multicellular context with native tissue architecture.  Toward this goal, the research objective of this CAREER project is to develop an ex vivo lymph node (LN) platform for extended culture and to validate proper adaptive immune system response, cell trafficking, and drug pharmacokinetics, which will enable mechanistic interrogation of LN physiology, in a multicellular context, with native tissue architecture and circulatory flows.  The Research Plan is organized under two Aims.   The FIRST Aim is to create a framework for non-invasive monitoring LN health and physiology over extended culture (21 days) in an ex vivo LNChip microfluidic platform.  Individual LNs will be dissected from pig tissue and the afferent and efferent lymphatic and vascular vessels will be mobilized for cannulation and connection to the microfluidic platform, which enables precise control and measurement of the cellular and fluid input and output of the LN.  Rigorous assessment and quantification of organ health will be determined with ?minimally invasive? longitudinal measures and end-point assays. These data will be coupled with a computational model of transport in the LN to create a framework for ?non-invasive? monitoring organ health from temporal analyte concentrations in the efferent lymphatic and venous flows.  Modeling the creation, degradation, and transport of factors that are indicators of cellular stress, apoptosis and necrosis will enable monitoring the health of the LN from measurements made from these input and output flows without disturbing the LN. The SECOND Aim is to assess key cellular interactions, cell trafficking, and drug pharmacokinetics in a LNChip platform with an embedded window for longitudinal real-time imaging, with the goal of confirming that the platform demonstrates immune cell trafficking from both vascular and lymph pathways as documented in the literature and has similar transport characteristics for small molecules and drugs during culture. For trafficking studies, fluorescently labeled cells will be recirculated through either the vascular or lymphatic networks, and the number and locations of cells will be quantified in each fluid network and within the LN itself. Incorporation of a glass ""window"" into the LN will allow for real-time imaging and timelapse cell tracking. This will enable studies focusing on the dynamics of cell trafficking in a physiologically relevant microenvironment. T cell activation assays will serve as confirmation of normal function following culture and transport studies (passive molecules of varying sizes and drug) in a LN will be performed to assess the transport of species between vascular and lymphatic networks and throughout the lobule.  To broaden impact, in addition to the fundamental knowledge of LN physiology directly assessed in this project and the impact that such an ex vivo culture system would have, the investigator?s lab will set up a website to share the numerous tricks and techniques developed that enable cannulation of small vessels, organ preparation, harvest, and culture, and the design of pump systems needed to sustain this class of microfluidic device. The website will serve as a source for how-to videos, device designs, and resource sharing around development of tissue fluidic connectors for the global scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By applying plant (or animal) sterols that are final products of sterol biosynthesis in an appropriate encapsulation agent to germinating seeds, the exogenous sterols inhibit seed sterol production, thus causing a decrease in total sterols similar to the effects of gene inactivation.  Application of exogenous sterols phenocopies or mimics the effects of mutation of several different sterol biosynthetic genes, reducing complete germination, causing changes in plant vasculature, and producing severe dwarfing when given during seed germination. This effect is broad spectrum, affecting both monocots and dicots. Furthermore, herbicide application to plants that have already germinated and are actively growing experience minimal or beneficial effects on growth. The beneficial effects include slight stunting of stems, which may make crops more resistant to wind and hail damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The seasonal timing of biological events such as leaf out, flowering, and seed production is especially critical for forest wildflowers that rely on high light in the spring, before trees leaf out and reduce light to the forest floor. New research suggests the timing of leaf out of overstory trees may shift faster than understory wildflowers in response to warmer spring temperatures. Such mismatches in leaf out timing of different plant species could reduce wildflower populations and affect forest diversity and productivity. The early leaf out times and dense foliage of nonnative, invasive shrubs could further reduce light levels for native wildflowers. This project explores how warming temperatures may cause a mismatch in lifecycle events of trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Specifically, the project measures whether trees, shrubs, and flowers respond differently to temperature cues, whether this mismatch is a global phenomenon, and how this affects the ability of wildflowers to grow and reproduce. This project connects the public interest in forests to environmental variability and invasive species. The public can access the results through popular media, public lectures, and social media. The project team will develop training for museum educators so they can infuse themes of forest change into exhibits and conversations with museum visitors. In collaboration with museum educators, the project will host K-12 teacher workshops to integrate forest monitoring and local examples of environmental variability into school curricula. <br/><br/>Direct measurements of the consequences of environment-induced phenological mismatches between interacting species are rare, and disruptions in non-trophic competitive interactions between plant species are often overlooked. In addition, related impacts of species invasions are not well integrated into phenological studies. The impacts of these phenological disruptions may be contributing to widely-observed population declines and poor performance of species that weakly respond to warming temperatures. This project will uniquely combine historical records (observations of Henry David Thoreau), contemporary phenological monitoring, museum herbarium collections, and field experiments to document and understand ecological mismatches between forest trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Field shading experiments will simulate effects of environmental variability, species invasions, and ecological mismatches on wildflower performance. Field and growth chamber experiments will test mechanisms determining leaf-out phenology. Thousands of recently digitized herbarium specimens will be leveraged to quantify how overstory-understory temporal mismatch varies across temporal, climatic, and biogeographic gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As pain management devices dominate this market, the proposed technology could enter the $1.5 B foot and ankle pain sector as a new treatment option for the millions of people suffering from this debilitating condition. Electrostimulation has been widely used for pain management, but integration with a wearable system has not yet been widely adopted.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a neurostimulation device that can reduce chronic foot and ankle pain in nurses and assist in muscle recovery for athletes. The invention is a knee-high sock that delivers electrical impulses to the muscles within the foot for reducing chronic pain and inflammation. The sock is removable, reusable and all electrical components are integrated with the plantar area of the sock. When the user experiences pain, nerve stimulation is activated via their smartphone that can provide instant pain relief. The user also may program the smartphone to automatically deliver neurostimulation if they expect to be standing for long periods. In addition, the sock features a shock-absorbing insole that can automatically adjust the compression of the fabric based on the current circumference of the foot.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These chemical compounds are often unique to certain plant parts in different plant groups. This project seeks to understand the evolution of plant-derived chemical compounds and how these compounds promote plant diversity. To address these questions, the project will focus on the plants within the Caryophyllales, a group that includes cacti and many alpine and arctic plants known for extraordinary adaptations to warm, dry, or cold environments. Many Caryophyllales species produce unusually large amounts of diverse compounds derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Due to inherent biochemical trade-offs, the production of these tyrosine-derived compounds may come at the expense of other compounds derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. We will study the balance of the production of these two amino acids and its effect on the production of myriad compounds important in UV shielding, pollination, and herbivore deterrence. The work will inform the biotechnological production of natural plant pigments and will help to elucidate biosynthetic pathways of a number of high-value plant-derived chemicals with pharmaceutical value. The collaborative US-UK team will provide multidisciplinary training opportunities for students and post-doctoral scholars in genetic and biochemical methods in an evolutionary context. Workshops at professional society meetings, a K-12 summer camp module, and multiple public outreach modules will bring these concepts to the public and highlight the relationship between biodiversity and high-value plant chemical compounds. <br/><br/>This study will perform an extensive survey to establish the occurrence and distribution of key tyrosine- and phenylalanine-derived metabolites in 600 species across Caryophyllales; examine the association of these tyrosine-derived metabolic traits with organismal adaptation and diversification patterns; and determine the evolutionary genetic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites. New tools will be developed to model the hierarchical nature of metabolite evolution and will be made available to the broader community of scientists. This project will comprehensively describe the extent of tyrosine-enriched metabolism in Caryophyllales, define the degree to which these metabolites are associated with organismal diversification patterns across Caryophyllales, and resolve the evolutionary assembly of the genetic pathways underlying complex tyrosine-derived metabolic traits.

Current DCNs use fixed cables to connect servers, leading to high cabling complexity and an inflexible topology that makes it difficult to efficiently provide the computation power across  many applications.  This project will explore the integration of Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) technology in DCNs to utilize the flexibility of wireless technologies to establish configurable on-demand links, and thus solve load hotspot and cabling complexity problems simultaneously. In addition to advancing the research in this area, this project will provide the opportunity to establish a network research track in the Department of Computer Science at Appalachian State University and will serve the needs of the diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will explore the design space of efficient, configurable OWC DCN topologies.

Despite considerable efforts, the current recovery rate of these searches is 3% annually.  The innovation proposed in this project will significantly improve success rates and allow larger searches to be conducted more efficiently and at a lower cost. The technology uses a spectroscopic probe that is pushed into the ground  to detect the presence of human remains with 99% accuracy even after the body has been buried for decades.  It improves on the current use of cadaver dogs and ground penetrating radar.  This project will create U.S. jobs not only in the field unit manufacturing, but in service sectors associated with forensic work.  This project strongly aligns with forensic agency mission statements (i.e., Department of POW/MIA Accounting Agency) and supports the SBIR mission and program goals.

Detection is done in real time by using a mobile robotic survey unit employing a near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic probe system. The spectral peaks characteristic of the adipocere formed during human cadaver decomposition are distinct and can be discriminated from the background soil chemistry. Sophisticated software algorithms are used to analyze the chemical composition of the soil under a wide range of soil types, weather conditions, and other environmental factors.  Data are constantly accumulated in a specialized knowledge base capable of handling spatial recognition, calibration of sensors, and the analysis of spectra employing machine-learning protocols.  The goal of the SBIR Phase I is to engineer the original prototype to the specific needs of forensic case-work.

It is well recognized that dispersal in space can provide protection for hosts against infection, however many organisms can also disperse in time through the process of dormancy. Dormancy reflects the ability of an individual to enter a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. It is a strategy that has evolved numerous times across the tree of life, but is particularly prevalent among microorganisms. While it is well known that dormancy allows populations to persist in the face of harsh environmental conditions like thermal stress and starvation, far less is known about whether dormancy can provide protection against infection by parasites. This project will advance multiple fields of biology through the integration of mathematical theory, laboratory evolution experiments, and bioinformatic analysis of genomic data collected from a range of ecosystems around the world. The project will engage elementary students and the public through a combination of K-5 classroom activities and an exhibit in a public science festival. Educational impacts include immersing students from diverse ages and backgrounds in teaching modules and research experiences that use physical and computer models to emphasize the scale and nature of microbial interactions.<br/><br/>The central premise of the research project is that dormancy is an important life-history strategy that modifies the evolutionary ecology of host-parasite interactions. The project addresses this premise, first, by developing theory to assess how fluctuations caused by host-parasite dynamics influence the emergence and maintenance of dormancy beyond classical expectations. Second, experimental evolution trials with a bacteria-virus (i.e., phage) system will be used to test predictions about how the preservation of genetic and phenotypic diversity in dormant pools (i.e., seed banks) affects the rate and mode of host-parasite coevolution. Finally, a combination of informatics and direct molecular manipulation will be used to test the ability of parasites to overcome a dormancy refuge by modifying host behavior via a novel arms-race strategy. Bridging major themes in life history and population biology, the research will advance the study of dormancy and how it alters the long-term ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TGFs are extraordinarily powerful bursts of gamma radiation; gamma-rays are particles of invisible light, similar to x-rays but in this case with energies up to about 100 times higher than the x-rays used by doctors and dentists. Although TGFs are rare, the consequences of a direct hit by one of these flashes to a plane full of people are significant. The crew and passengers could receive a very high, sudden dose of dangerous radiation, possibly enough to cause immediate radiation sickness and a significant risk of cancer later in life.  An unsolved and interesting problem in atmospheric physics regarding to TGFs is how, why, and when TGFs are produced. The research team seeks understanding of how the gamma-rays get as bright as they do and why (fortunately) they only happen in maybe one out of a thousand lightning flashes based on their current understanding of the ``building blocks'' of a TGF and how high-energy radiation might naturally happen during lightning. The investigation will potentially enable the team to predict involvement of TGFs in lightning flashes that interact with aircraft and provide valuable information on aviation risks for public safety. <br/><br/>In this project, the research team will deploy a number of gamma-ray detectors (previously constructed under funding from NSF, NASA, and the Air Force) to ground-based sites, aircraft, and high-altitude balloons in order to gather new data on TGFs in places they have been seen before, such as the western coast of Japan in winter, summer thunderstorms in Florida, and the eyewalls of hurricanes.  Each site and the method of observation have been chosen for measurements of TGFs close to their production locations. One of the key observations will be how bright TGFs can get and how faint they get. Currently temporal variations of TGF radiation intensity predicted by leading models have significant uncertainty. To address this uncertainty with consideration of a possible series of rapid bursts of radiation intensity with time, the fast response detector of plastic scintillators for observing each gamma-ray interaction will be used to determine the correct model physics. Combining measurements of lightning characteristics (mostly via radio emission) with complementary meteorological data, the team would be able to understand not only the detailed behavior of lightning that produces TGFs, but also lightning data of similar high quality for situations where a TGF did not get produced, which is equally important to understand.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At their core, applications rely on statistical inference whereby meaning is extracted from noisy data. This is challenging due not only to the sheer scale, but also the complex underlying structure that must often be exploited. The two basic resources for carrying out an inference task are (1) data, which can vary in quality and quantity; and (2) computation. There appears to be a trade-off: The minimum amount of data needed by computationally infeasible algorithms is often far less than what is required by all known computationally efficient algorithms. As this trade-off is poorly understood, the objective of the project is to create the mathematical foundations for reasoning about the optimal computational and statistical efficiency of algorithms for structured inference problems. Significant societal impact may be possible via new fundamental insights relevant to basic procedures and methods used across business, economics, medical technology, social network analysis, genetics, neuroscience, and many other domains. Furthermore, as part of a synergistic research and education plan, the project will take a multi-faceted approach to STEM education, including: (1) mentorship of both undergraduate and graduate students in research; (2) outreach to both high school and undergraduate groups; (3) creation of a collaborative research experience for undergraduate students on topics related to the project; and (4) development of new courses at MIT, both at the advanced undergraduate and PhD levels.<br/> <br/>The project aims to develop a comprehensive average-case complexity theory of statistical inference, analogous to the classical P versus NP theory for combinatorial problems, characterizing when inference is or is not efficiently solvable and showing strong equivalences between problems. The bulk of the technical approach is based on developing new techniques for average-case reductions that yield precise relationships between different problems. Average-case reductions transform one problem into another, implying a comparison between the data and computation resources required by each. In addition to characterizing fundamental limits, the approach pursued in this project will result in algorithms and insights. By creating a web of reductions between problems, it will be possible to translate algorithms for one problem into algorithms for other problems.

Recently, strong evidence indicates that most lipid transport occurs with the help of lipid transport proteins that can facilitate the formation of organelle contacts known as membrane contact sites. The oxysterol binding homologue (Osh) proteins of yeast are an example of lipid transport proteins that form membrane contact sites and serve as an excellent model for lipid exchange between organelles. Since cells can be used to produce chemicals for commercial use, understanding lipid exchange and ways to modify it could improve production of chemicals. This project will provide scientific training for researchers with focused recruitment from underrepresented groups. Project concepts and results will be used in educational outreach for minority-serving high school summer programs, courses, and developing hands-on protein engineering activities for the general public. <br/><br/>Osh proteins were originally thought to transport sterols but have recently been shown to be important in the transport of signaling lipids, such as phosphatidylinositols. This project integrates experimental and computational techniques to elucidate membrane contact site formation and probe lipid exchange by first studying membrane-binding regions of Osh proteins and then the mechanism the full-length protein uses to form membrane contact sites. The binding of the lipid-packing sensor of Osh proteins to model membranes (planar and curved) will be probed using enhanced sampling simulations, neutron diffraction, and high-resolution field-cycling NMR. Other domains of Osh4 interacting with membranes will be studied with a focus on how this protein might conformationally change to facilitate membrane contact sites. Ultimately, the mechanism of the full-length Osh4 protein to form membrane contact sites and lipid transfer will be probed by developing new computational tools for dual-membrane binding and the use of field-cycling NMR and fluorescence techniques.

Because of this organizational and research efforts are directed toward improving planning, immediate response, and resiliency against natural disasters. However, those efforts are often siloed based on the type of disaster (e.g. wildfires vs. landslides). An additional challenge is understanding and using the explosion of technological capabilities that provide so many new data sources, including physical (e.g., sensors, internet-of-things tools, drones), cyber (e.g., hazard databases, open government data), and social (e.g. microblog streams) data of various modalities (text/images/videos). This workshop will identify areas of future research and inter-organizational collaboration that are needed to transform big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning tools into actionable knowledge for all types of disaster management.  <br/><br/>This workshop will bring together 30-40 stakeholders including practitioners (e.g. first responders, local/state/federal government), academia (including fields of computer, social, physical sciences. and engineering), and industry (for-profit, non-profit) to discuss the information and data technology needs for all phases of disaster resilience, from planning to response to recovery. The workshop will identify major research challenges / opportunities and the potential for the research areas to transition to practical use in the short term. These insights will help describe the potential for this area to serve as a future topic for the NSF Convergence Accelerator. Big data harnessed with artificial intelligence (AI) tools are needed to improve productivity, efficiency, and decision making in disaster preparedness and response, but big data and AI are also relevant to many other challenges our society is facing. Therefore, this workshop should also provide an example of how disparate data and tools may be integrated for planning and decision support. This effort builds upon investments made by other programs at NSF, including Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP), Interdisciplinary Research in Hazards and Disasters (Hazard-SEES), and Smart & Connected Communities (S&CC), as well as investments by many other U.S. federal agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the biggest impacts of vegetation is trapping and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The vast Amazon rainforest makes a significant contribution to this carbon storage function. However, the Amazon forest is being threatened by recent changes to climate, which is making droughts stronger and more frequent. A big question is whether the Amazon will be resilient to these droughts, or whether they will slow forest growth and kill trees, which would release carbon. A significant challenge is the lack of information about a large portion of the Amazon forest?about 30%?with shallow water tables, where trees live in an environment of excess water. In these water-logged forests, tree growth is slow because soil conditions are poor for tree roots. Here, drought could actually be beneficial to trees by reducing this water-logging. On the other hand, these forests have roots that grow close to the soil surface and require wet conditions. In this case, strong droughts that last a long time dry the upper soil and could reduce growth more, killing more trees than in forests with well-drained soils. This project will answer questions about the role of belowground water sources as an important control on response of tropical forest to drought. Data about forest growth and carbon dioxide exchange will be made available to the broader research community. This project will also help train students in how to measure forests, and provide information about tropical forests to the public.<br/><br/>This project will measure forest canopy response to drought at sites in the Brazilian Amazon. The approach is to unify field ecology with remote observation of ecosystems from canopy towers and satellites. Canopy towers constructed in this project?representing the first of their kind in water-logged soils of the interior Amazon?provide detailed information about tree growth. The capacity of the forest canopy for photosynthesis will be measured as well as leaf demography and phenology. This new knowledge will be combined with networks of existing canopy towers in deep water table depth sites, satellite images spanning the Amazon, data on tree growth and death from a network of forest surveys, and detailed measurements of soil water and other environmental factors. This project will build an accurate new understanding of the factors that impact forest carbon cycling, while contrasting water-logged with well-drained soil responses. A data-based model of ecosystem structure and function will offer a quantitative accounting of the contribution of these water-logged forests in the Amazon to climate change responses.

These sensors are easy to use, portable, and can provide rapid test results. Most of the current technologies require water sample collection from sites, followed by tests in external labs. This technology can be used for residential and industrial applications.  It can be used for monitoring water quality in swimming pools, residential and commercial aquariums, agricultural water run-off, water body with algae bloom, houses known to have lead service lines, industrial effluent, and breweries.  Additionally, longer term development of the technology may enable integration with a plumbing system/water filtration system for automated monitoring and added reliability.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project has developed an electrochemical sensor using a screen-printed electrode modified with different functional nanomaterials to detect concentrations of dissolved heavy metals, phosphate and pH in water.  In addition to graphene, functionalized nanomaterials and conducting polymer nanocomposites deposited on the electrode surface are a reliable approach to enhance the selectivity and affinity of target molecules of analysis. The nanocomposite materials include reduced graphene oxide and polypyrrole to increase the electron transfer and electrode?s surface area. The functional materials for the target molecules of pH, phosphate, and heavy metals are iridium oxide, molybdate, and cysteine, respectively. By observing the potentiometric and amperometric change occurring in the electrochemical reaction at the electrode-solution interface, quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the relevant substance in water are possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event will take place in conjunction with the 2020 International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP 2020), to be held January 4-8 on Sanibel Island, Florida, and sponsored by ACM's Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI).  For over 25 years, the bi-annual GROUP conferences have been a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practice on organizational behavior, information systems, social informatics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), providing a showcase for innovative work on the development, introduction, management, deployment, and analysis of computer-based collaborative systems.  Research reports published in the GROUP conference proceedings are rigorously reviewed and widely cited.  More information is available online at https://group.acm.org/conferences/group20/.  The Doctoral Consortium focuses on participating students' doctoral dissertations and provides both an opportunity for these projects to be shaped through intellectual exchange as well as an opportunity to communicate the character of the work to a key group of early career researchers.  There are both short- and long-term benefits to the GROUP research community and to society from this workshop.  In the short term, the event will bring together the best of the next generation of researchers exploring the fields relevant to the conference, will allow the students to create a social network both among themselves and with several senior researchers, and will facilitate their enculturation into the field.  Furthermore, the workshop will provide an avenue for advanced Ph.D. students to advertise themselves and their work to conference attendees, many of whom may be hiring.  Finally, the students and faculty are anticipated to be a diverse group on several dimensions (e.g., scientific discipline, gender, institutional affiliation, underrepresented minority status), which will help broaden the students' horizons at a critical stage in their professional development.  In the longer term, the organizers expect that students who have participated in the Doctoral Consortium will give back to the community by engaging as mentors themselves to future generations of students, and that these exceptional students will be the future leaders of the GROUP community.<br/><br/>The GROUP 2020 Doctoral Consortium will begin with a full day pre-conference research-focused workshop on Sunday, January 5, followed by events integrated throughout the conference, including presentations at the posters/demos reception and a reflective wrap-up session.  The student participants will be later stage doctoral candidates primarily from the United States, and will represent a variety of disciplines including computer and information science, information systems, and communications.  Each student will present a summary of their work for public critique and will discuss currently open questions; this will help the students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are being appropriately analyzed.  The working lunch will focus on managing one's committee and learning how to ""finish well"" while the working dinner will focus on career development plans, including best strategies for the job search in academe and industry.  The goals of the workshop are to build a cohort group of young researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread across the world, to guide and shape the work of the new researchers by having experts serve as mentors and give advice, to provide encouragement and support for the selection of GROUP research topics, to make it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend a leading research conference and to illustrate for them the interrelationship and diversity of GROUP research, and in general to make the new entrants' experience at the GROUP conference enjoyable and rewarding so that they will be encouraged to return and submit to future conferences in the series.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use a group of fast-growing microorganisms that make these ingredients. The challenge will be to harvest enough of the material to make effective and affordable sunscreens. The problem is akin to trying to collect all the ""needles in a haystack"". New tools that incorporate reusable analogues to ""magnets"" for capturing and releasing the sunscreen compound will provide a novel way to get the material out of a complex mixture of broken open cells and into the sunscreens. There is a lack of genuinely non-toxic, environmentally safe sunscreens in the U.S. market today. Melanoma, the most common cancer in the U.S., is a deadly form of skin cancer directly attributable to sun damage to skin, and conventional sunscreens are under pressure because of human health concerns and possible impacts on coral reefs. This work will provide a new class of sunscreens safer for people and marine life. Unlocking the potential of this nature-designed sunscreen will improve human health and the environment.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility of using aptamers (small nucleic acids) to isolate mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from a complex mixture of compounds derived from cyanobacteria. Small molecules present challenges for aptamer development because they can be: difficult to immobilize, have multiple three-dimensional conformations, and few chemically distinguishing features. MAAs present unique challenges due to the similarity of their chemical structure with other cell lysate materials and wide variety of amino acid substitutions. This innovation entails the isolation and identification of the specific MAAs being produced, isolation of aptamers that are highly specific, and assessing process scalability. MAAs are not commercially available so reference standards will be derived from the culture broth.  These materials will be utilized as targets in aptamer selection using a proprietary single-stranded DNA library of aptamer sequences to identify suitable candidates by next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Those aptamer candidates will then be screened and evaluated using an affinity purification workflow and absorbance-based microplate assay. The end result of this work will be to establish if this is a robust and scalable affinity purification method for MAAs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This lifelong debilitating disease impacts almost 1 M US patients, and developing effective treatments requires accurate, reliable, and timely scoring. Currently, the FDA-approved primary diagnostic is the endoscopic component of the Mayo score, and clinical trials require a time-consuming, resource-constrained process of expert reading by specialized gastroenterologists. The proposed technology will serve multiple purposes: expediting the scoring process to determine patient eligibility for drug trials, measuring baseline and disease change to obtain FDA endpoints for UC drug trials, and providing insights that inform GI physicians on the effectiveness of a particular therapy for a specific patient. This system scoring ? performed in minutes, rather than days ? will improve efficiency and expedite recruitment and retention of trial participants (the greatest challenge in drug trials). With an estimated $56 M spent annually on expert reading of colonoscopy videos for drug trials, this technology would not only save time but would also significantly reduce costs. In addition, this methodology will translate into clinical care, providing community physicians with automated GI expertise and valuable insight into disease progression and patient response to therapy. Finally, this technology could be utilized as a teaching tool for medical students and GI residents. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project is designed to create an automated system for video assessment of colonoscopies taken for UC monitoring. The unique innovative factor in this research is the automated processing of all data available from colonoscopy videos to create a reliable, repeatable, efficient, and quantitative assessment of the burden of UC disease. The approach uses a combination of an effective informative frame classifier, location estimation system, and disease severity classifier to generate scoring of the entire video. Algorithms for automated, comprehensive, machine-learning-based assessment of clinically-captured videos are the foundation of the system. The project will improve (1) classification accuracy between informative vs. non-informative video frames, (2) estimation of the camera location, and (3) validate the system against a heterogenous colonoscopy video dataset from multiple clinical providers and from colonoscopes from various manufacturers. The algorithms will be optimized for an endoscopic assessment and scoring system and extended through ongoing data collection with academic partners. This project will result in a novel approach to medical video analysis using effective machine learning methods to create a practical, data-driven solution for assessment and improvement of UC care.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, Arctic shifts may trigger impacts outside of the Arctic including tropical forests turning to savannahs, monsoon systems weakening, and coral reefs becoming dominated by algae, all of which will have extensive consequences for humans across the world. Limited knowledge exists about the interconnections between the Arctic?s changing environment and socioecological systems across the world.  The diverse but uneven effects of Arctic regime shifts on ecosystems and cultural systems highlights the need for research to better understand these Arctic-global interconnections. This project gathers scientists and researchers for two workshops to address how transformations in the Arctic may affect human well-being in global environments, in light of the rapid changes undergoing in the Arctic. <br/><br/>Understanding the Arctic and global interconnections opens up new understandings of networked environmental effects and the various infrastructures through which its resources and representations are produced and circulated. As such, this research advances systems-level understanding of links between the Arctic?s rapidly changing environmental, social, and cultural systems with other regions and networks across the world. Scholars are invited to consider theory and methods for studying such interconnections through environmental, infrastructural, and social dimensions. The workshops emphasize the increasing complexity of physical infrastructures, especially energy infrastructures, and digital infrastructures in shaping knowledge of environmental transformation and mediating social adaptation to such change both within and beyond the Arctic. One outcome will be an innovative research program that responds to the research priorities of the Arctic Social Science Program and the Navigating the New Arctic Big Idea about interconnections of Arctic changing systems and global contexts.

Having this is crucial for assessing effects of candidate hardware and software technologies and for creating an environment in which flexible technologies are utilized by complementing each other?s performance and by jointly meeting the societal needs. Since the performance of many technologies of interest greatly depends on how well they are integrated over time and stakeholders (system modules), an effective framework needs to support decisions that are data-enabled and interactive over time and among different system decision makers. In this project a complex dynamical systems point of view is taken which recognizes such distributed nature of decisions and introduces novel modeling, control and protocol principles in support of system integration in time and space. In sharp contrast with the lack of theoretically-provable performance in the evolving electric power system architectures, this project explores fundamentals and takes major steps toward solving this long-overdue problem. The most important impact will be on the way electric power industry architectures evolve. In particular, the project will catalyze the adoption of data-enabled decision making and automation. Notably, this approach will help educate students to think about emerging electric energy systems as complex dynamical systems for which much innovation is needed and possible. Results of this research will be disseminated through a workshop on design and control of complex energy systems. <br/><br/> The next generation Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) can evolve based on protocols defined according to a dynamic monitoring, and decision system (DyMonDS) framework envisioned in this project. Such framework is crucial for assessing effects of candidate hardware and software technologies and for creating an environment in which technologies are integrated and utilized by complementing each other?s performance and by jointly meeting the societal needs. In this project a complex dynamical systems point of view is taken which recognizes such distributed nature of decisions and introduces novel modeling, control and protocol principles in support of temporal and spatial system integration. The main question is how to ensure stability and efficiency of these systems without increasing complexity of information management and consequent implications on cyber-security. Once principles for answering this complex question are formalized, it becomes possible to support selection of ?right? technologies and for utilizing them based on data obtained through sensing, communications and control.  To establish such principles and not radically change the industry, this project introduces a generalization of today?s Automatic Generation Control by the Balancing Authorities (BAs) which is fundamentally cooperative in nature.  The interactions between BAs are managed by each area compensating its own Area Control Error (ACE) which is the net power imbalance contributed by both internal power deviations from schedules and by the tie-line flow deviations into the BA. This is a great example of distributed control through cooperation based on simple protocols of balancing ACE.  In this project the ACE is generalized into a notion of an interaction variable (intVar) associated with each intelligent Balancing Authority (iBA). Notably, an intVar has a physical interpretation in terms of power and rate of change of power, but it is not restricted to the assumptions made by the industry today, and it allows for different unconventional architectures, such as small iBAs nested within the existing BAs.  iBAs can be components or subsystems of diverse spatial and temporal granularity, and are technology agnostic; their specifications, modeling and interactive multi-layered control are in terms of an intVar common to all. This project targets specifically principles for protocols and enhanced standards for a general DyMonDS framework so that following this framework one can catalyze performance enhancements based on the PI?s recent finding that the intVar dynamics can be interpreted in terms of rates of exergy (potential to perform useful work) and anergy (wasted work).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The initial focus is to drastically cut the time to market, and development costs of functional organic coatings, which are under both regulatory and consumer pressure to develop custom solutions without loss of performance. An adjacent market is composites development, heavily dependent on fillers for its needs for lightweight materials. The computer-aided engineering market will be approximately $13 billion by 2025, while the industrial coatings market by itself is currently worth $115 billion globally. The benefits of these high-throughput solutions for development of advanced polymeric materials include reduced toxins and energy consumption.    <br/><br/>This I-Corps project leverages the use of molecular markers to develop a novel engineering design software for functional coatings. Using machine learning to correlate molecular markers to percolation threshold, and thereby failure through barrier ingress, the software would provide a unique method to down-select formulations to the most promising subset. The ?virtual lab? approach is akin to high-throughput drug discovery. Current methods in coatings development fail to provide a physico-chemical or molecular underpinning to field performance and eventual failure. The design of experiments for coating assessment and formulation development commonly utilizes statistical software. This separation from mechanistic understanding often results in trial and error approaches, based largely on chemical intuition; furthermore, this leads to multiple accelerated aging runs that add significant lead time for field deployment of a given formulation as sub-optimal solutions. Developed software would provide a significant leap in design that translates to tailored polymeric advanced materials beyond functional coatings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It arises naturally in a wide range of real-life settings such as dispute resolution, seats in courses/schools, computing-resources management, airport-traffic management, and spectrum allocation. Competitive equilibrium is a central solution concept in economics to study markets, and due to its remarkable fairness and efficiency properties, it is also one of the most preferred mechanisms for solving fair-division problems even though there may be no money involved in the latter case. With the advent of the Internet and the influence of computing systems on all parts of modern life, applications of fair division have grown immensely with a plethora of variants based on utility models, allocation constraints, and new fairness notions. The resulting equilibrium problems require complex constraints and generalizations so that most of the tools and techniques developed for markets in the last several decades do not seem to be applicable, and hence the corresponding fair-division problems remain unresolved. This project aims to explore many of these fundamental open questions. The project will support and engage both undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds and integrate the findings into multiple courses the investigator teaches.<br/><br/>Unlike markets, in fair-division problems items are both goods (e.g., cake) and bads (e.g., chores), and allocation needs to satisfy additional constraints, e.g., students are assigned to exactly one school. The main research thrust of the project is to understand the structure and computational complexity of competitive equilibrium of (i) goods and bads, (ii) constrained allocation, (iii) divisible and indivisible items, and their various combinations. The challenges posed are of fundamental importance not only in fair division but also in equilibrium computation, mechanism design, and continuous and discrete optimization. Work on this project will bring significant algorithmic and complexity-theoretic insights into problems from these diverse areas. The techniques developed will contribute to the burgeoning literature on approximation, non-convex optimization, mathematical programming, scheduling, and auction theory, and will open up new avenues for further exploration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extensive fields of seeps, largely releasing the same methane gas that we use to heat our homes, have recently been found about a hundred miles east of North Carolina?s Cape Hatteras at water depths as shallow as 300 feet. It is estimated that at least tens of thousands of these hydrocarbon-rich seeps occur on continental margins around the world. The seeps, usually seen as large rising plumes by sonar systems on research ships, inject huge, but poorly quantified, amounts of methane into overlying waters as they rise through the water column. A primary question is how much of the methane, a potent greenhouse gas, actually reaches the atmosphere. This question is the subject of much current research funded by several Federal research agencies including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Oceanographers believe that the methane (and other gases included in the bubble streams such as ethane and propane) are either transported away by ocean currents or consumed by microorganisms specially adapted to live with hydrocarbons as their main carbon source. This proposal seeks to determine the importance of microbial consumption in controlling methane distributions in the deep ocean and how the consumption rates depend on concentrations of methane, oxygen and other chemicals, as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Previous studies in laboratories aboard research ship using samples returned to the surface suggest that microbial consumption of methane from the seeps may lag for a week after its injection into the water column and thus that physical dispersion by currents may dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, other measurements suggest that there is no lag before aggressive microbial oxidation of injected methane begins. We have proposed to conduct in situ measurements of microbial methane consumption and related microbial community structure in bottom waters at several coastal and continental margin sites off the North Carolina coast and the northern Gulf of Mexico, where numerous natural seeps have also been observed. We will use new technologies developed after the release of massive quantities of methane during the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf. The sites offer varying concentrations of methane and other chemical and physical conditions such as oxygen concentrations and temperature that will allow us to test specific hypotheses about the role of microbial processes. Through performing the experiments with instruments right on the seafloor next to the seeps we can remove much of the uncertainty surrounding previous shipboard measurements. We will use newly developed seafloor landers equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and the microbial community for the presence of methane-consuming methanotrophs and their activity using advanced genomics techniques that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations. Successful collection of in situ methane consumption rate data and associated microbial community changes should prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and bottom waters impacted by accidental hydrocarbon releases.<br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project will gain critical skills in laboratory and field settings and will also benefit from frequent interactions with established researchers from diverse fields. Team members will participate in hands-on undergraduate education and training through developing individualized research projects leading to honors theses, presentations at national meetings and excellent graduate school placements. Graduate and undergraduates will also participate in K-12 science outreach efforts that help to attract and inform the next generation of oceanographers. The team will work with the University of North Carolina Morehead Planetarium and Science Center and participate directly in the North Carolina Science Festival. Through media contacts made from TED talks, exciting results will be broadly disseminated to the public. The project will have immediate relevance for understanding microbially mediated responses to hydrocarbon inputs from accidental releases along the Southeast Atlantic margin where oil and gas exploration are a constant topic of state and national policy discussions. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of recently discovered gas seeps along the continental margin offshore of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina plus thousands in the northern Gulf of Mexico, inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying shelf and slope waters through dissolution of rising bubble plumes. The fate of the methane is largely controlled by a balance between microbial oxidation and advective transport away from seep sources. The efficacy of microbial oxidation likely depends on concentrations of methane, oxygen and ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Recent shipboard aerobic methane oxidation rate (AMOR) measurements suggest that microbial consumption of seep methane may lag for a week and thus physical dispersion could dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, methane stable carbon isotopic measurements in bottom waters suggest that there is no lag before aggressive oxidation of injected methane begins. We propose to conduct in situ measurements of AMOR while simultaneously investigating its microbial drivers at representative North Carolina and Gulf of Mexico continental margin sites featuring numerous active bubble seeps. These sites offer varying concentrations of methane and DIN; performing the experiments in situ will remove much of the uncertainty of shipboard rates. We will conduct the measurements utilizing newly developed benthic lander systems equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week AMOR measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, DIN and the microbial community for the presence of methanotrophs (through metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations.<br/><br/>The project will test key hypotheses about deep-sea methane dynamics including determining if there are significant lags in microbial responses after exposure to elevated methane concentrations, determining the relationships of AMOR to methane and DIN concentrations and investigating the response times and magnitude of methanotrophs to spatial and temporal variability in methane concentration. Successful collection of in situ AMOR and associated microbial community data will prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and accidental hydrocarbon releases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project integrates a research program with a new informal education program to enhance both the scientific and public understanding of evolutionary and planetary processes that contribute to species distribution. The research component of this project will assess the importance of evolutionary history in niche modeling that estimates species distribution, with the aim of improving the approach used to select variable environmental layers used in these models. The ability to more accurately predict species distribution under both present and future climate scenarios is essential for identifying and understanding the habitats of species at risk of extinction, modeling the spread of introduced species or medically important invertebrates that can transmit disease, and much more. The findings from the research will be incorporated into the new informal education program that teaches biogeography under a planetarium dome. This program also will leverage the global efforts that have amassed over 1.3 billion specimen records worldwide, as well as technological advances in planetarium software, to visualize biodiversity data in an immersive and dynamic setting. This novel outlet to broadcast digitized data will transform how institutions equipped with planetariums communicate biodiversity data and will create endless opportunities to develop new programs for sharing biodiversity research with the public. Improved public understanding of these complex scientific concepts can facilitate changes in attitudes to the impact of environmental change through increased awareness of the connectivity between planetary processes and life on Earth.<br/><br/>A combined systematic and phylogeographic study of Australian dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) will be used to assess the importance of evolutionary history in environmental niche modeling. This model-group contains both a relictual Gondwanan and a younger Indomalayan clade that will be assessed in a phylogenetic and ecological framework to explore the heritability of environmental tolerance in closely-related but biogeographically distinct taxa. The evolution of niche dynamics for these biogeographically distinct faunas will be assessed through comparative analysis of niche models, predicted niche occupancy profiles and disparity through time plots. Findings will inform environmental layers selection for future analyses and improve the understanding of biotic and abiotic factors that contribute to species distribution. Beyond informing a key question in evolutionary biology, these results will be integrated into the new planetarium program that aims to improve public scientific literacy relating to species' evolution, ecology and planetary change.

Among the variety of geometric structures that are studied in this field, curves, surfaces and more generally manifolds are both very natural objects but also particularly challenging to process and analyze due to the non-canonical structure of the corresponding shape spaces. This has in part hindered the development and effectiveness of shape analysis frameworks for such data, if compared for instance to the more widely studied case of images. This project attempts to bridge a few of these important gaps, both on the theoretical and computational side and develop new scalable algorithms for morphological analysis adapted to the growing size and complexity of real datasets.

Extensive fields of seeps, largely releasing the same methane gas that we use to heat our homes, have recently been found about a hundred miles east of North Carolina?s Cape Hatteras at water depths as shallow as 300 feet. It is estimated that at least tens of thousands of these hydrocarbon-rich seeps occur on continental margins around the world. The seeps, usually seen as large rising plumes by sonar systems on research ships, inject huge, but poorly quantified, amounts of methane into overlying waters as they rise through the water column. A primary question is how much of the methane, a potent greenhouse gas, actually reaches the atmosphere. This question is the subject of much current research funded by several Federal research agencies including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Oceanographers believe that the methane (and other gases included in the bubble streams such as ethane and propane) are either transported away by ocean currents or consumed by microorganisms specially adapted to live with hydrocarbons as their main carbon source. This proposal seeks to determine the importance of microbial consumption in controlling methane distributions in the deep ocean and how the consumption rates depend on concentrations of methane, oxygen and other chemicals, as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Previous studies in laboratories aboard research ship using samples returned to the surface suggest that microbial consumption of methane from the seeps may lag for a week after its injection into the water column and thus that physical dispersion by currents may dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, other measurements suggest that there is no lag before aggressive microbial oxidation of injected methane begins. We have proposed to conduct in situ measurements of microbial methane consumption and related microbial community structure in bottom waters at several coastal and continental margin sites off the North Carolina coast and the northern Gulf of Mexico, where numerous natural seeps have also been observed. We will use new technologies developed after the release of massive quantities of methane during the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf. The sites offer varying concentrations of methane and other chemical and physical conditions such as oxygen concentrations and temperature that will allow us to test specific hypotheses about the role of microbial processes. Through performing the experiments with instruments right on the seafloor next to the seeps we can remove much of the uncertainty surrounding previous shipboard measurements. We will use newly developed seafloor landers equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and the microbial community for the presence of methane-consuming methanotrophs and their activity using advanced genomics techniques that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations. Successful collection of in situ methane consumption rate data and associated microbial community changes should prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and bottom waters impacted by accidental hydrocarbon releases.<br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project will gain critical skills in laboratory and field settings and will also benefit from frequent interactions with established researchers from diverse fields. Team members will participate in hands-on undergraduate education and training through developing individualized research projects leading to honors theses, presentations at national meetings and excellent graduate school placements. Graduate and undergraduates will also participate in K-12 science outreach efforts that help to attract and inform the next generation of oceanographers. The team will work with the University of North Carolina Morehead Planetarium and Science Center and participate directly in the North Carolina Science Festival. Through media contacts made from TED talks, exciting results will be broadly disseminated to the public. The project will have immediate relevance for understanding microbially mediated responses to hydrocarbon inputs from accidental releases along the Southeast Atlantic margin where oil and gas exploration are a constant topic of state and national policy discussions. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Hundreds of recently discovered gas seeps along the continental margin offshore of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina plus thousands in the northern Gulf of Mexico, inject huge amounts of dissolved methane into overlying shelf and slope waters through dissolution of rising bubble plumes. The fate of the methane is largely controlled by a balance between microbial oxidation and advective transport away from seep sources. The efficacy of microbial oxidation likely depends on concentrations of methane, oxygen and ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), as well as in situ pressures and temperatures. Recent shipboard aerobic methane oxidation rate (AMOR) measurements suggest that microbial consumption of seep methane may lag for a week and thus physical dispersion could dominate deepwater methane dynamics through dilution. However, methane stable carbon isotopic measurements in bottom waters suggest that there is no lag before aggressive oxidation of injected methane begins. We propose to conduct in situ measurements of AMOR while simultaneously investigating its microbial drivers at representative North Carolina and Gulf of Mexico continental margin sites featuring numerous active bubble seeps. These sites offer varying concentrations of methane and DIN; performing the experiments in situ will remove much of the uncertainty of shipboard rates. We will conduct the measurements utilizing newly developed benthic lander systems equipped with advanced laser methane sensors that are capable of multi-week AMOR measurements while assaying dissolved oxygen, DIN and the microbial community for the presence of methanotrophs (through metagenomes) and their activity (through metatranscriptomes) that can reveal the nature of methanotrophic responses to ambient methane concentrations.<br/><br/>The project will test key hypotheses about deep-sea methane dynamics including determining if there are significant lags in microbial responses after exposure to elevated methane concentrations, determining the relationships of AMOR to methane and DIN concentrations and investigating the response times and magnitude of methanotrophs to spatial and temporal variability in methane concentration. Successful collection of in situ AMOR and associated microbial community data will prove important for modeling ocean methane dynamics over a range of oceanographic conditions including seep-enriched bottom waters and accidental hydrocarbon releases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mirror symmetry originated in physics as a duality between superconformal quantum field theories. This duality has been interpreted in a consistent, powerful mathematical framework called Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) that has led to dramatic developments in how the mathematical community approaches ideas from theoretical physics, and indeed our conception of space itself. <br/><br/>Today HMS is established as one of the most powerful frameworks for building bridges between seemingly unrelated parts of modern geometry.  Traditionally HMS has been incredibly successful in discovering novel phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic and contact topology informed by algebraic geometry. The goal of this conference is to highlight the flow of ideas in the opposite direction: from symplectic to complex geometry. The conference will summarize recently developed connections between Hodge Theory and HMS which have striking algebraic applications and give new insights into rationality problems. In particular, the conference will focus on new cutting-edge directions of investigation: (1) birational invariants and gluing of D-modules; (2) extending the scope of Homological Mirror Symmetry; (3) categorical Kaehler geometry; and (4) topological recursion.

Much of what we know about past climate comes from analysis of minerals that carry a record of environmental conditions under which they grew. For example, polar ice constitutes an archive of climate extending back hundreds of thousands of years, while the carbonate skeletons of marine organisms carry similar information extending to hundreds of millions of years ago. At present, little is known about environmental conditions on the continents in deep time, primarily because few materials are known that carry a record of paleoclimate and for which an accurate formation age can be determined. Recent work indicates that the mineral goethite, a common iron oxide produced during weathering of continental rocks, can be radiometrically dated and also contains a record of its formation temperature. This award will explore this new method of characterizing continental paleoclimate by developing an efficient and automated technique to assess goethite formation temperature, and, once established, will use that technique to refine the temperature calibration of the method and apply it to suites of dated goethite specimens spanning the last 66 million years from localities in Europe, Brazil, and Australia. The end product will be an improved analytical methodology and amongst the first multimillion year paleotemperature records from the continents. The work will support a graduate student and will also engage students from a local community college in both the science of the undertaking and in the development and programming of the automated analytical system to be developed.<br/><br/>Goethite (FeOOH) is formed when Fe-bearing minerals interact with oxygen-bearing ground and surface waters. In weathering environments, this very insoluble phase forms, survives and accumulates, becoming a major constituent of ferricretes, gossans, paleosols and laterites. Two recent advances suggest that goethite can provide a unique record of paleotemperatures in settings, such as continental interiors, where almost no alternative paleothermometer exists. First, using the (U-Th)/He method goethite can be dated with an uncertainty <5%. A compilation of more than 1500 dates reveals that goethite formation spans, almost without interruption, the entire Cenozoic Era (0-66 Ma). Second, the two crystallographically-distinct oxygen sites have a readily-measured temperature-dependent contrast in 18O/16O, allowing single-phase paleothermometry. This project will link these two advances by undertaking three tasks designed to improve and refine the goethite-internal thermometry method, and to apply it in a systematic way for the first time. Task 1 is to design and build a new oxygen extraction line that can process goethite specimens in a completely automated and efficient way. This is a critical step to permit the large number of oxygen isotopic analyses required by this project. Task 2 is to refine the calibration of the goethite internal thermometer by analyzing synthetic goethites grown under a more diverse range of temperature and chemical conditions than previous work. This task will improve the uncertainty on goethite-internal temperatures, and will identify any as-yet unrecognized secondary controls on derived temperatures. Task 3 consists of the first systematic investigation of the goethite internal thermometry archive. Three suites of already-dated goethites will be analyzed for paleotemperature (total ~100 samples): supergene goethites from a deeply weathered sulfide deposit in the Amazon basin, goethite pisoliths from Central Europe, and goethites from the enigmatic Channel Iron Deposits of Western Australia. From each of these localities we will obtain oxygen isotope data that continuously spans many millions of years. These records will allow the researchers to assess internal consistency of the goethite temperature estimates, and to document for the first time paleotemperatures at high temporal resolution over the entire Cenozoic from three different continents. A fourth task is designed to engage members of the community with this project and simultaneously to teach them a useful skill. The principal investigator will lead a 3-day short-course in Labview, a programming language that fundamentally enables the proposed work. Competitively-selected students participating in the course will include individuals from local high schools and/or community colleges. The short-course will introduce the science and the approaches of goethite-internal thermometry, and coding examples and exercises will be drawn from the proposed analytical work. At the end of the short course one of these students will be selected for a ten-week internship to develop/document Labview code for the proposed extraction line. More traditional Broader Impacts of this project include support for a PhD student, refinement and verification of an entirely new paleoclimate tool that can be broadly applied, and creation of new paleoclimate records from previously unstudied areas that will be useful in geoscience and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such data often suffer from issues such as miscalibration, subjectivity, strategic behavior, and biases. These issues are further amplified in applications (such as those listed above) in which the data comprises evaluations of a set of items by people, where every person evaluates only a subset of items and every item is evaluated by only a subset of people.

For example, data from people often have biases pertaining to certain demographics; subjective opinions or strictness/leniency of the human evaluators can lead to unfairness; some participants may indulge in strategic behavior which can be detrimental to the overall system. This project will design algorithms for eliciting data from people and processing it in a manner that mitigates these issues to the maximum possible extent. The project will have a particular focus on the application of peer review of scholarly research. It will make a significant real-world impact through the research outcomes for applications that depend on data from people, outreach to drive positive policy changes, and synergistic educational activities.<br/><br/>This project will address the issues of miscalibration, subjectivity, strategic behavior and biases in learning from people along three fronts. First, using tools from information theory and statistics, it will establish the fundamental limits on the extent to which these problems can be mitigated. Second, it will develop algorithms that will provably achieve (or approach) these limits, and are also computationally efficient. The research on this front will employ tools from machine learning and statistics, game theory and social choice theory.

Technical Abstract.<br/><br/>The emerging, interdisciplinary field of Bioinspired Materials focuses on developing a fundamental understanding of the synthesis, directed self-assembly and hierarchical organization of natural occurring materials, and uses this understanding to design new synthetic materials whose structure, properties and function and response mimic those of natural materials or living matter. The fundamental concepts behind bioinspired design are becoming increasingly integrated into a wide range of materials and devices intended for the industrial, biological, medical, military and energy sectors, and represent a core focus of research activity of several programs at NSF. Planned sessions include Protocell Engineering (both a Keynote and an Early Career Investigator session), Novel Membrane Design, Active Matter and Motility, Membraneless Organelles, Functional Bioinspired Assemblies, Peptide & Protein Assembly, Tissues & Organoids, and Immune Engineering. These are important current concepts in biomaterials that are at the forefront of our discipline. The meeting will focus on the fundamental challenges of the design of bioinspired materials.<br/><br/>This proposal is to support the registration of 37 participants in the Gordon Research Conference on Bioinspired Materials. The format and structure of the GRC is designed for immersion of scientists into new and emerging concepts in Biomaterials Science ? with an emphasis on breaking results and unpublished data - through long question and answer periods, interactive discussion, significant poster sessions and social activities between sessions. This particular meeting will also have a Gordon Research Seminar, two days before the main meeting, for solely graduate students and post-doctoral associates to present their work, and a Power Hour on ?Strategies for leveling the playing field for the advancement of women in science,? dedicated to a discussion on the main challenges for women in science.

Accurate seafloor depths and nearshore charts are important for forecasting weather, tsunami, and storm surge events that can impact local communities, infrastructure, and shipping industries. The necessity of safe navigation for civilian ships not rated for ice operations and dynamic geographical needs is driving the need for innovative modeling.

Perhaps the most striking theme of modern complexity theory is the fact that basic notions gain new meanings when computational constraints are taken into consideration.   Prominent examples of such notions include proofs, secrecy, knowledge, strategy, communication, interaction, learning---and more recently, even privacy and fairness.  Each of these notions predates computer science by millennia, and at first blush, are not intrinsically related to computation.  And yet, they have all gained entirely new dimensions, and even spawned entirely new fields, when viewed through the lens of complexity theory.  This proposal is centered around another such notion, randomness.  Randomized algorithms pervade both the theory and practice of computer science; beyond computer science, randomness is an especially enigmatic phenomenon that has long fascinated and frustrated philosophers, physicists, and mathematicians alike.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is on the complexity-theoretic study of randomness, with a focus on unconditional derandomization, i.e., using concrete constructions to eliminate the need for randomness in certain algorithms. (Famous conjectures, such as P=BPP, posit that randomization can be dispensed with entirely. However, all but a few significant results in this direction make use of unproved assumptions.) This is essentially a fine-grained study of randomness in computing, focusing on simple and natural function classes such as small-width branching programs, various restricted types of circuits and formulas, half-spaces and their generalizations.   While these function classes do not capture all polynomial-time computation, results in this area are among the few that can be proved without unproved hypotheses.  Furthermore, each of these classes illuminates an important aspect of efficient computation: small-depth circuits capture highly parallelizable computation, small-width branching programs capture memory-efficient computation, half-spaces capture linearly-separable data, and so on.   The investigator will develop new structural results for three touchstone function classes in complexity theory---polynomial threshold functions, polytopes, and Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form---and leverage these results in the design of optimal pseudorandom generators for them.<br/><br/>Research on this project will be fully integrated with a detailed education plan that will involve and help develop graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition to advising Ph.D. students, the investigator will continue advise undergraduates through CURIS, Stanford's popular summer undergraduate research internship program; he will develop a comprehensive, year-long course sequence in complexity theory; he will organize an annual young complexity theorists workshop, to be hosted at Stanford; and finally, he plans to publish his lecture notes as a book.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Special next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflows have become one of the most important tools for personalized medicine, helping scientists discover new ways to diagnose cancer and other diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes.  While sequencing platforms continue to advance technologically, less attention has been given to improving the necessary and difficult step of fragmenting or shearing genomic DNA (gDNA) to prepare samples for NGS.  An estimated 75-80% of work activity in a modern-day analytical lab is spent on processing and preparing samples. The current industry standard for  gDNA shearing requires expensive instrumentation (>$150,000), and can require more than 2 hours to serially process 96-samples. Less expensive alternative solutions perform inconsistently, and are not amenable for high-throughput applications.  A critical need exists for a high-throughput, low-cost solution for parts of this process. The proposed project is focused on developing a targeted lens technology for a high-throughput, low-cost sonication device. The ultimate goal of this project is to make sample processing for NGS applications inexpensive, consistent, fast, and widely available.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a transformative solution to inconsistent, costly, and cumbersome sample processing for NGS.   The Targeted Multifocal Lens (TML) technology will enable consistent, parallel gDNA shearing of 96 samples in a standard PCR microplate, improving by an order of magnitude both throughput speed and reduced capital costs.  The TML technology employs kinoform theory to enable focused sonication of multiple samples using just a single acoustic source, thus eliminating the need for robotic scanning systems. In Phase I, we will design and prototype a novel bath-type sonicator that integrates with the TML technology. We will perform theoretical and experimental modeling and characterization to demonstrate feasibility of TML for consistent sonication of a 96-well microplate. We will finally validate the performance of the prototype sonicator by shearing 96 samples of gDNA in parallel, in under 15 minutes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This band, known as the inter-tropical convergence zone, or ITCZ, is generally found north of the equator with a mean latitude of about 6N.  Many aspects of the ITCZ including its existence, its role in global atmospheric circulation, and its preference for the Northern Hemisphere can be understood by thinking of the ITCZ as a uniform strip of convection with the same width, central latitude, and rainfall intensity at all longitudes.  But this longitudinally averaged view of the ITCZ overlooks substantial variations in ITCZ latitude around the tropics.  In particular the ITCZ is found south of the equator in the Indian Ocean and it has a southwest to northeast slope across both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  The latitude of the ITCZ can thus be anywhere from from 4S to 10N depending on the ocean basin, the longitude within that basin, and the time of year.<br/><br/>This project uses combination of observational analysis and carefully designed model simulations to study regional variations in ITCZ latitude and other properties.  For instance the northward displacement of the ITCZ in the eastern Pacific has been attributed to the geography of the North and South American coastlines, an idea which can be tested through simulations in which the west coasts of the Americas are mirror images of each other.  The importance of oceanic processes is tested using simplified ocean configurations which allow some mechanisms but disable others.  Ocean model configurations include a simple motionless ""slab"" ocean, a modified slab ocean which captures near-surface heat transport driven by surface winds, and a ""shallow water"" ocean model which allows surface cooling due to the upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean.  In addition, the project develops a version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in which flux corrections are applied to improve the representation of the ITCZ.<br/><br/>The work is of practical interest given the importance of the ITCZ for tropical rainfall as well as its outsized effects on the climate and atmospheric circulation of the earth.  Despite its importance the ITCZ is not well simulated in models used for weather prediction and climate change projections, thus a better understanding of ITCZ dynamics could be quite useful for model improvement.  The work also has value for the broader research enterprise, as model configurations developed for the project will be openly available for adoption by the worldwide research community.

The project expands upon the investigators' previous analysis of quadrupedalism among platyrrhines and includes a three-dimensional kinematic analysis of arboreal leaping. The investigators will document locomotor kinematics of primates moving in their natural habitats using multi-camera, high-speed, high-resolution videography, sampling arboreal locomotion on a range of substrates and quantifying standard kinematic spatiotemporal variables. The morphology of the arboreal locomotor substrates will be quantified using novel remote sensing methods, with specific measurements including substrate diameter, orientation, height above the ground, and compliance. By expanding the sampled range of locomotor behaviors, body sizes, substrates, and taxa, this project will facilitate a more comprehensive investigation of how substrate variation and phylogenetic history have influenced primate locomotor adaptation and evolution.

This is because juveniles are typically more susceptible to infectious disease than adults. Indeed, the spread of many human diseases such as measles and chicken pox is largely driven by children. Likewise in many wildlife species, the spring ?pulse? of new highly susceptible young can drive epidemics, including diseases that risk spilling over into human or livestock populations. However, we lack a basic understanding of why juveniles are inherently so susceptible, even after accounting for prior exposure to disease. This research will use mathematical models and experiments with a model plant system to investigate the fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes driving the evolution of age-specific susceptibility. The results will substantially increase our understanding of the feedbacks between resistance evolution and disease spread, which will improve management strategies for wildlife disease, and inform crop breeding for disease resistance. The research will also increase public understanding of science and enrich local biodiversity records and museum collections through new citizen science outreach activities that are integrated with the basic research.  <br/><br/>The question of why juveniles are so susceptible to disease is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective because infection prior to reproduction would seem to have a much greater negative impact on a host than infection later in life (after the host has had a chance to reproduce). Natural selection should therefore favor individuals that are less susceptible to disease when they are young. This project will test the novel hypothesis that juvenile susceptibility is maintained by feedbacks between evolutionary change in host resistance and ecological change in disease abundance. These ?eco-evolutionary? feedbacks occur because the evolution of disease resistance at any age in the host population, can in turn reduce the intensity of disease epidemics. Critically, lower disease-levels make it less likely that a host will encounter disease as a juvenile, thereby allowing the maintenance of juvenile susceptibility. The researchers will build on this novel eco-evolutionary framework to develop a predictive mathematical theory for understanding key host and pathogen traits, and the feedbacks driving the evolution of age-specific disease susceptibility. Then to establish how these age-specific selection pressures are instantiated in a real-world system and to test key predictions from the model, the research team will utilize the model plant-disease system, anther-smut (Microbotryum) on white campion (Silene latifolia) to quantify the fitness costs, benefits, and evolutionary potential of age-specific resistance under a range of disease frequencies. To increase the broader impacts and societal benefits of the proposed work the researchers will engage local natural history societies in original scientific research on the distribution and diversity of ?micro-fungi?, and provide meaningful research opportunities for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the advantages of UMW over conventional fusion welding techniques are the ability to join dissimilar metals, energy efficiency, short welding cycles, and environmental friendliness, making it a promising joining technology for the advanced manufacturing of electrified and lightweight vehicles. Nevertheless, UMW has a relatively narrow operating window and is very sensitive to unpredictable, uncontrollable environmental conditions. This longstanding knowledge gap in the underlying process mechanisms makes the prediction and control of joint quality difficult, which limits its use. This project will take advantage of the emergent information-centric transformation of manufacturing science by leveraging advances in process physics, microstructural analysis, and data science. By establishing dynamic, stochastic relationships between process conditions, microstructural weld attributes, online sensing data, and weld performance, the research will advance the fundamental understanding of process mechanisms in UMW. The knowledge gained will be used to establish a suite of machine learning-based decision-making tools that will ultimately enable smart UMW. This grant will also support diverse educational and outreach activities that contribute to the education of the U.S. smart manufacturing workforce. <br/><br/>It is a widely accepted hypothesis that UMW process conditions influence the joining performance via the dynamic evolution of micro-scale weld attributes and the weld formation process generates a signature, as reflected in parameters that can be sensed online. Nonetheless, there exist no studies to date that adequately model or quantify the inherent dynamic, stochastic process-attribute-data-performance (PADP) relationship. The overarching goal of this research is to create a PADP modeling framework that consists of innovative machine learning and statistical models. The framework will be completed in two steps. First, spatiotemporal models incorporating uncertainty quantification will be built to characterize the process-attribute-performance relationship. Second, a tensor-based correlation and regression analysis will be performed to investigate the attribute-data relationship. This framework will be further employed to develop a series of physics-aware, machine learning tools for process control, including process optimization, online quality monitoring, and real-time control. Finally, the project will investigate the use of a transfer learning methodology to provide a cost-effective way to build PADP models and decision-making strategies for related products or product families. This learning capability will be an essential component in the cloud intelligence that enables the smart manufacturing paradigm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Air pollution increases the risk of cancer, stroke, heart disease, respiratory infections; further, it may play a role in Alzheimer's disease and diabetes, resulting in trillions of dollars of health care costs globally each year. Half of these costs may be attributed to roadway traffic sourced pollution. Traffic sourced pollution is possibly intercepted by trees, although improperly configured roadside trees do not produce these benefits and creating the opportunity for improved health via targeted engineering of roadside tree placements. This project will develop analysis and design tools to make sure that such tree plantings optimize benefits for ecosystem designers, health insurance companies, governments, and local businesses.<br/><br/>This SBIR project will develop a system to optimize high-resolution site-specific tree placement for pollution reduction.  Trees are known to reduce air pollution by acting like filters as their high surface area attracts pollutants. Tightly packed trees of a type with high surface area placed on the leeward side of a busy roadway can intercept > 30% of traffic sourced pollutants.  This project will perform ground-based, high-resolution vegetation analysis on neighborhoods under study. These data will be used to train an algorithm to infer high-resolution vegetation properties from widely available, low-cost data streams. These inferred vegetation metrics will be integrated with a geospatial ecosystem design automation pipeline to create a software tool.

These chemical compounds are often unique to certain plant parts in different plant groups. This project seeks to understand the evolution of plant-derived chemical compounds and how these compounds promote plant diversity. To address these questions, the project will focus on the plants within the Caryophyllales, a group that includes cacti and many alpine and arctic plants known for extraordinary adaptations to warm, dry, or cold environments. Many Caryophyllales species produce unusually large amounts of diverse compounds derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Due to inherent biochemical trade-offs, the production of these tyrosine-derived compounds may come at the expense of other compounds derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. We will study the balance of the production of these two amino acids and its effect on the production of myriad compounds important in UV shielding, pollination, and herbivore deterrence. The work will inform the biotechnological production of natural plant pigments and will help to elucidate biosynthetic pathways of a number of high-value plant-derived chemicals with pharmaceutical value. The collaborative US-UK team will provide multidisciplinary training opportunities for students and post-doctoral scholars in genetic and biochemical methods in an evolutionary context. Workshops at professional society meetings, a K-12 summer camp module, and multiple public outreach modules will bring these concepts to the public and highlight the relationship between biodiversity and high-value plant chemical compounds. <br/><br/>This study will perform an extensive survey to establish the occurrence and distribution of key tyrosine- and phenylalanine-derived metabolites in 600 species across Caryophyllales; examine the association of these tyrosine-derived metabolic traits with organismal adaptation and diversification patterns; and determine the evolutionary genetic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites. New tools will be developed to model the hierarchical nature of metabolite evolution and will be made available to the broader community of scientists. This project will comprehensively describe the extent of tyrosine-enriched metabolism in Caryophyllales, define the degree to which these metabolites are associated with organismal diversification patterns across Caryophyllales, and resolve the evolutionary assembly of the genetic pathways underlying complex tyrosine-derived metabolic traits.

This project will conduct a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify resource use and environmental and human health impacts of vegetable production with two water-based farming techniques in five commercialized facilities (three for hydroponics and two for aquaponics) built in densely populated areas in New Jersey. The research team will undertake both on-site data collection and software modeling in conducting LCA. The scope for analysis will cover all the impacts in facility establishment, vegetable production, and upstream supply chains. The project is expected to improve understanding of hydroponics and aquaponics, and provide recommendations to improve technologies and guidance to select among various farming techniques. The study has the potential to lead to greater application of water-based farming in urban areas and add another source of food supply to city dwellers that have limited access to fresh and nutritious foods. Increased applications could help reduce hunger and increase food diversity, independence, and resiliency of cities. In addition, the project will extend research on sustainable farming and provide a learning practicum for students.<br/><br/>The project targets to: 1) Establish an inventory of resources used, vegetables produced, and emissions from the facilities; 2) Analyze environmental and human health impacts of various vegetables produced and identify key factors that cause resource use and impacts; and, 3) Compare the LCA results and figure out how resource use and impacts are related to facility design, scale, and type of vegetable growing. Finally, the study will discuss how to improve hydroponic design and operation to reduce resource consumption and impacts, and create a general guide for cities, communities, and families to select water-based farming techniques according to varied locations, land and resource availability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Human activities in watersheds are causing many lakes and reservoirs to become over-enriched in nutrients. This is called hypereutrophication. Over-enrichment can cause a variety of problems in ecosystems, including changes in carbon cycling. While substantial progress has been made in understanding the processes that control carbon cycling in lakes and reservoirs, relatively little is known about how those processes operate in water bodies with extremely high nutrient concentrations, a condition which is becoming increasingly common. This research is aimed at identifying the key controls on carbon cycling in lakes and reservoirs under extreme nutrient loading. This will help predict how these ecosystems will respond to future environmental stresses. In addition to carbon cycling, lakes and reservoirs also provide important ecosystem services that are threatened by eutrophication. Managing freshwater resources to protect ecosystem services is vital for societal well-being. Yet, decisions about freshwater resources require educated water stewards working at the local level. This project will provide extensive training in aquatic ecosystem management to local water stewards, empowering their communities to make informed, data-driven decisions about lake and watershed management. <br/><br/>In order to identify when and where the important drivers of carbon cycling are operating in lakes under extreme nutrient enrichment, high frequency sensors will be deployed in high-nutrient lakes to capture carbon cycling dynamics throughout the entire year. One of the focal study lakes is located on the Iowa State University campus. The live-streaming data and monitoring activities will be incorporated into educational opportunities across campus. An additional 20 lake-years of high frequency data will be collected through a lake management education and volunteer training program for local water stewards. All of the sensor-based measurements will be paired with less frequent synoptic sampling to quantify the pools of carbon and nutrients entering and cycling in the lakes. These time series will be used to quantify the aerobic, anaerobic, and physical transport processes controlling carbon cycling dynamics and to determine the environmental drivers of carbon cycling rates. This information, combined with long term water quality monitoring data from 130 lakes embedded in a nutrient-rich landscape, will be used to estimate aquatic carbon cycling rates at a regional scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This device and the data it collects will be used to improve the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes, that cumulatively cost the US economy over $200 billion per year.

Recent advances in developmental biology and genomics techniques now provide alternative methods to reconstruct the evolutionary steps that gave rise to animal body plans. Studies of water bear  (Tardigrade) development may be especially informative for investigating two important themes of body plan evolution?segmentation and miniaturization. Segmentation is a common characteristic of animals.  This project will investigate tardigrade development in order to reconstruct the evolutionary steps that underlie the origins of the segmentation mechanisms that are present in modern animals. Miniaturization has evolved independently in several animal lineages, including in the tardigrade lineage, but very little is known about the developmental underpinnings of miniaturization. This project aims to identify the developmental origins of the compact tardigrade body plan, and to determine the consequences of miniaturization on the developmental mechanisms that control development of the tardigrade gut. Results of this work may reveal general developmental principles that underlie miniaturization. This project will provide training to eleven undergraduate students. A key aim is to provide training to students from underrepresented groups in biology. Research on tardigrades also provides an excellent opportunity to foster public science outreach. This project uses research activities to enhance public science literacy in Jacksonville, FL. <br/><br/>A recent study of Hox genes revealed that the tardigrade body plan evolved by the loss of mid-trunk segments. This result raises several questions. (1) What is the developmental basis for the loss of mid-trunk segments? In many bilaterians, before growth of a mid-trunk region, antagonistic interactions between the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and inhibitors of this pathway specify anterior and posterior regions of the body axis. This work will test whether this mechanism specifies the entire body axis of a tardigrade, as predicted if tardigrades simply lost the ability to grow a mid-trunk region. (2) Do the remaining segments in tardigrades develop by the same segmentation mechanisms that have been identified in arthropods? To address this question, experiments will test whether the segment polarity gene network that specifies segment boundaries in arthropods also specifies segment boundaries in tardigrades. Results of this study will illuminate where in panarthropod phylogeny this network evolved a role in specifying segment boundaries. (3) What was the impact of the loss of mid-trunk segments on the gut, an unsegmented part of the body axis? To address this question, this work will determine the extent to which mechanisms that pattern the gut during development in other bilaterians have diverged in tardigrades. Experiments will utilize RNA interference to disrupt gene function and situ hybridization to characterize gene expression patterns during development of the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris. This research will provide insight into developmental underpinnings of the evolution of segmentation and secondary simplification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this regime, multiple agents (e.g., processors or sensors) communicate their information locally with their neighbors to cooperatively optimize a global performance metric. This decentralized paradigm plays a key role in the network domains where communication with a centralized coordinator is either undesirable or impossible. This also allows for preserving the privacy of the agents. It is for these reasons that the design and performance analysis of decentralized optimization methods have attracted a growing attention in several application domains such as data science, wireless networks, and communication networks. This project is aimed at development of new models, mathematical tools, and computational algorithms to address emerging complex multi-agent systems. This complexity arises in emerging applications such as remote sensing, economic dispatch models with renewable energy, and efficiency estimation in transportation networks. This proposal has the potential to substantially reduce the gap between the theory and real-world practice of complex multi-agent networks. Moreover, collaborations with the industrial partner will facilitate effective knowledge transfer. This project is also aimed at increasing awareness and interest among high school students, educators, and college students through several fully integrated educational and outreach activities. These include enhancing professional development of teachers of Stillwater High School, engaging secondary students in after school activities, and promoting diversity through involvement of underrepresented undergraduate students in research. <br/><br/>The long-term research goal is to advance the computational models and algorithms for distributed constrained optimization in emerging complex multi-agent networks. In pursuit of this goal, the research objective of this CAREER proposal is to apply the theory of variational inequalities and regularization in the field of distributed optimization to design new algorithms with provable performance guarantees that can address multi-agent networks with complex constraints. This complexity arises in several application domains such as wireless sensor networks, transportation networks, and machine learning, where the optimization model is complicated due to the presence of:  (1) uncertainty and nonlinearity in constraints; (2) an inner-level large-scale optimization problem; or (3) equilibrium constraints. The state-of-the-art approaches including weighted-averaging consensus, push-sum, and alternate direction multiplier methods work often under the premise that functional constraints are easy-to-project. These schemes rely significantly on Lagrangian duality theory and do not lend themselves to asynchronous protocols and communication delays. Accordingly, this research is expected to advance the area of distributed optimization over complex networks by: (i) Development of an enhanced mathematical modeling framework by utilizing the theory of variational inequalities; (ii) Design and analysis of new classes of iteratively regularized consensus-based algorithms with explicit performance bounds to address the proposed modeling framework; and (iii) Explore novel ways to address nonsmoothness in the proposed modeling framework. The long-term educational goal is to broaden the participation of K-12 and college students (in particular women and underrepresented minorities in STEM) in the fields of Operations Research and Applied Mathematics. In pursuit of this goal, the educational objective of this CAREER proposal is to inspire and engage young minds, formal and informal educators, and undergraduate and graduate students in understanding the role of optimization in tomorrow?s practice. This includes the following activities: (i) provide four-week professional development workshops for secondary teachers; (ii) develop an after school STEM program for Stillwater High School students; (iii) involve underrepresented undergraduate students in the PI?s research in collaboration with The Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation; and (iv) develop an undergraduate and an advanced doctoral course.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ongoing advances in using light for communication through the concept of visible light communication (VLC) make optical wireless relevant to advancing the state--of--the-- art in underwater wireless communication systems. The optical spectrum presents a favorable mode for communicating underwater due to the low signal absorption levels, particularly in the ultraviolet, violet, blue and green wavelengths. Prior work in underwater VLC has largely been theoretical and this research takes a radical high-risk approach to develop empirical models for underwater VLC across real-world configurations and settings. The research takes a transformative approach and explores photo-acoustic hybrid communication in which acoustic and optical wireless communication modes co-exist and complement each other.  Photo-acoustic underwater communication modalities can help advance plethora of applications including underwater navigation, exploration, sensing and tactical communications. This research advances the field of underwater networking by bridging the knowledge gap in building realistic underwater photo-acoustic systems through extensive experimentation in real-world conditions and creates a rich open public dataset. This research maintains a strategic collaboration with the Gwinnett County Water Innovation Center near Atlanta, Georgia, thus expanding the outreach of this work and advancing underwater research using advanced facilities. In addition to dissemination of research outcomes through publications, the research involves female student groups from the university Girls-Who-Code (GWC) chapter in underwater research data collection and experiments.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this research are derived along two thrusts executed over a 2-year timeline: Thrust 1 - Empirical Modeling of Underwater VLC Channels. This thrust focuses on extensive underwater channel modeling experimentation and data collection in lab and real-world underwater sites. The data points are used to perform empirical modeling of underwater VLC channels along various spatial dimensions (horizontal, vertical, line-of-sight, non line-of-sight), along different physical parameters (salinity, turbidity, temperature and oiliness), and in mobile scenarios. Thrust 2 - Photo-Acoustic Underwater Communication Feasibility Studies. This thrust focuses on the feasibility of integrating the hardware and software of optical wireless (UV and VLC), with acoustic systems. The research conducts experiments across different use-cases for photo-acoustic communication and sensing, particularly for navigation and tracking and device-device communication. In summary, the key outcomes of this research include empirical models for underwater VLC channels, insights from photo-acoustic communication feasibility experimental studies and open datasets for underwater VLC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address these questions, the project will focus on the plants within the Caryophyllales, a group that includes cacti and many alpine and arctic plants known for extraordinary adaptations to warm, dry, or cold environments. Many Caryophyllales species produce unusually large amounts of diverse compounds derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Due to inherent biochemical trade-offs, the production of these tyrosine-derived compounds may come at the expense of other compounds derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. We will study the balance of the production of these two amino acids and its effect on the production of myriad compounds important in UV shielding, pollination, and herbivore deterrence. The work will inform the biotechnological production of natural plant pigments and will help to elucidate biosynthetic pathways of a number of high-value plant-derived chemicals with pharmaceutical value. The collaborative US-UK team will provide multidisciplinary training opportunities for students and post-doctoral scholars in genetic and biochemical methods in an evolutionary context. Workshops at professional society meetings, a K-12 summer camp module, and multiple public outreach modules will bring these concepts to the public and highlight the relationship between biodiversity and high-value plant chemical compounds. <br/><br/>This study will perform an extensive survey to establish the occurrence and distribution of key tyrosine- and phenylalanine-derived metabolites in 600 species across Caryophyllales; examine the association of these tyrosine-derived metabolic traits with organismal adaptation and diversification patterns; and determine the evolutionary genetic mechanisms responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites. New tools will be developed to model the hierarchical nature of metabolite evolution and will be made available to the broader community of scientists. This project will comprehensively describe the extent of tyrosine-enriched metabolism in Caryophyllales, define the degree to which these metabolites are associated with organismal diversification patterns across Caryophyllales, and resolve the evolutionary assembly of the genetic pathways underlying complex tyrosine-derived metabolic traits.

The current standard of care is a highly invasive cranial flap resection, which not only risks infection, uncontrolled bleeding, and damage to healthy tissue, but also has prolonged post-operative recovery. Although minimally invasive laser ablation tools have been developed, they require the probe to be inserted directly into the target, which still risks bleeding and damaging tissue. Furthermore, while minimally invasive HIFU tools are available for other conditions, new technologies are needed to address more distant focal points and account for tissue-specific effects in the brain. This device is designed to: 1) reduce risks of infection, bleeding, and incidental damage to tissue; 2) reduce operating (and hence anesthesia) time; and 3) improve quality of life for patients by promoting faster recovery and improved aesthetics. The target addressable market is estimated to be nearly $1 B, with an additional $283 M per year for disposable kits and maintenance/upgrades. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project is developing a novel high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device offering a minimally invasive alternative to cranial flap resections to remove brain tumors. The key differentiating advantage of this technology is in the combination of: 1) a probe that is inserted through a minimally invasive burr hole in the skull, allowing a much smaller incision size compared to a cranial flap surgery; and 2) the use of HIFU, which can be focused at a distance from the tip of the transducer (without inserting the tip directly into the target). The main technical hurdles to be addressed are to 1) design a miniaturized therapeutic ultrasound transducer to allow safe insertion into the brain while maintaining similar acoustic properties to a larger transducer; and 2) include capabilities to steer the focus of HIFU to ablate larger targets of complex geometry. To achieve these goals, the project will:   1) create a digital model to miniaturize an existing prototype that maintains acoustic performance and integrates HIFU steering capabilities; 2) fabricate a physical prototype matching the predicted acoustic power capabilities; and 3) show proof-of-concept functionality of the prototype in a phantom material and human cadaver brain. If successful, the final deliverable will be a prototype ready for preclinical validation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical part of this endeavor involves advancing our understanding of the relative contributions of learning that is explicit (i.e., involves conscious awareness) vs. implicit (i.e., does not involve conscious awareness). To investigate the relative contributions of and relationship between explicit and implicit L2 processing, this project combines an artificial language learning experiment with recently-developed machine learning analysis techniques for electroencephalography (EEG), a neurolinguistic method that can detect brain activity related to language processing in a non-invasive way. This will inform theoretical debates between models of language learning that posit that implicit/explicit processing are separated by a strong interface, a weak interface, or no interface. Such an improved understanding of implicit/explicit grammar processing might inform second language pedagogy by suggesting how implicit methods (e.g., naturalistic exposure) and explicit methods (e.g., grammar-oriented drills) should be balanced to maximize learning.<br/><br/>Experiment participants will perform a language learning task involving four new words with a hidden grammatical rule (two words usually co-occur with living things and two with non-living things). Afterwards, participants will answer debriefing questions to determine if/when they became aware of the rule. Prior research indicates that even rule-unaware participants show signs of learning, in that rule-violating trials feature distinct neural activity and slower responses when compared to rule-following trials. This project extends such research with machine learning-based analysis techniques which can assess the degree to which different neurocognitive events are similar in the timing and location of brain activity. The first analysis tests whether neural markers of implicit (rule-unaware) grammar processing occur during periods of explicit (rule-aware) processing. The second analysis tests whether implicit and explicit processing differ in the occurrence of linguistic prediction (defined here as the occurrence of neural patterns related to the processing of living words as opposed to non-living words, when participants read the living/non-living-encoding artificial language word in isolation). The third analysis tests whether language task reaction times show a consistent relationship with the timing of neural markers of implicit and explicit processing, to determine whether participants? external responses are driven by conscious vs. unconscious processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will be used in conventional and organic farming, as well as personal protection/mosquito repellent products, costing significantly less than the products currently on the market. Crop losses due to insect pests cost billions of dollars and the limited classes of insecticides are vulnerable to the constant threat of resistance.  In addition, the lack of specificity creates broad risks due to pesticide residues polluting food and water and causing environmental damage. In particular, organic farming needs effective bioinsecticides for economically sustainable yields.

These so-called emulsions are commonly found in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals where mixtures of oil-loving and water-loving molecules must work together to function properly. Surface-active molecules and particles - termed surfactants - adsorb at oil-water interfaces to stabilize emulsions and prevent unmixing. This project aims to create magnet surfactants that use external magnetic fields to power dynamic functions such as mixing and propulsion at the level of individual emulsion droplets. The project will investigate the magnetically driven motions of particles adsorbed at curved interfaces and their use in pumping fluids at the micron-scale. The resulting active emulsions are potentially important for accelerating and/or controlling the rates of drug delivery or chemical reactions within complex fluids. In addition to research training for graduate and undergraduate students, the project will provide educational outreach to middle and high school students from diverse backgrounds. In collaboration with the Inside Engineering initiative, the researchers will develop and implement a laboratory visit curriculum for students from nearby schools in Manhattan and the Bronx. Through hands-on demonstrations and active learning strategies, the program aims to get students excited about the processes of scientific inquiry and engineering design.<br/><br/>Rapid particle motions in uniform fields are made possible by coupling magnetic torques to capillary forces at curved interfaces. Building on recent demonstrations of these magneto-capillary dynamics, the project will investigate how time-varying magnetic fields can drive complex particle motions and interfacial flows within and around liquid droplets. The project aims (1) to understand how the waveform of the driving field and the properties of the magnetic particles direct their dynamic motions on curved interfaces; (2) to quantify the transient fluid flows within and around emulsion droplets induced by particle motions; and (3) to identify specific particle types and driving protocols optimized for desired functions such as enhancing mass transfer and propelling droplet motions. These aims will be achieved through a combination of experiments on particle/emulsion systems and modeling of magneto-capillary particle dynamics and fluid flows. The project will examine how these field induced flows can be harnessed for enhancing mass transfer and for propelling drop motions. In contrast to bulk processing of macroscopic emulsions, distributed actuation within active emulsions will enable new strategies for engineering reaction kinetics, mass transport, and separations within multiphase fluids. In pursuit of these functions, automated tools for Bayesian inference, experimental design, and optimization will be developed and deployed to enable the efficient exploration of possible driving fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pairing of industry experts and practitioners with academic researchers in this area?using the NSF Convergence Accelerator approach--will help contribute to the development of systems and products to help society realize the benefits of networked information technology without sacrificing privacy and individual rights. The results of this project will help shape the agenda of both research and practice to achieve this outcome.<br/><br/>Given the centrality of data to modern organizations and to society, data governance is a key contemporary business and societal problem that needs to be addressed. The need and demand for addressing data privacy issues reaches across every sphere of work, whether in business and industry, government, higher education, non-profits, or civil society organizations. All organizations, regardless of their size, will require solutions that enable them to embed privacy and data protection in their operation and provide access to tools that help safeguard personal data. <br/><br/>As the impact of data-intensive technologies increases and the pace of innovation accelerates, the resultant privacy risks from more extensive collection and processing of personal data also increase. As the data ecosystem and regulatory requirements grow more complex, organizations are urgently seeking ways to comply with the law and ensure all necessary data protections for their customers, clients and constituents. <br/><br/>The technical, organizational, and logistical complexity of modern-day data governance, along with the pressing need to protect and respect individual privacy rights, constitute a ?grand challenge problem?.

Glaucoma is a leading  cause of blindness for people over 60 years old and affects approximately 3 million people in the USA. The incidence of glaucoma is expected to rise to 76 million by 2020 and 112 million people by 2040 worldwide.  Unfortunately, glaucoma is not curable, but it is manageable with proper treatments. Although IOP is a highly dynamic parameter, conventional measurements fail to track it for a 24-hour period.

This type of system could be adapted for other pressure measurements in other parts of the body as well. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of parity-time (PT) symmetry in quantum mechanics into radio-frequency (RF) telemetric sensing systems, enabling new ways to enhance resolution, accuracy, and sensitivity of versatile zero-power wireless pressure sensors (e.g., intraocular, intracranial and other biological pressures). Specifically, the team?s PT telemetry technologies employed an active loss-compensation circuit, which not only can compensate the power dissipation in minimally-invasive microsensors, but also allows a large shift of peak frequency under changes in vital physiological factors (i.e., a higher sensitivity), thanks to the eigenvalue bifurcation effect around the exceptional points found in PT systems. This wireless readout technology will be exploited to continuously record IOP levels from a biocompatible, monolithically microfabricated CLS, with enhanced sensitivity and resolvability. In addition, machine learning and signal processing algorithms will be exploited to address the long-term stability and signal drift issues in the practical IOP monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theme of 17th ICC - 2020 Vision for Catalysis - aims to look into the future for catalysis research guided by the past and to assess the present state of catalysis in context of what lies ahead. The program will highlight recent developments,challenges, and opportunities in the context of shifting feedstocks and in the discovery and development of experimental and computational methods. The scientific program will include plenary and keynote lectures, invited and ontributed papers and poster presentations. The proceedings of all International Congresses are published as abstracts on the web. They also constitute a significant part of the archival literature on catalysis. The critical importance of catalysis is reflected by the fact that 25-30% of all manufactured goods in the United States involve at least one catalytic step. Because advances in a large number of catalytic processes, which are crucial to U.S. interests, will be presented at this meeting, it is important to ensure participation from both the U.S. academic and the industrial sectors. Furthermore, the International Congress is a rare opportunity for U.S. students to interact with fellow students and premier researchers from all across the world at the most prestigious conference the catalysis community has to offer. This will significantly assist with maintaining U.S. research competitiveness, while also inspiring students to tackle grand challenges related to catalytic processes. Catalysis is an enabling technology for a broad range of scientific and engineering impact areas related to environmental pollution control, sustainability, energy, and chemicals, to name just a few.

Heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems consume about two-thirds of the total energy used in commercial buildings. Despite national efforts toward improving performance and sustainability, many existing HVAC systems in buildings do not run efficiently, due to equipment degradation, sensors being out of calibration, or improper control operations. Such problems can result in high maintenance costs, occupant discomfort, and wasted energy. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for HVAC systems in buildings detect and identify operational faults based on the analysis of measured system behaviors. FDD technology is critical to improving building energy efficiency, and reducing or eliminating wasted energy in buildings caused by operational faults. The major challenge in current FDD technology is that the training data available to create diagnostic algorithms do not include all possible operating conditions that the testing systems experience throughout the life cycle. Given that the training data for FDDs does not cover all operating conditions, FDD algorithms for building HVAC systems must evolve along with the changes in building systems and components. The goal of this project is to enhance the robustness and efficiency of FDD technology for high-performance HVAC systems.  The proposed research will lead to several broader impacts including research participation of underrepresented undergraduates, K-12 outreach activities, and sharing the experimental data and the FDD method for high-performance HVAC systems with other researchers. The knowledge gained from this research has the potential to significantly enhance building energy efficiency.<br/>       <br/>The overall research goal is to advance robustness and efficiency of Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) technology through an adaptive machine learning-based approach for high-performance Heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This research closes critical knowledge gaps in the FDDs for high-performance HVAC systems. First, the experimental study on common faults in high-performance HVAC systems at the Center for High Performance Buildings, Purdue University will result in a thorough understanding of fault features, including system behaviors as well as impacts on energy consumption and environmental conditions. While extensive research has been conducted on the FDD for conventional HVAC systems, the FDD for high-performance HVAC systems has rarely been studied. The experimental data pertaining to common faults in high-performance HVAC systems that will be obtained as a part of this project will, thus, be an invaluable asset to the FDD research community. Second, this research will yield an adaptive FDD method based on growing Gaussian mixture regressions for high-performance HVAC systems in commercial buildings. Traditional FDD methods learn from training data tested under limited operating conditions, after which the learning stops. This new FDD method adapts to the changes in HVAC operating environments, evolves with the changes in building systems and components, and learns to diagnose new faulty conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine learning (ML) algorithms trained on an underlying database produce predictive models, which can 1) make instantaneous predictions of properties of a new yet-to-be-synthesized polymer, and 2) make recommendations of new and existing polymers that will meet design objectives. The goal is to create a customized application-specific polymer design tool for end-user companies, and a generic data-to-model product line that ingests in-house proprietary (legacy/historic) polymer data to produce predictive models for polymer manufacturing companies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional wisdom in political science indicates that power-sharing institutions can foster loyalty to the state among certain target groups, such as ethnic minority citizens. However, existing studies have found inconclusive evidence. Additionally, existing research has yet to identify mechanisms linking power-sharing and attachment to the state. This research seeks to address these gaps. Based on an original dataset of household survey and qualitative interviews with local residents and civil servants, it examines power-sharing at the local level of government. Its contribution to the literature lies in a careful tracing and elucidation of the interactions between the target citizens and the state via its agents (the civil servants) and how these interactions shape citizens' view of and attachment to government. This work will inform policymakers that the way in which public service is delivered in a micro-level interaction between citizens and local agents of the state has consequential implications for the way some residents view government institutions.<br/> <br/>This research project seeks to answer to the following questions: (1) what shapes ethnic minority citizens' sense of attachment to the state?, and (2) why has the state been more successful in winning over a sense of attachment from members of some ethnic minority groups than other groups? To answer these questions, it takes a multi-method approach and uses an original dataset, consisting of household survey data and ethnic minority groups' actual level of representation at various levels of government. It proposes to test a set of hypotheses through regression analysis, and builds on existing literature on power-sharing, but takes a novel approach that focuses on power-sharing at the local -- rather than national -- level of government. Empirically, it goes well beyond showing correlation between the dependent and independent variables of interest; it estimates the effect of power-sharing with ethnic minorities at the national, regional, and local levels of government on their attachment to the state and addresses why and how the effects occur.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While today?s Internet was developed to provide widespread connectivity to individuals and businesses across the world, the networks that support the Internet do not have built-in security mechanisms. This project is focused on solving that problem by investigating future network designs based on new network technology that would support security and provide defense across a wide variety of attacks.  The project vision is to develop Programmable In-network Security, or ?Poise?. Poise aims to design and integrate a wide range of defenses directly inside the network, leveraging the technology trend of network programmability. If successful, a Poise network would support security as naturally as today?s networks support connectivity. This project will develop new scientific foundations for network security, investigate practical use cases, release open-source tools, and produce educational materials. The potential impact of Poise is to make future networks fundamentally more secure than they are today.  <br/><br/>This project presents a vision of Programmable In-network Security, or ?Poise?, informed by the recent trend that network devices are becoming increasingly programmable, and with a goal of supporting security as a first-class network attribute. The project plans to take a three-pronged approach to realizing this goal. First, Poise aims to transform a programmable switch into a defense platform by designing a wide range of security applications that reside in the switch. Second, Poise aims to transform a network of programmable switches into a defense fleet, by architecting defense applications into the network paths and synchronizing them for whole-network defense. Third, Poise seeks to ensure that the defense applications, individually and collectively, are themselves secure against attacks. In its ultimate embodiment, a Poise network would toggle a wide array of defenses rapidly on and off as traffic flows through, mitigating attacks in real time. This project will advance the state of the art in network security in the above three dimensions and will produce scientific foundations and reusable system prototypes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant is in support of an interdisciplinary national two-day workshop that will bring together stakeholders from academia, industry, and government to comprehensively address these calls. Themed topical sessions will discuss the resilient supply of critical minerals from cross-disciplinary, convergent perspectives, including mining engineering, extractive metallurgy, separations, policy, and others. National leaders in their respective fields will give keynote presentations, followed by TED-type talks, panel discussions, and breakout sessions. The breakout sessions will be structured for interdisciplinary engagement, to provide a convergent perspective that includes economic, technical, social, and policy aspects. Research road maps will be created that reflect the cross-disciplinary nature of approaches required to enhance supply resilience. The workshop findings will be summarized and disseminated via a publically-available workshop report. The workshop will be held at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, Missouri, on May 27-28, 2020, and will be followed by an optional field trip on May 29, 2019 that will highlight the critical mineral potential of the Midwestern USA. <br/><br/>The workshop will help nurture a budding national community with expertise in critical mineral supply resilience, spanning academia, industry, and government.

The proposed research has potential to assist researchers with 3D tissue pathology studies and the development of grafts for conditions such as cardiovascular disease and muscle loss. In addition, the proposed research has potential to develop structured meat products that are environmentally sustainable and are produced without use of animal slaughter or antibiotics. These structured meat products can include beef, chicken, pork, or any other type of meat. Their potential applications lie in the fields of animal feed and pet food, consumer meat products, space exploration, and meal ready to eats (MREs) for combat soldiers.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of 3D tissue culture scaffolds to address one of the major limitations in current tissue engineering research: the inability to create vascular networks capable of delivering oxygen throughout engineered tissue. Without proper vascularization, maximum viable tissue thickness is only 100?200 microns. This distance is known as the oxygen diffusion limit and restricts how far cells can survive from a main oxygen source. Current solutions to creating vascular networks have shown only limited success. This research proposes decellularization of common plants such as spinach as a method to develop scaffolds for 3D tissue culture applications. The process of decellularizing plant leaves involves the use of detergents available on the GRAS materials list including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), bleach, tween (polysorbate) 20, water, and tris buffer. The decellularization process removes all cellular and plant material from the leaf, leaving behind a clear, cellulose backbone. Cellulose has been demonstrated to be a biocompatible material capable of cell adhesion. Decellularized plant scaffolds are not only cheaper than conventional decellularized animal-derived and synthetic alternatives, but are edible, easily accessible, familiar to consumers, and easily produced.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vincristine is a chemotherapeutic drug that is central to many treatment regimens involving the most common pediatric cancers. Currently, we are experiencing a vincristine shortage in the United States expected to last through 2020 and there is no drug substitution that has equal efficacy or mode of action.  Children have already been impacted by the current vincristine shortage and it is expected that cancer drug shortages will continue to increase at an alarming rate given the lack of profitability and fragility of the supply chain. Clinicians experience uncertainty in how best to allocate drugs in limited supply, and communicate status updates across institutions. Additionally, it is difficult to assess the health and economic consequences of various shortage scenarios. This study fills an important scientific gap in understanding how decisions regarding drug shortages are made in real time. Modeling and simulating shared decision models have implications for not only the current vincristine drug shortage, but future drug shortages at large, including those represented by pandemic situations. Modeling the health and economic impacts may also have policy implications for regulations supporting the supply chain requirements of critical drugs without substitutions. This project advances the knowledge of assessments of risk and trade-offs in the context of a drug shortage. Additionally, this project identifies information critical to drug shortage communication among clinicians, hospital systems, patients and families impacted by the shortage, drug manufacturers, regulators, and society at large. Tis project advances the development of scientific methods necessary to promote national health and welfare.<br/><br/>By testing shared decision models necessary to guide drug allocation, the investigators will develop a decision framework that can also be applied in practice. Specifically, this project uses a mixed-modal approach of immersive qualitative methods followed by decision analytic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to (1) evaluate current decision-making processes for drug allocation given the vincristine pediatric chemotherapy shortage and (2) use stakeholder-guided decisions and real-world data to model and simulate the clinical and economic outcomes of various drug allocation shortage scenarios. While the lens of this award is focused on the current vincristine shortage, the methods and principles of this work are novel in terms of understanding how decision making and risk communication processes are occurring in the context of uncertainty and lack of alternative treatment strategies. This methodological approach is also used to develop best practices for future decision analysis of drug shortages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current standard of care is organ transplantation, which is beleaguered by a shortage of organs and donors, expensive, and requiring life-long immunosuppression. Alternatively, it may be possible to address the treatment of cardiac problems using tissue engineering (TE).

Physicians still rely on digital palpation, a finger-squeeze test, to assess the pelvic floor, which has marginal clinical reliability. This device can detect small changes in pelvic floor strength and help physicians diagnose a pelvic floor disorder before symptoms arise.  This project will not only focus on the development of this diagnostic device, but also begin assessing the need and commercial opportunity for other products focused on pelvic floor care and rehabilitation. Pelvic health is a largely underserved market and has only recently gained attention through the commercialization of several mobile health training aids.   <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is to explore the development of a vaginal dynamometer, based on a reusable speculum coupled with a removable sensor to assess pelvic floor strength. The results from this device showed that a removable sensor design provides accurate results while reducing the cost-per-use to an acceptable level for routine use. The major limiting factor of current pelvic floor assessment technologies is the cost of use. Perineometers, ultrasound, and MRI are prohibitively costly for routine use in regular gynecologic checkups. The removable sensor design allows the patient-contacting portion of the device to undergo standard reprocessing protocols, such as autoclave, while the fragile sensor and electronics are removed and reused. We believe that such a design would become accessible for routine gynecologic use and could become a vital sign of pelvic health, much like blood pressure is for cardiovascular health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They will build an improved prototype detector with more than ten times the number of pixels and demonstrate its sensitivity and scalability.<br/><br/>This project will develop kilo-pixel arrays of polarization-sensitive Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) that are sensitive to submillimeter radiation in the range 130-280 GHz.  MKIDs operate by using superconducting resonators whose resonant frequency changes when incident photons break Cooper pairs in the device.  Changes in resonance are monitored by a probe tone that drives the resonator.  Each detector can have a unique resonance, which enables multiplexing many pixels onto a single output signal.  Such multiplexing may enable very large arrays of detectors.  Johnson and collaborators will develop a new MKID design using manganese doped aluminum, which has been used successfully in another detector technology.  They will scale up their existing 23 element design to a 331 element module.  They will test this prototype and demonstrate that multiplexing factors of ~1000 are achievable.  Finally, they will expand the fabrication pipeline to enable production of more devices.   This project will demonstrate the performance of these MKIDs to be comparable to competing technology and demonstrate its potential to advance beyond current technology, especially in terms of scalability for large arrays."

The Internet of Nano Things promises to connect a new generation of sensors, transducers, data processors and communication devices for a smart and connected world.  A vital component of all nanodevices is transparent conductive films, generally made of silver nanowires.  Current manufacture of silver nanowires is costly as it involves multi-step batch production.  This award investigates a new approach for large-scale manufacture of silver nanowires with direct coupling with a three-dimensional printing system for patterning of transparent conducting films.  The reduced cost of transparent conducting films and print-on-demand silver nanowires hasten the adoption of devices for the Internet of Nano Things, which contributes to the U.S. economy and prosperity.  This research combines aspects of manufacturing, material science, nanotechnology, chemistry, and engineering.  Students actively participate in research thus achieving engineering expertise in advanced manufacturing, which is important to U.S. industry.  Undergraduate and graduate students, particularly from under-represented groups, are encouraged to participate in research and training.<br/><br/>This project studies the reaction conditions and mechanisms in a continuous reactor to produce silver nanowire (AgNW)-based conductive inks that can be continuously printed onto flexible substrates to create transparent conducting films (TCFs) for the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT).  The current batch production of AgNWs involves the costly steps of selective separation and concentration of the desired AgNWs.  In addition, AgNWs are prone to oxidation in harsh environments. This project studies a millifluidic system for the manufacture of monodispersed AgNWs with controllable length and aspect ratio and sufficient concentration for high performance TCFs.  The millifluidic reactor is connected to a 3D printer for continuous manufacture and printing of AgNW-based TCFs with a reduction in cost while maintaining high print quality.  In-situ monitoring of the millifluidic synthesis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy provides fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms.  Mechanistic knowledge of the chemical reactions helps to achieve control over the aspect ratio and yield of the AgNWs.  The AgNWs are modified using Pd nanoparticles via the galvanic replacement of Ag with Pd cations to achieve stability against oxidation. This research advances AgNW TCFs that are low cost, environmentally stable, with flexible/stretchable characteristics needed in applications such as IoNT devices with high potential for advancing the field of flexible electronics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Advanced Manufacturing Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They exhibit large increases in strength compared to larger-scale bulk constituents. In some cases, they display increased ductility, high radiation damage tolerance, shock resistance, and thermal stability; thus showing great potential for applications in a variety of fields. These materials can lead to new performance levels and energy efficiency not achievable with current materials and thus can have a significant economic impact. However, a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the properties of metallic nano layered composites severely limits our current ability to process and tailor them.

The specific research objectives are: (i) to explore the influence of dislocation-interface interactions on the strength of metallic nanolayered composites; (ii) to investigate the effects of the interface structure and layer thickness on the ductility and plastic instability; (iii) to identify the roles of interface structure and material properties of constituents in the texture evolution during the accumulative roll bonding process; (iv) to reveal the microscopic mechanisms for cyclic deformation behavior of metallic nanolayered composites. The research results will provide insights into the interaction between dislocations and interfaces and their interplay with macroscopically applied fields.

For example, the poleward expansion of herbivore populations can lead to the consumption of habitat-forming vegetation, which alters the ecological services provided by coastal environments (a phenomenon known as tropicalization). Many of the habitats at risk, such as kelp forest and seagrass beds, provide foundational habitat that supports complex food webs. Seagrass meadows along the Gulf of Mexico are currently experiencing an influx of tropical grazers, however a integrated understanding of how these communities might ultimately respond is lacking. This project describes the first experiment to quantify the disruptive effect of tropicalization on the ecology of a widely-distributed seagrass. A major contribution of this project will be the development of a seagrass research collaborative network to serve as a platform for broader scientific inquiry and future collaboration. The collaboration spans a total of 11 institutions, and this network will foster extensive collaborations among junior and senior scientists, as well as many undergraduate and graduate students. Given the geographic scope of this work, the research team will further pursue outreach opportunities across the network by hosting a series of public lectures and science caf events promoting topics in marine ecology and conservation. <br/><br/>This study will develop a large-scale manipulative experiment across the Caribbean, premised upon a comparative network of 15 marine sites, which will quantify how temperature and light interact with grazer effects on the dominant tropical seagrass, Thalassia testudinum. Sites have been selected along a latitudinal gradient (from Bermuda to Panama), such that light and temperature vary, allowing the investigators to test for the effects of abiotic factors on the ecological effects of increased grazing (tropicalization simulated via artificial leaf clipping). At each of the 15 marine sites, grazing treatments will be crossed with nutrient manipulations in a factorial design for 18 weeks, after which seagrass structure and functioning will be assessed via measurements of areal productivity, shoot density, aboveground biomass, and carbohydrate storage. Experiments will be conducted both in the summer and winter seasons, when abiotic gradients are at their weakest and strongest, respectively. Emerging statistical techniques in hierarchical mixed modeling and structural equation modeling will further allow for integration of experimental and observational data."

Although tornadoes are known to produce some of the strongest winds on earth, sufficient understanding of the magnitude, frequency, and structure of these violent winds remains elusive. To effectively design structures that provide protection for life and property against tornadoes, it is necessary to better understand the wind speeds in tornadoes, the interaction of tornado winds with structures, and the likelihood of tornado occurrences.  At the small scale, this research will employ cutting-edge technologies, such as laser scanning and digital imaging, to create highly detailed, 3D digital models of tornado-damaged structures.  The research will also examine large-scale tornado phenomena by using earth-observing satellite images to help detect ""missing"" (unobserved) tornadoes. Improved characterization of regional tornado climates, wind structures, and wind speeds will improve tornado forecast models and risk-based design methodologies. Heightened understanding of tornado hazard will advance society's ability to plan for, and rapidly respond and recover from, disasters, thus promoting national welfare and prosperity. This project also will provide a platform to enhance STEM education in a large rural portion of West Texas by encouraging the pursuit of graduate education through engaging undergraduate students in research collaborations with U.S. and international research institutions and an expansive Natural Hazards Workshop/Symposium series that will bring researchers from academia, government, and industry to campus to inspire students to pursue research and innovation for challenging natural hazard mitigation problems.  Data from this project will be archived and shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) DesignSafe Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>The objectives of this CAREER award are the achievement of rapid and comprehensive multi-scale wind damage assessments through remote sensing, advancement of understanding of tornado-structure interaction, and inspiration and training of students for vital roles in securing national welfare and prosperity through minimizing life and property losses from wind hazards. Through strategic research collaborations, the Principal Investigator and undergraduate student researchers will explore tornado actions via remote sensing technologies at multiple scales.  At small scales, reality-capture-enhanced modeling of tornado-induced failures of engineered steel structures will utilize 3D reality-capture platforms (photogrammetry and lidar) and optimization of these platforms to balance the breadth and depth of detailed forensic analyses of damaged structures (in collaboration with the Texas Tech University National Wind Institute). This modeling will then be used to investigate tornado impacts on structures through the measurement of deflections and study of failure patterns. At the large scale, the project will investigate a methodology to detect ""missing"" tornadoes via multi-spectral image analysis to enhance tornado climatology in sparsely populated and forested areas (in collaboration with Western University in Canada). The research will advance the knowledge of complex tornado-structure interactions, estimation of tornado intensity, and detection of tornado occurrences via safe, reliable, efficient, and cutting-edge remote sensing technologies at spatial scales ranging from minute structural deformations to the overall tornado-path level. The research will provide validation methods for physical and numerical tornado load simulations, facilitate necessary adjustments to wind speed estimates in the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and explore optimization of high-resolution imaging platforms to most effectively advance the understanding of tornado effects on the built environment. Detection of ""missing"" tornadoes will enhance climatology studies, providing a basis to improve forecasts, warnings, and risk models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, without being able to deliver a faithful force-displacement response, virtual surgical training is hardly effective and provides users with misleading experiences.  In the past decade, the number of simulation degrees of freedom (DOFs) for deformable models has increased from hundreds to hundreds-of-thousands and even millions.  Computing hardware that has become more and more powerful has contributed significantly to this development, but unfortunately it is unlikely that in the future computer simulation will continue to benefit dramatically from increased processor frequency.  Indeed, in the last few years the chip industry has already moved the emphasis from a faster processor clock to multi-core architectures.  On the other hand, with the widespread adoption of advanced acquisition devices/techniques, the complexity and scale of the data that can be handled by computers have grown exponentially, and large-scale geometries are becoming ubiquitous in modern 3D data processing.  This new era of data explosion imposes unprecedented challenges on deformable simulation.  Existing methods typically use one-stop solvers that calculate all the unknown DOFs of a system, but that is computationally intensive due to the underlying high-dimensional numerical integration.  Even with state-of-the-art hardware, deformable simulation can still take hours, days, or even weeks for massive scenarios.  <br/><br/>Clearly, conventional simulation methodologies fail to well accommodate distributed computing resource allocation, and become more and more cumbersome with bigger and bigger datasets.  This calls for rebranded algorithmic frameworks and dedicated numerical procedures for large-scale geometrically-complex and nonlinear deformable models that empower next-generation graphics applications.  Motivated by these grand challenges, this project systematically investigates a collection of theoretical advancements, computational techniques, and numerical implementations that push the frontier of large-scale nonlinear deformable models to ""post Moore's law.""  Specifically, the intellectual merit of the research will comprise the following aspects:<br/>o   The project will devise a theoretically grounded domain decomposition based parallel deformable simulator.  By weakening inter-domain linkages, the domain-level computations become independent and parallelizable.  The coupling mechanism will be generalized and enriched so that non-conforming and overlapping domain decompositions are made possible.  This includes an in-depth optimization of the domain tessellation under specified hardware configurations.  Simulation reusability will be further enhanced through a novel technique called cellular domains.<br/>o   The project will deepen the current understanding of large-scale model reduction and re-forge this useful tool in the context of parallel computing.  In particular, how to utilize power iteration to obtain the spectral analysis will be explored.  Furthermore, geometry-based reduction directly dictates reduced DOFs and has a more robust simulation even under imposed extreme constraints.<br/>o   A well-argued computational theory is less practicable unless encapsulated by a set of carefully engineered implementations.  Accordingly, the project will also design customized numerical procedures paired with proposed algorithmic techniques, and the entire simulation framework will be fine-tuned at the system level, solver level, and sub-solver level by leveraging unique data patterns, numerical behaviors, and problem structures of domain decomposed deformable models.<br/>o   As a testbed platform, the project will develop a novel real-time human tongue motion visualization system.  Over 8% of U.S. children have a communication or swallowing disorder.  Built upon the new deformation solver, an ultrasound-imaging-driven real-time human tongue visualization system will be developed to assist doctors and speech therapists to better understand the pathological mechanism behind this disease and plan more effective subject-specific medical/physical treatments."

The audio data will be used to analyze the student-teacher discussions for effectiveness of the student-teacher discussions in student learning. As the effectiveness measures are developed, feedback for instructional improvement will be provided to the teachers in a design cycle for continuous improvement. The technological innovations are in the analysis of the student-teacher discussions, in natural language understanding of student-teacher discussions, and in machine learning to classify effective from non-effective student-teacher discussions.<br/><br/>This project will advance cyber-enabled, teacher analytics as a new genre of technology that provides automated feedback on teacher performance with the goal of improving teaching effectiveness and student achievement.

The project emphasizes six theoretical dimensions of discourse linked to student achievement growth: goal clarity, disciplinary concepts, and strategy use for teacher-led discourse, and challenge, connection, and elaborated feedback for transactional discourse. The innovation aims to help teachers develop expertise on these dimensions and will be developed and tested in 9th grade classrooms in Western Pennsylvania. The team will first generate initial insights on how teacher discourse predicts student achievement via a re-analysis of large volumes (128 hours) of existing classroom audio. Next, they will design and iteratively refine hardware/software interfaces for efficient,flexible, scalable audio data collection by teachers. The data will be used to computationally model dimensions of effective discourse by combining linguistic, discursive, acoustic, and contextual analysis ofaudio with supervised and semi-supervised deep recurrent neural networks. The model-based estimates will be incorporated into an interactive analytic/visualization platform to promote data-driven reflective practice.

While promising, smart and intelligent data interpretation via deep learning is extremely power hungry. To conduct power-efficient deep learning on battery-constrained edge platforms, one promising solution is to use hardware accelerators built with emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) devices, which offer high density, extremely low power consumption, as well as in-situ and parallelized data processing. While these advances are enticing, NVM devices also impose extra challenges, as their design and manufacturing technology are far less mature than CMOS. Furthermore, NVM technologies are likely to exhibit new types of errors, such as read/write disturbance, values drifting over time, and short data retention time. These errors can accumulate while the accelerator is running a deep learning application, and without careful mitigation could lead to significant accuracy degradation. To assuage these concerns, this project will develop a self-healing framework for NVM-based neural network accelerators integrating a test, diagnosis, and recovery loop that monitors and maintains the health of the accelerator. Results of this project will (1) deepen the understanding of interactions among hardware defects and errors, NVM-based accelerators, and machine learning, (2) increase community awareness of post-fabrication error debugging and fixing techniques, (3) enrich the computer engineering course curriculum, and (4) train and promote students of diverse backgrounds for both the workforce and research.<br/> <br/>This project will investigate, characterize, and mitigate errors that will affect the adoption of NVM-based neural network accelerators. While existing solutions focus on fixing errors observed at fabrication time, this project targets the NVM-specific errors that will occur over the life of the accelerator, not just at the time of manufacturing. The project will lead to four outcomes, namely, (1) measurement and characterization of the error resilience capability of neural networks with different topologies and data types, (2) cost-effective approaches for deploying neural networks alongside NVM-based accelerators which exhibit new and diverse error patterns without involving costly retraining, (3) methods for generating neural network inputs as test vectors which will be tuned to be sensitive to different levels of error accumulation and accuracy loss and will provide real-time accelerator health statistics, and (4) an algorithm and device level co-diagnosis procedure which identifies and protects the most critical and vulnerable components of the neural network and the accelerator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to address such concerns by equipping autonomous systems with an additional layer of intelligence allowing them to be resilient-by-cognition.<br/><br/>The research addresses resilience for autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) by integrating concepts from game theory, formal methods, and controls. Our proposed approach includes: (i) a principled framework for formally reasoning about cognitive CPS; that is, given a set of strategies captured in a formal language (e.g., temporal logic), the proposed framework builds on ideas from evolutionary game theory to understand which strategies lead to the best fit when operating in adversarial environments (ii) On-the-fly, correct-by-design feedback controller synthesis that executes the chosen strategy while satisfying physical constraints imposed by the micro-dynamics of the underlying CPS (iii) a data-driven strategy-mining approach that addresses the fundamental problem of designing the library of strategies from human demonstrations. We will illustrate our approach over key applications including self-driving cars and autonomous drone swarms. Our educational plan engages not only graduate students but also high school and undergraduate students. It also reaches out to engineers and the lay public, by providing open source implementations of our algorithms making them available both to industry and independent developers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most important problems in the study of geometric flows is to understand all possible singularities of the flows, which are in turn modeled by self-similar solutions of the flows. The proposed research on the moduli space of such self-similar solutions is expected to broaden and advance the knowledge and techniques both within and outside of mathematics, such as the topology of manifolds, image processing, crystal growths and the large-scale structure of the universe. In the meanwhile, new ideas and tools will be developed in various mathematical disciplines ranging from differential geometry to analysis.

The PI will also actively participate in the promotion of women in mathematics to enhance diversity and gender equity in the society.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposed project is to establish various geometric and analytic properties of the space of self-similar solutions of geometric flows. First, the PI, in the continuing collaboration with Brett Kotschwar at the Arizona State University, will apply the Carleman type technique to attack the rigidity problem for noncompact gradient Ricci solitons. Second, appealing to the tools inspired in part by the theory of minimal surfaces, the PI aims to describe a much detailed picture of two-dimensional smooth noncompact self-shrinkers of finite genus of mean curvature flow. To achieve this, the PI will begin with investigating the asymptotic structures at infinity of such self-shrinkers which are conjectured to be regular cones or cylinders. Then the PI intends to address the Cylinder Rigidity Conjecture of Ilmanen concerning the uniqueness of self-shrinking cylinders. At the end, the PI, with Joel Spruck at the Johns Hopkins University, plans to seek the sufficient and necessary conditions of the existence of the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for the self-shrinker equation. Third, in higher dimensions, the PI, joint with Neshan Wickramasekera at the University of Cambridge, will extend the regularity theory of stable minimal submanifolds to derive estimates on the size of singular sets of entropy stable weak self-shrinkers."

Arterial stiffness is largely determined by the function of vascular smooth muscle cells. When vascular smooth cells become dysfunctional, they begin to proliferate and remodel the blood vessel to make it stiffer by degrading elastin and depositing collagen. While this transition is well established, the mechanisms that trigger smooth muscle cells to change and stiffen arteries is not understood. This research hypothesizes that this vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction is mediated by the adipose (fat) tissue that is present surrounding the arteries. This fat, known as perivascular adipose tissue, directly surrounds large blood vessels, where it produces and releases factors that have recently been shown to impact the blood vessel wall. The goal of this project is to investigate how perivascular adipose tissue inflammation and sympathetic nervous system activity impact aortic stiffening. The research team will determine how perivascular adipose tissue impacts vascular smooth muscle cell function (phenotype) in both an artery-on-a-chip and in spinal cord injured mice. Spinal cord injury is an interesting model for arterial stiffening, since patients with chronic spinal cord injury have stiffer arteries despite normal blood pressure. Knowledge gained through this project could lead to improved diagnostic and treatment strategies for arterial stiffening and cardiovascular disease.  In addition, this project will expand the opportunities available for undergraduate students to participate in research experiences. Specifically, the research team will incorporate this research project into a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE), in which the entire class addresses a research question of interest to the scientific community. This course will then be translated into educational cardiovascular biomechanics modules for high school students.<br/><br/>Two research objectives have been established to support this project.  First, the work will determine how perivascular adipose tissue inflammation contributes to arterial stiffening.  Using a mouse model of spinal cord injury, the research will quantify changes in arterial stiffness, perivascular adipose tissue inflammation, expression and activity of MMP-12 (an enzyme that degrades elastin), as well as elastin content and fragmentation.  Second, the researchers will determine how sympathetic nervous system activity associated with perivascular adipose tissue contributes to arterial stiffening.  A similar mouse model with spinal cord injury will be used to quantify changes in arterial stiffness, perivascular adipose tissue sympathetic nervous system activity, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, arterial thickness, and collagen content.  An artery-on-a-chip model will be used to support both objectives by determining how adipokines secreted by perivascular adipose tissue, when it is either inflamed or stimulated by norepinephrine, affects vascular smooth muscle cells as well as how endothelial cells may mediate this effect.  In addition, two educational objectives will introduce cardiovascular engineering to undergraduate and high school students through course-based research activities as well as outreach modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be achieved by studying a set of tasks inspired by research of arm control. The expected findings will have broad implications for human walking flexibility in health and disease, because motor learning and rehabilitation are thought to share similar mechanisms.

Due to recent advances in data collection, frequently one has access to datasets which contain a massive number of predictors, but with correspondingly few subjects. This setting is generally referred to as the ""big P, small n"" scenario. Drawing meaningful conclusions under such circumstances is generally impossible unless the underlying data satisfy certain structural assumptions. The simplest such structural assumption is that only a small number of the predictors are relevant; in this setting, finding the useful predictors corresponds to finding a so-called ""needle in a haystack."" The goal of this project is to construct procedures which adapt to this, and other, structural assumptions. The project will focus on methods based on decision trees, which are flowchart-like structures in which predictions are based on whether the predictors satisfy various rules. Usually an ensemble of decision trees are constructed, with the predictions for each individual tree averaged. While decision tree ensembles are frequently used with high dimensional data, it is unclear to what extent they adapt to the structural properties of the data. This project will show that, in practice, off-the-shelf decision tree ensembling methods do not adapt to common structural assumptions, and will develop new methods which do. In addition to developing methods with strong theoretical support, this project will support the development of an R package to give practitioners easy access to our methodology.<br/><br/>    <br/>The PI will develop Bayesian methods for incorporating structural information into tree-based ensemble methods, and establish theoretically the benefit of making use of this additional information. This forms a nonparametric counterpart to the parametric approaches used in linear models, such as the lasso, graphical lasso, or group lasso; Bayesian approaches in the parametric setting include the use of variable selection priors, such as spike-and-slab priors and global-local shrinkage priors. Structural information will be incorporated by modifying the commonly used priors on decision tree ensembles so that the prior is concentrated on models which satisfy the desired structure. The PI will first investigate the theoretical properties of a sparsity inducing prior which is designed to eliminate unnecessary predictors. Sparsity here is obtained by applying a sparsity inducing Dirichlet prior to the a priori probability that a given branch is associated to a given predictor. This prior will be extended to allow for grouped variable selection in a similar manner to the group lassoby considering the class of Dirichlet tree priors, and further to accommodate graphical structures in the predictors through sparsity inducing logistic normal priors. Additionally, the PI will develop computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to fit the resulting models. Compared to existing methods, these structural priors will be shown to lead to substantial gains in predictive accuracy, and to more accurate scientific discovery."

When certain liquid metals come into contact with specific solid metals, the solid metals can undergo a catastrophic reduction in strength and/or ductility; this is termed ""liquid metal embrittlement."" While liquid metal embrittlement has been studied for over a century, a full understanding of the phenomenon is lacking. There is currently no means to predict the occurrence or severity of liquid metal embrittlement under given conditions. The PIs aim to use a method where computers can ""learn"" from the data obtained from many studies to create a model that can predict the severity of liquid metal embrittlement as a function of the experimental conditions, including liquid composition, solid composition, temperature, deformation rate, and microscopic structure of the solid metal which is largely visible through powerful optical microscopes. The machine learning model created as part of this research may enable the use of liquid metals in engineering applications, such as in stretchable circuits, and allow for future study of the fundamental physical mechanisms responsible for liquid metal embrittlement. The project strongly emphasizes the education and professional development of students of all ages. Graduate and undergraduate researchers with a materials science background will be trained in both conventional laboratory skills and in data science methods for engineers. Additionally, outreach modules targeted to middle and high school students will be developed as part of this project and distributed to the broader community through programs including the Minorities in Engineering Program and The Engineering Place at North Carolina State University.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This EAGER award supports research and education involving a new collaboration kindled at the MATDAT18 Datathon event focused on using the methods of data science to make progress on challenging problems in materials science, in the mechanisms of case liquid metal embrittlement. To date, no predictive phenomenological or mechanistic models of liquid metal embrittlement have been successfully developed. The phenomenon of liquid metal embrittlement is incredibly complex, with embrittlement behavior shown to depend on nearly every experimental variable ever tested including temperature, strain rate, solid metal grain size, solid composition, liquid composition, and more. Due to this complex phenomenology and the experimental challenge of independently varying the large number of involved, purely empirical studies of liquid metal embrittlement are intractable.  This project takes an alternative approach to establish a predictive liquid metal embrittlement model: the Citrination platform will be used to conduct sequential learning. In this approach, an initial model is trained using preliminary data and used to suggest the next round of experiments which will have the greatest likelihood of improving the predictive capability of the model. The PI recently developed an initial model trained on data extracted from the literature. The model was used to suggest preliminary experiments, which were conducted and used to refine the model. However, further iterations are required for the model to achieve predictive capability. The PIs aim to iteratively refine the model. Once the model has sufficient predictive capability, a second objective of this work is to test the hypothesis that liquid metal embrittlement is not a monolithic phenomenon but is composed of several distinct mechanisms. The last main objective of this work is to identify ""archetypal"" systems for each identified potential mechanism and ideal candidates for future mechanistic study. If the hypothesis of multiple mechanisms is supported, this could reconcile seemingly contradictory reports of liquid metal embrittlement behavior present in the literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the global radiative forcing of observation-constrained aerosol impacts on cirrus microphysical properties will be quantified by using a climate model. The project will focus on three critical scientific issues: (1) Hemispheric differences in cirrus cloud macroscopic and microphysical properties under similar dynamical conditions; (2) Multi-scale dynamical forcings driving ice nucleation and their impacts on cirrus simulations in a climate model; and (3) Impacts of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on cirrus microphysical properties and the subsequent influences on global radiation.<br/><br/>To address these scientific issues, The research team will: (1) extract cirrus cloud samples from a composite in-situ dataset covering various geographical locations, and compare the formation and evolution of cirrus clouds between two hemispheres; (2) examine the micro- to mesoscale (~0.1-10 km) variabilities of water vapor and temperature, and improve the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) by including these observed variabilities; (3) compare the in-situ measured cirrus microphysical properties between polluted and pristine regions, and use CAM5 to quantify the consequent perturbations on global radiation balance.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Cirrus clouds are one of the main modulators of Earth's climate system. However, due to their large spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, cirrus clouds remain one of the poorly-represented components in current general circulation models (GCMs). This project will improve our understanding of cirrus microphysical properties in relation to dynamical conditions and aerosol backgrounds, by analyzing in-situ aircraft data obtained from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, polluted and pristine regions. Furthermore, the research team will use the observed characteristics to evaluate the simulations of relative humidity and cirrus clouds in CAM5 in terms of their occurrence, spatial coverage and microphysical properties. In addition, a ""best-observation-matched"" ice microphysics configuration will be implemented into CAM5.  Overall, using micro- to mesoscale observations of cirrus formation and evolution, the research will improve cirrus cloud simulations in CAM5 and provide a new estimation on cirrus clouds' adjustments due to anthropogenic aerosol emissions (i.e., aerosol indirect forcing through perturbations of cirrus microphysical properties).<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Both the observational dataset and the new model parameterization will be released to the community, including a synthesized in-situ observation dataset (a total of 8 campaigns from NSF, NASA and European Union), and a sub-grid scale parameterization of relative humidity variability for GCMs. The improved estimation of anthropogenic aerosol impact on cirrus cloud radiative forcing can contribute to uncertainty reduction in the next IPCC report. The project will greatly benefit teaching and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students at University of Wyoming and San Jose State University.

The cells and tissues that make up living organisms have material properties just like any other substance. When exposed to mechanical forces, such as pulling or pushing, they stretch and change shape. They can even generate these forces themselves.  The material properties of cells are controlled by the cytoskeleton, a collection of filamentous proteins. This network of filaments gives cells their shape, much like the skeleton defines the human shape. In cells, however, this network is dynamic and adaptive, reorganizing itself to help cells perform various functions or to resist outside mechanical stresses. The cytoskeleton thus represents a new class of material that doesn't obey the traditional models of engineering materials. It can modulate its material properties in both space and time.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will determine how the cell is able to spatially and temporally regulate its material properties and unearth novel design principles that can be used to develop new engineering materials and to understand how some diseases affect cell behavior. Sitting at the interface between physics, biology, and engineering, this multi-disciplinary work will inform research across a broad spectrum of fields. Most importantly, it will create opportunities for a diverse set of students and young researchers to develop innovative skills and perspectives, in particular learning to communicate novel methods and ideas across disciplines. <br/><br/>The cytoskeleton is a model system for developing insights into non-equilibrium mechanics and network dynamics, and is known to both generate and respond to mechanical signals. Despite the fact that the principal molecular biochemical interactions have been well detailed, we still lack an understanding of how macroscopic scale behaviors emerge from the collection of many molecular interactions. Septins are the least studied filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. They bind to both actin and the plasma membrane, and have been shown to localize specifically to regions of actin curvature and mechanical stress. This research project will test the hypothesis that septins help to regulate the material properties of the cytoskeleton by altering the local architecture. This work will measure the material properties of septin-actin networks in both living cells and purified protein networks, and test the response of these networks to mechanical perturbations such as micropatterning to control cell shape, traction force microscopy, and optogenetics to induce local contractions. In addition to potentially uncovering novel mechanisms to regulate cell shape, this work will also generate insight into how molecular interactions in a network are integrated into macroscopic behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common situation for analysts is needing to manage multiple views of a dataset at the same time, raising questions of how visual analysis tools can help analysts see relationships between separate views. Current tools require extensive effort, such as repetitively selecting individual nodes in a graph and manually following information highlighted in a histogram, scatterplot, and map to identify abnormal behaviors. This project will investigate methods for analytics tools to flexibly and unobtrusively display relationships across multiple visualizations for supporting data analytics. Doing this will deepen our scientific understanding of how multiple visualizations support sensemaking of data and expand the design space of multi-view visualizations. The work will also enrich educational materials in data science and human-centered computing courses.<br/><br/>This project includes four major lines of work. First, the team will design a usable overview of cross-view data relationships, supported by computations, for helping users to relate information from multiple visualizations. This design highlights a core concept of ""context separation"", which creates stand-alone views to plot computed, cross-view data relationships instead of relying on displayed visual elements. Second, the researchers will create a novel layout method for spatially organizing multiple visualizations by considering data relationships among them. Third, the team will develop novel user interactions for manipulating displayed cross-view data relationships, including merging and splitting, to support both analysis and navigation. Fourth, the team will conduct user experiments to study the effectiveness and cognitive load of these cross-view data relationship visualizations. In addition, techniques developed in this project will be open-sourced, so researchers, data scientists, practitioners, and educators can use, extend or modify them for data analysis, tool development, and teaching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many times this results from a lack of clarity regarding the task at hand, or the way an information or search system works. In addition, people may not know what they do not know. The former is addressed by search systems by providing recommendations, whereas there are no good solutions for the latter problem. Even when a search system makes recommendations, they are limited to suggesting objects such as queries and documents only. They do not consider providing suggestions for strategies, people, or processes. This project will address such problems by investigating the nature of the work a person is doing, predicting the potential problems they may encounter, and providing help to overcome those problems. Such a help could be an object such as a document or a query, a strategy, or a person. This whole process is referred to as Information Fostering. Beyond creating a general-purpose recommender system, Information Fostering is an idea for providing proactive suggestions and help to information seekers. This could allow them to avoid potential problems and capture promising opportunities in search before it is too late. In order to meet these goals, the project will carry out three lab studies. Through these studies, a new system will be created. This system will be integrated in a user's Web browser to provide real-time assessment of the information seeking process, as well as recommendations for queries, documents, strategies, and people. The outcomes of this project will make it possible and easier for a user with even low information literacy to be able to leverage the power of information. Such users may use information for multiple life contexts, including healthcare (e.g. caring for a sick family member), financial well-being (e.g., deciding on an investment portfolio), work (e.g., reviewing a business proposition), and education (e.g., compiling a report).<br/><br/>Current systems face challenges in understanding the problems that information seekers face due to their inability to express their information needs, recognizing a potential problem during a search episode, and identifying support needed that goes beyond what a typical search system could provide. Most recommender systems try to mitigate these problems by suggesting information objects (queries, documents), disregarding a deeper understanding of the task at hand or the possibility of recommendations that involve process/strategy, people, and other forms. The project will advance our understanding of these information-seeking problems at the task level, and of when and how help could be offered to information seekers. The offered help would go beyond recommending alternative queries and documents and would include recommending search strategies. This will be done in three phases with different user studies: (1) extracting the nature of task, problems, and help to build Task Model and Problem-Help Model; (2) testing the validity of Task Model and Problem-Help Model in being able to detect tasks, problems, and help; and (3) creating an Information Fostering system and evaluating its effectiveness in various search tasks. There will be three major intellectual outcomes: (1) Task Model that detects the nature of a search task using implicit signals such as browsing behaviors; (2) Problem-Help Model that uses behavioral data and other contextual factors, including the nature of the task, to explicate possible problems and potential solutions without explicitly asking from the searchers; and (3) a general-purpose recommender system framework, called Information Fostering, that proactively creates recommendations in real time for enhancing one's information seeking process and helping one avoid potential problems or grab an opportunity before it is too late. The results from this project will be disseminated through the project website, which will include technical reports, publications, and links to datasets and open-source software developed in this project."

These data sets often contain intrinsic, nonlinear, low-dimensional structure hidden in complex high-dimensional input representations.<br/>  To uncover such structure one needs to adapt to local changes in scale, recognize multiscale structure, represent the intrinsic space underlying the data, compute with coarse approximate distances, and integrate heterogeneous data into meaningful distance functions. There is a need for algorithms and data structures that can search, represent, and summarize such data sets efficiently.  The PI will develop new data structures, models of computation, sampling theories, sampling algorithms, and metrics for addressing these challenges.<br/>  <br/>  The specific aim of the project is to adapt hierarchical metric data structures to work with locally adaptive distances using new models of computation that only use approximate distance comparisons.  These models acknowledge the reality that with sufficiently complex data, even a single distance computation can be expensive.  A second specific aim is to develop new multiscale sampling theories as well as new algorithms for computing such samples.  These samples and sampling algorithms will be applicable to a wide range of problems and will extend and generalize greedy and farthest-point strategies.

Low-dimensional topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are the dimensions that are substantially least understood. One-and two-dimensional spaces are ""small"" enough that nothing interesting can happen; five-dimensional spaces are ""large"" enough that interesting things have room to become uninteresting. A major question in low-dimensional topology is the structure of the homology cobordism groups, groups of three-dimensional spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere. This group has deep connections to the substantial difference between the topological and smooth categories in four-dimensions, and to structural issues in higher dimensional topology. In the past thirty years, substantial progress on this and other central topological questions has been made using invariants from gauge theory (which deals with solutions of partial differential equations from physics) and Floer theory (which deals with rigid curves in spaces with a notion of area). This project will use tools from Floer theory to study the homology cobordism groups and other topological questions, and to undertake new theoretical work in Floer theory that will produce useful tools for low-dimensional topology. In parallel to the research component, the project includes plans to further the PI's mentoring and outreach efforts, with a focus on increasing the accessibility of mathematics at early stages and on building pedagogical and mentorship skills in young researchers.  These plans include an extending Michigan State University's existing undergraduate research program, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and arranging for workshops for building academic communication skills. <br/><br/><br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of invariants from Floer theory. The first part of the project uses an equivariant version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology constructed by the Principal Investigator and C. Manolescu, which gives new invariants of homology cobordism. The Principal Investigator plans to construct a refinement of this theory, in analogy with work done in parallel gauge-theoretic invariants, and use it to address questions of torsion and indivisibility of elements in the homology cobordism group. The second part of the project focuses on Lagrangian Floer homology, the symplectic geometry construction underlying Heegaard Floer homology and many other topological invariants. Equivariant versions of Lagrangian Floer cohomology that incorporate the information of a Z/2Z-symmetry have been extensively and fruitfully developed in the past six years, including by the Principal Investigator. However, the literature lacks an analogous theory for Z/pZ-symmetries. With R. Lipshitz and S. Sarkar, the Principal Investigator plans to construct one, and to use it to study many situations in low-dimensional topology that possess natural symmetries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the Honda ASIMO can walk over stairs and navigate around obstacles but needs to be recharged about every hour or so. On the other hand, robots inspired by passive dynamics use trivial amounts of energy to move but are limited to a single speed and step length. This project develops a theory that fills this knowledge gap by enabling bipedal robots to make informed decisions about what strategy to follow given a particular circumstance. For example, on rough terrains, a robot may have to decide to expend more energy in order to maximize stability while, in cases where the terrain is flat and regular, the same robot can decide to use its most energy-efficient gait while paying little heed to stability.<br/><br/>There is a need to develop a theory that would simultaneously enable improved performance metrics for the energy-efficiency and versatility of bipedal robots. The instability of bipedal robots, due to their inverted pendulum like nature, makes this challenge even greater; hence, metrics for balance and stability also need to be met simultaneously. The gap in knowledge is that, it is unclear how to enable bipedal robots to satisfy all these performance metrics, some of which can actually be conflicting (e.g., energy-efficiency trade-offs with stability)."

Applications can perform traditional memory load and store instructions to access both local and remote data in this global memory space and can at the same time make their data persistent and reliable.

Women leave doctoral programs in STEM at higher rates than their white male counterparts.  Reducing the attrition of these talented individuals from STEM is of particular importance given that diversity at all levels of the STEM workforce has been shown to benefit the outcomes of related scientific research.  The proposed work will increase understanding of the reasons for the underrepresentation of women in STEM academic and research careers.  Key research findings will be incorporated in the online CareerWISE resilience training intervention and will provide the foundation for informing and educating key support sources about how to strengthen support for women in STEM.<br/><br/>The project addresses the overarching research question of: How do experiences of perceived support play a role in the academic persistence of diverse female doctoral students in STEM? The project proposes three studies, each of which utilizes different research methods, and are guided by the theoretical lens of Social Cognitive Career Theory.  The ""reflections study"" will produce qualitative data about the nature of support episodes, and the sources, types, and timing of interpersonal support that were most effective in mitigating discouragement and stresses from difficulties experienced in STEM doctoral programs. The lab-based ""communications of support"" study will provide real-time observations of how support is communicated between a faculty mentor and an advanced stage doctoral student. Finally, the ""first and second year support experiences"" study will assess support experiences that take place during the critical early stages of doctoral study. Participants in the studies will include current STEM doctoral students, early career professionals who have recently graduated from doctoral programs, and women who left their STEM doctoral programs prior to completing their degrees. Data across the studies will be collected from interviews, surveys, daily journals, and lab-based observation.  The project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program (ECR), which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, designing effective mechanisms for censorship resistance ultimately depends on accurate models of the capabilities of censors, as well as how those capabilities will likely evolve. In contrast to more established disciplines within security, censorship resistance is relatively nascent, not yet having solid foundations for understanding censor capabilities or evaluating the effectiveness of evasion technologies. Consequently, the censorship resistance tools that researchers develop may ultimately fail to serve the needs of citizens who need them to communicate. Designers of these tools need a principled foundation for reasoning about design choices and tradeoffs. <br/><br/>To provide such a foundation, this project develops a science of censorship resistance: principled approaches to understanding the nature of censorship and the best ways to facilitate desired outcomes. The approach draws upon empirical studies of censorship as the foundation for models and abstractions to allow us to reason about the censorship-resistant technologies from first principles. The project aims to characterize and model censorship activities ranging from blocked search results to interference with international network traffic. The research develops theoretical models of censorship; reconciles these with large-scale empirical measurements; and uses these observations to design censorship-resistance tools to deploy in practice, as both components of Tor and standalone systems."

Because of growing national engineering workforce demands, it is critical that the United States find ways to broadening participation among underrepresented groups, such as African American males. This CAREER project, which represents the largest aggregation of qualitative data on Black males in engineering graduate programs, will contribute to the field's understanding of how African American males develop their perceptions of what it means to be an engineer (i.e., develop an engineering identity). It is also likely to pinpoint key mechanisms that improve their academic retention and success in engineering, particularly at the graduate level. Further, the project proposes to contribute to the development of a new learning and identity theory on Black men in engineering. The findings from this work have immense implications for transformative change, such as equipping Colleges of Engineering with the needed knowledge and understanding to better serve Black male graduate students and help these students to persist in engineering. Equally important, the new theory generated from this this project will offer engineering administrators, faculty, and staff important insights on how to broadening engineering participation among African American males. <br/><br/>The qualitative interviews, resulting from this project, will provide the unique opportunity to explore the educational experiences from the perspectives of African American males (e.g., students' agency, persistence factors, etc.) while still enabling analyses of institution-specific cases (e.g., experiences of students at one institution, institutional factors that serve as supports and/or barriers to students' retention), and cross-case analyses (e.g., students' demographic information, students' experiences compared across institutions, systems and structures related to engineering identity and long-term participation, institutional best practices in retention of Black men graduate students). Through the dissemination of findings, all stakeholders (e.g., faculty members, administrators and staff, policymakers, K-12 education leaders, and students) will obtain greater insights and knowledge on Black males' unique experiences in engineering graduate programs and will become better able to serve these students as a result of obtaining this information."

Since available spectrum may be fragmented, carrier aggregation becomes a critical enabling technique. Many recent and emerging protocols (e.g., 802.11ac WiFi, 802.11af TV whitespace networks, 3GPP LTE unlicensed, and 802.11ay millimeter-wave networks) have been incorporating carrier aggregation mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are still preliminary and heavily rely on conventional MAC/PHY which is designed for nodes sharing the same contiguous channel. As carrier aggregation networks evolve to new generations, three inherent problems will become the fundamental barrier to their efficiency, fairness, and scalability: (i) a transmitter is unable to sense medium state during transmission, (ii) more users and high spectrum dynamics worsen the medium access contention, and (iii) the need of fast spectrum agreement to aggregate multiple fragmented spectrum chunks. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to explore general primitives to effectively realize carrier aggregation with three research components: (i) Migrate the spectrum sensing paradigm from ""detect and then transmit"" to ""simultaneously transmit and detect"". The end goal is to overcome the efficiency and fairness problems in standard spectrum sensing mechanisms to enable asynchronous, out-of-band OFDM spectrum sensing and multi-antenna based full-duplex sensing. (ii) Address the contention issue in wideband fragmented spectrum sharing with low collision probabilities and low overhead. A spectrum arbitration mechanism is proposed, enabled by a parallel bitwise signaling scheme and a novel compound packet preamble design. (iii) Design a light-weight in-band mechanism that achieves fast synchronization and spectrum agreement, so as to overcome the substantial control channel overhead for spectrum agreement under high spectrum dynamics. The success of the proposed research will enhance radio spectrum sharing, and inspire standardization bodies to incorporate the proposed new protocol primitives for much higher performance. A continuous effort will be made to integrate the proposed research to education program, to mentor undergraduate researchers, and recruit women and minority students."
