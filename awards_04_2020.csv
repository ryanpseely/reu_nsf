Laboratory and theoretical research has shown that phenotypic plasticity may play an important role in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of species, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. This project will lead to a better understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of phenotypic plasticity by comparing two strains of caterpillars that differ in their response to temperature: one strain remains black at all temperatures and another turns green at higher temperatures. Black caterpillars have lower levels of juvenile hormone than green caterpillars, and the project will elucidate the regulation of this important hormone that controls insect growth and development. Determining the molecular and physiological basis of phenotypic plasticity has important implications for our understanding of environmentally-induced diseases, generation of novel traits, and species conservation. Much of the proposed study will involve female undergraduate researchers from Wellesley College who will be exposed to research in integrative biology. These students will be encouraged to present at national meetings and publish their contribution in peer-reviewed journals. The award will support inquiry-based learning in the classroom, and will also expose undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented groups to scientific research.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the proposed study is to determine the genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of an artificially selected polyphenism. In this study, the transcriptomes of the neuroendocrine complex in a monophenic strain of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and the polyphenic strain will be compared, as these strains differ in the temperature sensitivity of juvenile hormone production. Once candidate temperature-sensitive genes are identified, the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and RNA interference techniques will be used to functionally characterize these genes. The project will uncover the genetic basis of genetic accommodation and identify the molecular nature of hidden genetic variation, which remains poorly understood. It will lead to a mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype-environment interactions and advance understanding of molecular and physiological control of juvenile hormone production. Determining the molecular nature of genetic accommodation and phenotypic plasticity has implications for our understanding of evolution. The findings may also help identify novel regulators of juvenile hormone that could serve as potential targets for pest management. By involving high school and college students in the research and integrating teaching with research, the project also contributes to training the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To aid in this process, state-of-the-art and revolutionary computational tools can be used to simulate new materials, thus providing a thorough understanding of their characteristics and behavior. Such materials simulation efforts can drastically reduce the time-to-market of new materials from decades to months. Traditional simulation approaches can accurately predict the behavioral properties of materials both at the smallest possible scale (atomic) and at the macroscopic level, i.e. millimeter or larger. Many critical materials properties are defined and needed at scales ranging from a few nanometers to micrometers, yet simulations are lacking at these levels. While algorithms do exist to simulate properties at these scales, often we lack the fundamental parameters, termed force-fields, for novel materials such as those for next-generation solar cells, batteries and jet turbine alloys. These force-fields are laborious to determine using traditional methods, requiring significant expertise and thus restricted by the human-in-the-loop. The primary goal of the proposed Deep Potential DataBase (DeepPDB) will be to offer an open-source toolkit with the ability to automatically generate estimates of force-fields parameters using advanced empirical-based computational tools.  We will also curate and disseminate a validated repository of first-principles datasets and their corresponding potentials for inorganic materials. DeepPDB will serve both the materials science and machine learning communities, by providing the former with critical parameters to solve materials challenges and the latter by benchmark datasets for machine learning development. The resulting synergy will enable artificial intelligence and machine learning to play a greater role in computing critical materials properties for next-generation challenges.  DeepPDB will also serve a critical educational objective, allowing the budding of a new generation of materials scientists, who understand how deep learning can be used to solve materials science challenges.                                                                                                                             <br/><br/>DeepPDB aims to build a database of deep neural network potentials (DNP) for the simulation of inorganic materials. In the process DeepPDB will: (1) develop automated workflows that given a target composition, will run the necessary density functional theory (DFT) calculations, train DNPs, validate against metrics imposed by the training data, identify the input-data space with the largest uncertainty and iterate until an optimal DNP is trained; (2) openly disseminate the training DFT data along with the pre-trained DNPs; (3) develop transparent automated validation that encompasses both traditional DNP based methods as well as fully integrated tests that include target metrics. To accomplish this, DeepPDB will build a toolkit based on careful software engineering practices: a combination of feature- and sprint-based development cycles; constant continuous integration using unit-tests and integration tests as milestones; and a database-oriented approach to data and workflow management. The resulting open-source toolkit will serve as a foundational tool to investigate the properties of hitherto-unseen materials at length- and time-scales previously not possible.<br/><br/>This award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research within the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key to their success is that deep neural networks can well approximate these difficult tasks. Unfortunately, the more accurate the approximation, the more resources required.  When deployed on mobile devices or autonomous vehicles those resource needs directly impact people as the time or energy/battery required to produce an answer.  This project tackles this crucial problem by developing sound engineering methods to make disciplined tradeoffs between neural network accuracy and resource usage in software systems. <br/><br/>The proposed work will take an interdisciplinary approach. Its first thrust will design novel neural networks that efficiently produce a series of outputs, instead of just a single output, such that the output accuracy will increase with increasing resources. The second thrust will develop new resource management software that automatically adjusts both underlying system settings and one or multiple neural networks to meet high-level software accuracy and energy requirements. The third will create tools for automatically analyzing the software context where neural networks are used, inferring accuracy and resource requirements for neural networks and identifying inefficient use of neural networks.<br/><br/>The project has the potential to improve the efficiency and reliability of software that incorporates neural networks, and hence improve people's daily life experiences.  Software developers will benefit from greater flexibility in neural network design, greater assurance that the neural networks they deploy will meet their accuracy and resource requirements, and greater understanding of how the neural network impacts the rest of their software systems.  Additionally, the project will create many educational opportunities through enhanced classroom projects and creation of research opportunities for undergraduates, broadening the participation in computing.<br/><br/>All of the data, code, results, and artifacts of this project will be made publicly available through the webpage https://alert.cs.uchicago.edu/.

It will host three cohorts of nine students each summer, engaging 27 unique students. Undergraduate research has been observed to increase students? understanding, confidence, awareness, and interest in STEM subjects. It also enhances intellectual skills, such as inquiry and analysis, reading and understanding primary literature, communication, and teamwork. This REU site will involve students in emerging STEM education research projects that focus on developing engineering students? problem-solving capacity and that address critical aspects of problem solving, including design in engineering.  Through this work, students will learn to become active scientific contributors on collaborative research projects that can lead to publishable discoveries and positive societal outcomes. This REU also leverages opportunities to develop students? leadership and managerial skills as they take leading roles in various aspects of the research. The REU team will focus recruiting efforts on STEM undergraduates who might not otherwise have the opportunity for undergraduate research. By the end of the summer experience, it is expected that each REU student will have developed a foundational understanding of educational research processes. Additionally, they are expected to also have gained a toolbox of social and leadership skills that better prepares them to succeed in their future careers. <br/><br/>The 10-week REU site includes four integrated components: (1) REU research projects; (2) workshops; (3) dissemination of research findings and program results; and (4) off-campus group social and network-building activities. Preparatory work delivered to participants online prior to arriving on campus will allow students to develop an educational research foundation that will increase their research productivity on site. Over a three-year project period, 27 undergraduate students from across the nation will actively participate in an REU Site program working with graduate student and faculty mentors. This program is designed to offer opportunities for each REU participant to engage in authentic and funded research tasks, both individually and collaboratively, as well as an opportunity to gain experience in managing project deliverables.

Despite significant efforts, underrepresented minorities received only 16.1% and women received only 21.9% of engineering degrees in 2018. The reasons for these low numbers are complex and multifaceted and discrimination is an important factor in why students from these groups leave engineering. The goal of this research is to develop a holistic understanding of the impact of discrimination on historically underrepresented engineering students. In this era of big data and readily available technology such as mobile phones and wearables, a comprehensive change in how data about the college student experience are collected and assessed is possible. One can now move from lab to field, connect action to behavior, and collect longitudinal data. This, in turn, makes it possible to understand bias and its impact on engineering education in new ways: By complementing self-reports with passive data collection, big data can be used to create an image of behavior while learning about specific challenges underrepresented minority and female engineering students face. <br/><br/>The project will result in a uniquely powerful longitudinal data set, which captures real-time changes in student experiences and allows study of the impact of discrimination at scale across a variety of contexts. The project will quantify the scope, direction, and longitudinal impact on behavior and link this to long-term outcomes such as GPA and retention. This ability to connect behavior to experience in the field was lacking in past studies of discrimination. Analytic techniques capable of capturing both individual variance and looking at unequal numbers of observations, such as hierarchical linear modeling, are required due to the large sample (N=200/year) and number of variables. The data are collected at a large public university and will be most applicable to similar programs at similar institutions. The research will support policy making and intervention design in engineering programs. The ultimate goal is to diversify the pool of engineering students, which will be of direct benefit to society by increasing representation and the range of perspectives engaged in the engineering and computer science workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Containers are very low-overhead virtual machines, and function-as-a-service environments are systems where users run many small jobs, and are billed as such. In these environments, two major challenges are insecurity due to the lack of isolation, and poor scalability due to the many jobs that are running. This project rethinks the computer architecture and the operating system of machines to support these environments securely and scalably.<br/><br/>This work develops a set of novel, transformative computer architecture and operating system technologies that will dramatically improve the security and the scalability of novel virtualization technologies. On the security side, this project will explore novel hardware and software designs to filter system calls efficiently. The idea is to examine every system call that programs issue at runtime and check and validate their arguments for security. On the scalability side, this project will enable the ability to run thousands of containers or functions on the same machine simultaneously, by redesigning TLBs (Translation Lookaside Buffers) and page tables. Overall, these technologies will enhance cloud computing. <br/><br/>This project will initiate an effort on multidisciplinary research and education on whole-system support for modern virtualization technologies in cloud at the University of Illinois. The efforts in this project include working with the Department of Computer Science to broaden the course offerings with multidisciplinary courses in the general area of cloud computing and datacenter technologies.

It will do so by preparing science and mathematics teachers for diverse classrooms that include students of color, students from low-income families, emerging bilingual students, and/or students with special needs. Many students from these groups have less access to grade-appropriate assignments, quality instruction, deep engagement, and high expectations from teachers. A growing body of evidence suggests that active teaching improves student learning outcomes, student engagement, and student attitudes. Thus, this project aims to prepare STEM teachers who can teach STEM topics in equitable, rigorous, and active ways. The project design is expected to help preservice teachers: (i) develop greater confidence in their abilities to teach college preparatory STEM courses in engaging and active ways; (ii) gain the necessary content knowledge for teaching physics, chemistry, mathematics or computer science; and (iii) learn how to implement innovative strategies for teaching diverse populations of students in culturally responsive ways. Preservice teachers in the project will be supported during their first year of teaching via seminars and ongoing mentorship.  It is expected that these activities will help the new teachers overcome challenges and continue to improve their instruction. The anticipated outcome of this project is to prepare at least 24 highly qualified secondary STEM teachers who will teach in high-need school districts throughout the Midwest, thus partially addressing critical teacher shortages. Over time, this project has the potential to improve secondary student learning outcomes by addressing factors that contribute to learning opportunity gaps in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project at Drake University includes partnerships with Des Moines Public Schools. The project will prepare, support, and graduate at least 24 new physics, mathematics, chemistry, and computer science teachers by embedding innovative, active learning teaching experiences within their teacher preparation program and associated field-experiences in Des Moines Public School district. The project's preservice teachers will include both undergraduate STEM majors and STEM professionals with a STEM baccalaureate degree. The preservice teachers will complete a coherent three-semester sequence of active teaching experiences across a variety of settings within their preparation programs. Throughout this progression, the project will assess changes in preservice teachers' pedagogical content knowledge and confidence levels for teaching. By prioritizing the critical role that specialized content knowledge plays in supporting active teaching strategies, this project seeks to understand how self-efficacy, pedagogical content knowledge, and teaching effectiveness improve through experiences designed to target and grow new teachers? knowledge using established quantitative and qualitative data collections tools (e.g., STEBI; CoRe; RTOP). This project has the potential to provide insight about the relationship between pedagogical content knowledge and teaching effectiveness and how pedagogical content knowledge develops over time. The project aims to use project activities to increase the level of active learning in secondary and undergraduate STEM classrooms, as well as, the engagement of underrepresented students in these STEM classrooms. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

In particular, the rapid growth of manufacturing amplifies the need to prepare more welding technicians to meet industry demand. This project will expand the use of welding training systems to provide students with real-time feedback during training sessions. The welding trainer and virtual tracking system will capture and evaluate each action a welder makes to complete an assignment and will create a success score for the activity. The project will use this assessment to provide students with credit for existing skills, to create a student portfolio for employment, and to train incumbent employees or develop customized training profiles for specific workplaces.  This assessment-driven approach is expected to contribute to the development of standardized welding practices.  By engaging with precollege students interested in welding pathways and employer partners interested in providing students with experiential learning opportunities, the project also expects to strengthen partnerships with industry and high schools.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create a standardized welding pathway that can be scaled to other institutions and partnerships.

Students? actions during welding exercises will be captured using a welding trainer and virtual tracking system. The baseline model will be used to evaluate and automatically generate a formative assessment of student performance. The project will provide professional development opportunities for K-12 and community college instructors and will partner with Weld-Ed at Lorain Community College for additional professional development.

Plants however, are subject to ambient temperature conditions which can be detrimental to their reproductive success. This investigation will test whether high elevation populations of a wild perennial plant in the southern Colorado Rockies are locally adapted to cool temperatures, with mechanisms that increase flower temperature, whereas low elevation populations have adaptive mechanisms to lower flower temperatures under high ambient temperatures. The work will pinpoint the mechanisms by which flowers warm and cool their internal floral temperatures and test how variation in thermoregulatory ability impacts plant reproductive fitness and plant-pollinator interactions. This award will involve undergraduates at Clemson University in research in STEM fields through studies on how floral warming in local, charismatic spring ephemeral flowers impacts reproductive performance and pollination at the South Carolina Botanical Garden. As climates are changing globally and flowers continue to emerge earlier, this research will inform how plants will ameliorate thermal stress to maintain reproductive success. This work has important implications for the future of plant reproduction in both wild and economically important crop species. <br/> <br/>Angiosperms have evolved various mechanisms to achieve floral temperatures that deviate from ambient conditions, ameliorating damage to pollen and ovules and promoting pollinator visitation. Research to date is biased towards examining mechanisms of floral warming in cold environments, limiting the understanding of local adaptation in floral thermoregulation across thermal gradients and providing few examples of floral cooling. Additionally, studies linking variation in thermoregulation with variation in both gamete viability and pollinator-attraction in field conditions are scarce. This study will first test for differences in floral thermoregulation between high and low elevation populations of a widespread perennial distributed across a large altitudinal gradient in the Southern Rocky Mountains. Using growth-chamber experiments, thermal performance curves for pollen and ovule performance will be generated, and mechanisms of floral warming and cooling will be pinpointed using a combination of time-lapse photography and reflectance spectrometry. Finally, geographic variation in selection on thermoregulatory ability will be determined by linking pollen viability, seed set, and pollinator visitation with variation in floral temperature in both high and low elevation populations. This work will elucidate the complex mechanisms of floral thermoregulation and the impacts of thermoregulatory ability on plant fitness. It will shed light on how flowering plants may cope with changing temperatures and advancing phenologies in changing climates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project supports the collaborative research efforts of UA and BUT faculty focused on fractional-order circuits and systems.  ?Circuits and systems? refers to the field encompassing all design, analysis, and implementation efforts related to electrical circuits. Electrical circuits are the foundation upon which all smart devices, wireless communications, automotive systems, power systems, and healthcare devices are built.  Advancing circuits and systems in each of these fields requires highly qualified engineers who can not only design and implement circuits and systems, but who can creatively import concepts from new fields to overcome challenges not yet even imagined.  Fractional-order circuits and systems is an emerging field expanding the boundaries of realizable electrical circuits; changing how circuits are designed and implemented.  Applications of fractional-order systems range from the control of industrial machines with lower control effort and lower energy costs to modelling the electrical impedance of skeletal muscle to track changes in tissue properties to monitor for injury and disorder. However, advances in the design and practical implementation of fractional-order circuits and systems are needed before they can be quickly and efficiently adopted into control systems and biomedical signal processing circuits. The need for further research into this field was recognized by many universities in the European Union (EU), who launched the COST Action CA15225, ?Fractional-Order Systems: Analysis, Synthesis and their importance for Future Design? to coordinate research efforts; with collaborators from 23 EU countries, 2 near-neighbor countries, and 3 international partner countries. This IRES site supports advancing the COST Action by providing US students with research experiences focused on the design, simulation and characterization of fractional-order circuits, systems, and devices under the mentorships of faculty at BUT, who are leading efforts with the COST Action.  Six U.S. students each year participate in a one-semester course prior to their international experience to prepare them for their 12-week research under the mentorship BUT faculty in Brno. The specific challenges addressed by student projects include i) how to design and simulate fractional-order circuits for the electronic filtering of signals, ii) methods to improve the emulation and fabrication of fractional-order devices, and iii) alternative methods to characterize fractional-order material properties.  Beyond technical skill development, this international research introduces students to the administrative and technical challenges of coordinating and executing a large international collaborative research effort. <br/><br/>This program has several broader impacts that include: i) increasing the number of students from under-represented groups in STEM participating in research; ii) strengthening the international collaborative research network between researchers in the US and the Czech Republic; iii) increasing students intercultural maturity through interactions with international students/faculty and participation in Czech social & cultural activities; and iv) increasing student understanding of graduate studies to increase student pursuit of STEM graduate degrees.  These impacts all support the program focus to develop a diverse, globally-engaged workforce with world-class skills.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many processes that drive these neighborly interactions and they are related to each other in confusing ways. This award will support a series of workshops with the goal helping scientists understand one particularly important process that maintains plant diversity. When plants of the same type grow too close together, many of them die from shared disease or intense competition. Those deaths create opportunities for plants of different types to move in, enhancing diversity. In short, this process prevents one species from growing everywhere and taking over everything. Although this may seem like common sense, scientists disagree a lot about how to measure it and what it really means for diversity. This award will bring many of those scientists together to figure out a path forward. Scientists from many types of institutions and career stages will be invited, including from primarily undergraduate institutions, early career researchers and members of underrepresented groups. All participants will be given opportunities to contribute to products resulting from the workshops, which will have important implications for predicting how plants will respond to environmental stresses. <br/><br/>This series of workshops has two main objectives. First, organizers will bring together top researchers to develop robust approaches that use cutting-edge modeling techniques to assess whether local interactions among plants ? specifically, conspecific negative density-dependence -- contribute to plant species diversity. The approaches that emerge from these meetings will likely become standardized methodologies, providing a much-needed common currency to evaluate ecological influences on the maintenance of plant species diversity. Second, organizers will apply these newly developed approaches to long-term data on plant survival and growth from sites around the world. These analyses will test how diversity-maintaining interactions among plants change across climatic gradients and among different plant species as a function of their traits. Synthesized examination of these basic questions is the first step to transformational insights and further experimental studies into the importance of local interactions among plants in determining regional and global patterns of plant species diversity. To ensure these goals, multiple perspectives are essential.

One of the most cost-effective means of suppressing undesirable wind-induced vibrations of tall buildings is to incorporate auxiliary damping systems.  State-of-the-art assessment and design of such damping systems rely on the use of simplified small-scale damper models in wind tunnel tests. This approach presents limitations in reproducing the complex behaviors of full-scale damping systems in a realistic wind environment, as it can introduce errors and significant uncertainty in tall building response evaluation.

The NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind facility at Florida International University will be used for the experimental validation and demonstration studies. The research program will be complemented with an education and outreach program through curriculum development, hands-on experiences for high school students, and training demonstrations on dynamic testing and wind-induced response reduction for tall buildings.

Multi-messenger gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy has already shown itself capable of answering fundamental questions about the synthesis of heavy elements and the expansion rate of the Universe. New methods developed here will study the non-astrophysical noise sources, including earthquakes and Earth-wide magnetic fields, and remove those effects from the data. It will also make it possible to detect more neutron star and black hole mergers, in addition to GWs from other astrophysical sources such as exploding stars or the emission from a newly-born neutron star. This work will capitalize on the excitement of GW astronomy to build a new outreach program with a focus on GWs to Minneapolis and St. Paul. The group will use these activities to help students understand what LIGO is and how it detects GW signals in order to make this field accessible and available to a new generation of young scientists.<br/><br/>Multi-messenger gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy has arrived with the detection of the merger of compact binary systems. With Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo pushing towards design sensitivity, continued and new efforts to characterize the detectors and subtract known physical effects from the data is required. This work enables the possibility of detecting more compact binaries, as well as discoveries of GWs from other astrophysical sources. Along with the ongoing advances in instrumentation, the realization of GW astronomy depends critically on continued advances in data analysis capabilities. With the goal of significantly increasing the science reach of the advanced detectors, this project will develop techniques and lead searches with new observing run data. The improved search for long-duration burst GWs from compact binary mergers and other sources will increase our sensitivity to signals belonging to an astrophysically important sector of parameter space. Work on the identification and characterization of the seismic environments will increase the available observing time for the observatories, maximizing both their sensitivity and uptime. The new techniques for subtraction of non-linear signals illuminate all of the information that is possible to extract from the interferometer data, supporting understanding of the detector and increasing sensitivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to use the combination of a quantum mechanical treatment of the energy and forces with classical mechanical equations of motion to discover new reaction pathways and mechanisms for organometallic reactions.  Quantum mechanics deals with the mathematical description of the motion and interaction of subatomic particles, incorporating the concepts of quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, and the uncertainty of how fast a tiny particle moves and how well we know its position. Classical mechanical describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies. This project combines the use of equations of physics, at both the atomic and macroscopic scales.  The research project is a fruitful training ground to prepare undergraduate and graduate students for the scientific workforce.  Undergraduate students will learn computational techniques that will be valuable in their future experimental careers. In addition to mentoring physical science students, this work provide cross disciplinary training in computer science.<br/><br/>This work uses quasiclassical direct molecular dynamics trajectories to discover new dynamical organometallic reaction mechanisms, and examine major concepts that provide understanding and prediction of dynamical mechanisms.

This research is aimed at advancing two specific types of energy conversion technologies based on quantum dots (small semiconductor crystals). The first technology is photon upconversion.  This process refers to converting two low energy packets of light (photons) into a higher energy photon, such as converting invisible infrared light to visible light.   The second technology is the use of nanocrystals made from a specific category of materials called perovskites often used in solar cells. Unlike traditional solar cells, perovskite nanocrystals offer the possibility of tuning or adjusting the solar cell properties. This research may provide important guidance on the design and improvement of the energy conversion devices.  Educational and broaden participation activities include the development of a new course on renewable energy and a demonstration module for the Atlanta Science Fair. <br/><br/>With this award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program, Professor Lian? group carries out the research with three specific aims.  The first aim is to test the theoretical models of triplet energy transfer from quantum dots to molecular acceptors by examining its dependence on the electronic coupling strength and driving force using lead halide perovskite and cadmium chalcogenide quantum dots of different size and shell thickness.  The second aim is to investigate the effect of exciton fine structure on triplet energy transfer rates from nanocrystals to molecular acceptors by examining their temperature dependence and to control these rates by changing the exciton fine structure through nanocrystal shapes.  The third aim is to study the property of polarons (formation mechanism, size and energy) in low dimensional lead halide perovskite crystals, examining their dependences on the size, nanocrystal dimensionality, cations and solvent/ligand environment. The findings of this study can advance the understanding of triplet energy transfer from quantum dots to molecular acceptors and polaron formation in low dimensional perovskite nanocrystals. These advances, in turn, provide important guidance on the design and improvement of the energy conversion devices that are based on the abovementioned materials and processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neuroinflammation is responsible for clearing of pathogens and supporting neuron health. However, when neuroinflammation goes out-of-control they can contribute to permanent or progressive cognitive loss in brain injury, Alzheimer?s disease, and many other neurological conditions. Treatment of these diverse diseases would benefit from better understanding of how to regain control of healthy neuroinflammation. Importantly, healthy neuroinflammation is a dynamic process that requires first a pro- followed by an anti-inflammatory response. However, there has been limited investigation to identify the dynamics of healthy neuroinflammation or to determine how to control brain immune cells to restore healthy function. The focus of this CAREER project is microglia, which are the main immune cells of the brain that dynamically respond to pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli.  Their behavior will be explained using quantitative engineering models similar to those used in the design of autopilots. This novel engineering approach will provide new fundamental knowledge on the dynamics of brain immune cells and the relationship between these dynamics and their function to clear pathogens. Moreover, it will enable design of treatments that will promote healthy brain immune function. The Investigator will integrate these research activities with a strong educational outreach program to teach underprivileged elementary school students about the immune system. Planned activities include developing a summer camp on engineering and biological science that includes reinforcement though generation of materials that can be used through-out the school-year and rigorous assessment of student grades and interest in engineering and science.  The Investigator's goal is to open the minds of these students to thinking and working as both engineers and scientists and to foster their interest and aspirations to working in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The Investigator?s long-term career goal is to create and use engineering methods to elucidate mechanisms driving brain immune function and to actively regulate these mechanisms to reduce immune-based injury and promote brain health.  Toward this goal, this CAREER project is to develop a novel paradigm to quantitatively understand the immune cell response to exogenous stimuli and to use this understanding to implement a control system for active regulation of microglia (ARM).  The project will create ARM controllers that will regulate multiple markers of diverse microglial states that will be applicable both in vivo and in vitro and will identify quantitative models of microglial cell state dynamics in response to multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory inputs.  The research plan is organized under three objectives.   The FIRST Objective is to use top-down data driven modeling from control systems engineering to quantify the dynamics of microglial activation in response to biochemical stimuli and use these models to design open-loop control strategies for temporally regulating microglial response in vitro. This will be accomplished through employing flow cytometry to quantify microglial marker dynamics using protein markers known to indicate homeostatic, anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory states; identifying a data-driven dynamic system model for each marker; using results obtained to determine the appropriate system input in terms of an optimal control function; and then validating the system by determining whether or not temporal regulation of primary murine microglia response will modify uptake of Amyloid beta, a key pathogen in Alzheimer?s Disease. The SECOND Objective is to determine if quantitative models can be used as part of a real-time feedback strategy to reduce error between desired and actual trajectory of microglial activation.  This will be accomplished by establishing a microfluidic cell culture platform to enable real-time feedback control of microglial activation markers; enabling real-time monitoring of microglial activation state via microglial transduction with fluorescent reporters for each of the markers studied in the first objective; and then determining, by placing the microfluidic system and transduced reporter microglia in a live-cell imaging system, if the feed-back control ?autopilot? system is capable of regulating a population of microglia to a desired set-point or trajectory.  The THIRD Objective is to determine if control systems modeling can be used to model and design open-loop immune trajectories in mice.  This will be accomplished by identifying a data-driven model for microglial markers in vivo and combining these dynamic models to predict open-loop input strategies using the same modeling framework as used in the first and second objectives; and then testing if modulation of microglial activity will reduce Amyloid beta pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer?s disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In observing that a passenger car takes much space on a roadway due to the relatively long gap following a preceding vehicle, this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project explores emerging modular autonomous vehicle (MAV) technology that can dynamically adjust gaps between vehicles. With the MAV technology, vehicles composed of multiple modular pods can be dynamically docked and separated during operations. For example, during peak hours, modular pods will be docked into longer MAVs, resulting in zero gaps between the modular pods docked together, which obviously improves highway throughput and reduces congestion. Whereas during off-peak hours, a long MAV may separate into shorter MAVs to ensure flexible system accessibility and reduce vehicle operation costs. This way, the MAV service equivalently creates ?elastic? capacity for fixed transportation infrastructure to adapt spatiotemporally-varying travel demand. This project is for a new transmodal MAV system paradigm to realize such elastic capacity of a road transportation system. <br/><br/>To realize this vision, we will adapt multidisciplinary theoretical methods (e.g., time-geography, queuing theory, traffic flow theory, and homogeneous analysis) to understand and formulate operations of an MAV system. Then we will build mathematical models for the optimal design and operations of an MAV system at various scales by synchronizing demands and modular pods over time and space. The major challenge is to deal with continuous time and space as opposed to traditional fleet management problems with discrete time-space states. This challenge will be overcome by integrating microscopic trajectory control into macroscopic fleet management. If successful, this project will provide transmodal concepts to improve transportation and other related systems that are currently segregated into different modes. It will help boost the MAV service from a startup stage to a sustainable industry. The results will help transportation stakeholders understand feasibility and benefits of the MAV service and devise measures to incorporate it in their future planning, which may result in profound positive impacts on surface transportation including transit and freight operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this theory, symmetries are represented by linear transformations of this space, or, more explicitly, by matrices. Thus, a representation of a given symmetry structure is basically a collection of matrices which satisfy a certain natural system of nonlinear equations. The equations are determined by the exact type of symmetry structure we are representing - a group, a Lie algebra, or an associative algebra. Representations of a given structure themselves form a quite intricate and rich structure, which encodes relations (or mappings) between different representations. This higher-level structure is called the category of representations. For some type of structures (e.g. for groups, Lie algebras, quantum groups), representations can be multiplied; in this case the corresponding categories are tensor categories (as multiplication of representations is similar to multiplication of tensors). It turns out that the notion of a tensor category is very interesting in its own right, and that many tensor categories don't arise as categories of representations. The PI will investigate ordinary and tensor categories, some of which arise as representation categories and some of which don't, as well as the connections between them. In particular, complex rank generalizations of representation categories proposed by P. Deligne will be investigated. Roughly speaking, this is a generalization in which the number of elements of a set or rows of a matrix is allowed to be non-integer. This seemingly nonsensical setting becomes meaningful and useful when the invariants one is interested in turn out to be polynomials of the number of elements or rows, which is often true. The PI will also investigate quantizations of singular symplectic varieties, for instance symplectic resolutions. These are non-commutative algebras that appear in certain kinds of quantum field theories of recent interest as algebras of quantum observables. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>This project involves research on: tensor categories; quantum groups; representation theory in complex rank; cherednik algebras; short star-products on quantizations; analytic approach to Geometric Langlands program. The plan of PI's work is as follows. 1. Develop a theory of Frobenius functors for symmetric tensor categories in characteristic p and Frobenius exact <br/>categories; classify exact factorizations of fusion categories, in particular twisted Deligne products; classify fiber functors and module categories over the representation category of the small quantum group; compute the semisimplification of the category of tilting modules for a reductive group in small characteristic, and use it to compute the dimensions of tilting modules modulo p; prove quasi-motivicity of representations of braid groups arising from braided fusion categories; construct new symmetric tensor categories in characteristic p>2 similar to the Etingof-Benson categories in characteristic 2; compute cohomology of these categories; develop Lie theory in the Verlinde category; develop a theory of symplectic reflection fusion categories; continue to develop the theory of actions of finite dimensional Hopf algebras on division algebras (in particular, fields); classify unipotent tensor categories. Work on a discrete analog of the monodromy theorem of Toledano Laredo for the Casimir connection, using dynamical Weyl groups, Study signatures of representations of quantum groups for |q|=1. 2. Continue to develop the ideas of P. Deligne, and extend representation theories of various classical structures (containing the symmetric group S_n or classical Lie groups GL(n),O(n),Sp(2n)) to complex values of the rank parameter n. These structures will include degenerate affine Hecke algebras, rational and trigonometric Cherednik algebras, symplectic reflection algebras, real reductive Lie groups (i.e., symmetric pairs), Lie superalgebras, affine Lie algebras, (parabolic) category O for reductive Lie algebras, Yangians, and other structures. Compute reducibility loci and obtain various character formulas and signature formulas in these representation theories, and answer various other representation theoretic questions which are known to be interesting in the classical setting. 3. Work on the representation theory of double Yangians, the theory of elliptic algebras, representations of cyclotomic Cherednik algebras, signatures of representations of Cherednik algebras, representations of Cherednik algebras in positive characteristic, direct and inverse image functors for Cherednik algebras. 4. Continue to develop the theory of short star-products on filtered quantizations. 5. Continue to work with E. Frenkel and D.

In observing that a passenger car takes much space on a roadway due to the relatively long gap following a preceding vehicle, this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project explores emerging modular autonomous vehicle (MAV) technology that can dynamically adjust gaps between vehicles. With the MAV technology, vehicles composed of multiple modular pods can be dynamically docked and separated during operations. For example, during peak hours, modular pods will be docked into longer MAVs, resulting in zero gaps between the modular pods docked together, which obviously improves highway throughput and reduces congestion. Whereas during off-peak hours, a long MAV may separate into shorter MAVs to ensure flexible system accessibility and reduce vehicle operation costs. This way, the MAV service equivalently creates ?elastic? capacity for fixed transportation infrastructure to adapt spatiotemporally-varying travel demand. This project is for a new transmodal MAV system paradigm to realize such elastic capacity of a road transportation system. <br/><br/>To realize this vision, we will adapt multidisciplinary theoretical methods (e.g., time-geography, queuing theory, traffic flow theory, and homogeneous analysis) to understand and formulate operations of an MAV system. Then we will build mathematical models for the optimal design and operations of an MAV system at various scales by synchronizing demands and modular pods over time and space. The major challenge is to deal with continuous time and space as opposed to traditional fleet management problems with discrete time-space states. This challenge will be overcome by integrating microscopic trajectory control into macroscopic fleet management. If successful, this project will provide transmodal concepts to improve transportation and other related systems that are currently segregated into different modes. It will help boost the MAV service from a startup stage to a sustainable industry. The results will help transportation stakeholders understand feasibility and benefits of the MAV service and devise measures to incorporate it in their future planning, which may result in profound positive impacts on surface transportation including transit and freight operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Kass of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is developing a new strategy for enhancing the activity of organocatalysts. Catalysts are generally metal-containing compounds that accelerate the seed of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation barrier.  Organocatalysts are quite novel because, unlike the great majority of useful metal-based catalysts, they rely only on carbon, hydrogen and a handful of other elements that are not metals.  Organocatalysts are often considered more sustainable than metal-based catalysts because they do not require expensive, toxic, or precious metals.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop new and useful organocatalysts that are environmentally friendly, and to obtain a better understanding of how these species operate. This project lies at the interface of organic, physical, and analytical chemistry, and is particularly well suited for educating and training young scientists. This research will be conducted alongside an NSF-funded Research Experiences for Undergraduate site.  Patents from the research will be explored along with industrial partnerships.<br/><br/>Charge-enhanced acids, bases, and hydrogen bond catalysts will be prepared and characterized. Their catalytic abilities will be examined in a variety of organic transformations, and structural variations will be probed to increase their reactivity and selectivity. For example, what impact does covalent incorporation of the counterion or the use of a chiral counter-anion have on organic transformations? Different chiral platforms will be explored and incorporated into ferrocenium and cobaltocenium ions, in part, to obtain temporal control of the catalyst's acidity.  These species have considerable practical potential, and this research will advance the state of chemical knowledge while also leading to developments that may benefit the environment, human health, and chemical industry.  This research program spans from experiment to theory and from synthetic methodology to physical and analytical measurements. It serves, consequently as an excellent training ground for young scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most cost-effective means of suppressing undesirable wind-induced vibrations of tall buildings is to incorporate auxiliary damping systems.  State-of-the-art assessment and design of such damping systems rely on the use of simplified small-scale damper models in wind tunnel tests. This approach presents limitations in reproducing the complex behaviors of full-scale damping systems in a realistic wind environment, as it can introduce errors and significant uncertainty in tall building response evaluation. This research project will develop experimentation, modeling, and computational capabilities for the design and analysis of such damping systems and to understand how tall buildings perform when integrated with them under realistic wind excitations. The NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind facility at Florida International University will be used for the experimental validation and demonstration studies. The research program will be complemented with an education and outreach program through curriculum development, hands-on experiences for high school students, and training demonstrations on dynamic testing and wind-induced response reduction for tall buildings. As an integrated part of this project, the participation of students from underrepresented groups will be promoted through established institutional programs on high school outreach and undergraduate training activities.

Progress in quantum electronics, from bendable screens of hand-held devices to future quantum information machines, hinges on the development of materials with desirable mechanical and electrical properties. Recent decades have brought remarkable experimental and theoretical discoveries in the physics of materials. Isolation of graphene, a one-atom thick two-dimensional crystal cleaved out of graphite, boosted the discovery of new two-dimensional materials made out of various other elements. Theoretical prediction of topological solids ? conductors, semiconductors, and insulators with highly unusual electronic properties ? have paved the way for the synthesis of these novel materials in the laboratory. Some of them are truly unique by naturally combining the properties of an insulator in the bulk and of a conductor at the surface. The rapid progress in such materials discovery calls for the development of new theoretical methods to understand the properties of these novel materials, explain experimental findings, and help in guiding new experimental discoveries. This project aims at building the theory needed to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>The research addresses a set of electrical conduction and microwave response characteristics of novel low-dimensional topological materials. These characteristics are associated with the materials? unique electronic structure and with the dynamics of their charge carriers. The three specific directions of the research cover the microwave properties of low-dimensional topological superconductors, theory of electron transport in two-dimensional topological solids, and magnetic and electronic characteristics of a class of topological conductors, called Weyl metals. <br/><br/>Graduate students will be actively involved in the research; they will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The PI also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-expert audiences.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research that is focused on theoretical investigations of the dc and ac response functions of several low-dimensional and mesoscopic systems with nontrivial band topology. The emphasis is placed on theory applicable to experiments with superconducting nano-circuits, flat-band two-dimensional conductors, and surfaces of Weyl semimetals. The motivation comes from the advances in synthesis of new materials, experimental techniques enabling the high precision measurements of static and dynamic responses, and from the challenges the evaluation of these responses presents for the theory.<br/><br/>The first part of the project is devoted to developing new methods of studying topological superconducting phases. The main goal of this part is to elucidate the joint effect of disorder and topology of a superconducting phase on the microwave response functions of bulk superconductors and their junctions. The second part of the project aims at developing a hydrodynamic theory of electrons in narrow-band two-dimensional conductors, with or without spontaneously-broken symmetries. The goal is to understand the recently-measured tunneling spectra, predict the electron flow patterns in constrained geometries, and find the corresponding conductance. The third part of the project addresses the magnetic oscillations of the transport and thermodynamic properties associated with a surface of a Weyl metal. The goal is to identify the oscillatory contributions to conductivity and magnetic susceptibility which are associated with a surface, but do not rely on electron trajectories connecting the opposite surfaces.<br/><br/>All parts of the project are geared towards the needs of experimental mesoscopic physics. Solving the problems formulated in the project is expected to explain existing experimental results, help in planning new experiments, and develop theoretical methods broadly applicable to low-dimensional quantum condensed matter. Graduate students will be actively involved in the research; they will be mentored and trained in a broad range of theoretical techniques. The PI also plans to deliver a set of lectures introducing the frontiers of quantum materials theory to non-expert audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such<br/>diseases, including Ebola and COVID-19, significantly affect human health, agriculture and wildlife<br/>conservation. Historically, disease control methods (e.g. vaccination, therapeutics) have focused on<br/>humans or livestock rather than wild animal reservoirs. Focusing on disease control in wildlife could<br/>be more effective in preventing disease emergence in humans, but that approach is currently limited<br/>by three factors. First, many diseases are maintained in cycles that spread across landscapes, but<br/>wildlife diseases are notoriously difficult to assess at these large spatial scales, making responses to<br/>interventions unpredictable. Second, tools like vaccines have been difficult to administer to sufficient<br/>numbers of animals to actually reduce disease transmission in the wild. Third, interventions are<br/>usually bounded by societal constraints, both financial (e.g., limited funds to invest) and sociological<br/>(e.g., conflicting stakeholder interests). New technologies, including vaccines that can spread among<br/>wildlife and miniaturized animal-borne tracking systems, have unrealized potential to overcome these<br/>limitations.

Hooley of the University of California-Riverside is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) and the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Programs of the Division of Chemistry to develop self-assembly approaches to creating new chemical structures that act in a manner similar to enzymes and to explore the potential applications of these structures in catalysis. Large biomolecules such as enzymes (a type of protein) control many cellular processes, and chemists strive to mimic their behavior with artificial analogs, but these mimics cannot approach the complexity of natural enzymes. One approach to create large, complex molecules in a rapid manner is self-assembly, whereby individual pieces are reversibly arranged to make superstructures. This project aims to develop self-assembly approaches to create new chemical structures that act in a manner similar to enzymes and to explore the potential applications of these structures in catalysis. This project provides interdisciplinary research training to a diverse group of graduate and undergraduates students in areas that bridge chemistry, biology and materials science.   In the course of conducting this project, research results are incorporated in the chemistry curriculum and new courses are developed with a focus on promoting diversity and increasing retention of students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Self-assembled cage complexes have a wide array of applications, but their use as biomimetic catalysts is constrained by the lack of activating groups in their ?active site? cavities. This project seeks to remedy this by creating synthetic receptors via metal-ligand based self-assembly that display reactive functional groups to their cavity interiors. This project focuses on three specific areas: 1) creation and host:guest properties of new self-assembled cage complexes with internally oriented acidic, basic and/or ambiphilic groups; 2) application of these cages as enzyme-mimicking catalysts, focusing on novel reactivity patterns that are not accessible with small molecule catalysts such as unusual stereochemistry in oxocarbenium ion cyclizations, and sequential tandem catalysis; 3) creation of robust covalent cage catalysts via post-assembly reaction of the reversible cages and the study of their function in protease-mimicking reactivity. An important objective in this area is to ensure that the cage catalysts are stable to a variety of reaction conditions, and can be applied in multiple different environments, including aqueous solution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To measure adaptation, the researchers will place the bacteria from later generations in competition with the ancestral strain, which has been stored in a deep freeze, and which will be revived for these assays. To quantify genetic change, the researchers will sequence the genomes of bacteria from the evolving populations at different time points and compare them to the ancestor?s DNA sequence. These analyses will provide unique information about the rates, mechanisms, effects, and predictability of bacterial evolution. The knowledge gained will benefit science and society because bacteria are essential to the environment, health, and biotechnology, and because their on-going evolution can impact these vital systems. This long-running study has attracted substantial public interest, and the investigators will continue to communicate their findings with the public as well as with other scientists.  <br/><br/>This long-term research project provides a unique study of bacterial evolution by generating an exceptionally long time-series of samples from 12 replicate populations, all of them founded from the same ancestral strain of E. coli and maintained for decades in identical environments. The research teams will propagate the populations by transferring them daily into fresh medium; every 500 generations, samples will be stored frozen, where they remain viable and available for study. During the next five years, the experiment should surpass 85,000 generations. The frozen samples will be used to analyze the dynamics of adaptation by natural selection, the coupling of phenotypic and genomic evolution, and the repeatability of evolutionary changes. Among the questions to be addressed: Will the fitness of the bacteria relative to their common ancestor continue to increase? Do the trajectories for relative fitness and genomic evolution have similar curvatures, or are they discordant? How repeatable are the fitness gains and genomic changes across the replicate populations? The biological samples and datasets generated in this project will be shared with the scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Properties and mechanisms driving STEVE remain an exciting and unresolved geospace community challenge.  This workshop brings senior and early career scientists together with citizen scientists to share their understandings and plan for future observational and modeling activities to better understand the STEVE phenomenon.<br/><br/>In this workshop, observational and theoretical geospace scientists and stakeholders will gather to disseminate STEVE research findings, identify outstanding questions, and formulate future research plans and collaboratory studies. The workshop will have two general foci: (1) serve as a venue for developing observation strategies, experimental campaigns and associated observation modes to fill in both synoptic and event-based data gaps; (2) organize modeling efforts, guided by known characteristics to date, to answer key community questions about STEVE physical morphology and dynamics. A post-workshop white paper organized by the workshop steering committee will efficiently capture community discussions, results, and future plans for advancing geophysical understanding of STEVE. This document can also form inputs to community science working groups that will help incorporate STEVE knowledge into physical understanding of the geospace system.

Consequently, the number of biotechnology jobs is projected to increase in the region, as well as nationally. Despite the growing workforce demand, the public has a limited understanding of the biotechnology field or its promising career options. In addition, high school students, including students from economically challenged, underrepresented, and/or rural backgrounds, have limited exposure to the range of possible college and career choices. This project aims to increase the number and diversity of biotechnicians entering the workforce. To achieve this goal, the project will engage students and their families in workshops to improve their understanding of biotechnology as a vibrant career and to raise awareness of other educational and career opportunities. The project will target high schools with majority-minority enrollment and/or rural status, thus increasing opportunities to enroll students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM and in college-level biotechnology programs. This project has the potential to provide opportunities for upward socioeconomic mobility for the members of underrepresented communities in STEM by equipping them with the knowledge and skills needed in biotechnology careers. <br/><br/>To address the growing industry demand, the project specific aims include to: (1) develop an associate degree in STEM with a concentration in biotechnology; (2) refresh the curriculum of an existing biotechnology certificate; (3) increase awareness of biotechnology careers and the number and diversity of students completing biotechnology curricula; and (4) provide summer internships for students to develop employability skills in biotechnology. The project includes partnerships with local public-school districts to recruit students into a newly created associate degree in STEM with a concentration in biotechnology. In collaboration with local industry partners, the project will provide summer internships to help students gain professional, field-specific, and career-readiness skills. The project expects to increase and diversify the biotechnology workforce by engaging high school students and their families in community-based outreach events that use hands-on biotechnology activities. Academic and career information, including degree programs, job descriptions, and salaries, will be disseminated at these events. Additionally, the project will create summer professional development opportunities emphasizing biotechnology for high school teachers and a week-long summer institute on the Harford Community College campus for high school students considering biotechnology as a career option.

This IRES Track I project seeks to develop such solutions while exploring new frontiers of biobased plastics and materials and training the next generation of innovative problem solvers.  Through the proposed program, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students from at Arizona State University (ASU) and Navajo Technical University (NTU) will travel to and participate in hands-on research projects in the Department of Biobased Materials at Kyoto Institute of Technology (KIT) in Kyoto, Japan.  For 10 weeks each Summer, this project will provide training opportunities for 3 graduate and 6 undergraduate student participants; or 9 and 18 total participants, respectively, over the duration of the 3-year project.  Students will be embedded into the labs of KIT faculty, collaborating and working closely with them and their students.  By engaging students in a series of meaningful research experiences, this project seeks to spark and/or further cultivate their interest in biotechnology, materials science, and sustainability, while strengthening their enthusiasm for advanced studies and careers in STEM disciplines.  Through partnership with NTU, along with a conscientious overall recruitment strategy, this project will also provide important STEM research opportunities for students from under-represented groups.  In addition to impactful research experiences, tours of industrial sites and government research facilities will be offered to improve  the professional preparation of students and their understanding of future career opportunities in this field. Student participants will also take part in a series of unique cultural activities.  Ultimately, by offering this project internationally at a university with world-class faculty and research facilities and in a city with unparalleled cultural amenities, this  program will also help to strengthen student identities as members of a global scientific community, while impressing upon them the importance of collaboration for providing solutions to complex global problems.  By enhancing the production of bioplastics, outcomes of this project offer the promise to reduce dependence on non-renewable oil and natural gas as well as, in many cases, the potential to positively impact the carbon cycle by consuming atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas.  <br/><br/>Part 2: <br/>The goals of the specific projects to be offered via this program span the continuum of relevant research challenges facing the production of biobased plastics and materials, including from upstream conversion, to polymer synthesis and materials development, to characterization of the resulting products, to their ultimate biodegradation.  Students in the program will receive comprehensive training in one or more the following areas: i) applied microbiology and bioprocess engineering to enhance the availability of diverse, bio-derived monomers; ii) polymer chemistry and engineering for producing new bioplastics from bio-derived monomers; iii) engineering of novel fibers and materials from diverse sources (e.g., bamboo and silk) and for various applications; iv) synthesis and characterization of novel, functionalized biomaterials for biomedical applications; v) development of new analytical techniques for high-throughput screening of novel monomers and nanostructural characterization of biobased materials and plastics; and vi) investigation of sustainable methods for bioplastic degradation.  This program will also provide numerous opportunities for direct engagement between faculty members across schools, enabling it to serve as an effective platform for fostering long-term, multi-disciplinary research collaborations between institutions.

To draw an analogy with ecology, this change in perspective is akin to the realization that, in order to understand the movement of a single fish in the sea, it helps a great deal to understand how that fish interacts with the other members of their school. In mathematics, the notion of a moduli space loosely refers to an entire family of objects; for example, in the fish analogy, the moduli space could refer to the entire school of fish. Moduli spaces can, themselves, be treated as a single entity, comprised of many, and we can learn about the objects we are interested in by studying the shape of the moduli space that parametrizes them. It can be especially enlightening to understand the shape of moduli spaces near their boundary, and the research supported by this NSF award is driven by the goal of understanding the shape of the boundary of a number of moduli spaces that parametrize different types of families of algebraic curves. This project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The research aspects in this project fall into three interrelated categories, all with the common theme of investigating various compact moduli spaces of curves and what geometric and enumerative information can be gleaned from the structure of their boundary. In the first line of problems, the PI will study new classes of moduli spaces that can be realized as wonderful compactifications associated to certain complex reflection groups. These new moduli spaces provide a fertile testing ground for investigating the extent to which polyhedral methods can be generalized beyond toric varieties. In the second line of problems, the PI will introduce moduli spaces into the study of factorization problems in complex reflection groups. In particular, the primary objective is to study the polynomial structure of factorizations by constructing a suitable compactification of the associated moduli spaces of admissible covers. In the final line of problems, the PI will initiate a study of the tautological rings of the moduli spaces of pseudo-stable curves. These spaces provide alternative compactifications of the moduli spaces of curves that allow for curves with cuspidal singularities, instead of the usual nodal singularities, and progress in this research would lead to advances concerning the enumerative geometry of curves with cuspidal singularities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These nocturnal predators, which inhabit tropical and subtropical habitats on all major landmasses except Antarctica, are important for controlling insect populations and have hardly changed anatomically in 300 million years. What little is known about their life history and behavior reveals complex courtship rituals, male combat, territoriality, sociality, parental care, and chemical defense with an arsenal of noxious defense secretions. Despite the deep evolutionary timescale, global distribution, ecological importance, and fascinating life history and behavior of Pedipalpi, little progress on their classification has been made in a century, and their branch of the Tree of Life is barely assembled, hindering the testing of hypotheses concerning their evolution. By leveraging technological advances in genomics, microscopy, imaging, and informatics, and integrating anatomical and genomic data, this project will build the first comprehensive tree of life for living and fossil Pedipalpi, train a new generation of experts on these poorly studied arachnids, and disseminate results to the public. Two Ph.D. students and two postdoctoral associates, from groups under-represented in science, will be supported. Each year, an undergraduate, two high school students, and two citizen scientists will be involved in research. Courses on the biology and classification of Pedipalpi, with an introduction to the local fauna, will be presented on four continents. New material, data, and images will enhance scientific infrastructure. Results, data, and educational outreach materials will be disseminated at meetings, online, and via nationally distributed classroom magazines.<br/><br/>The project has four primary aims. (1) Using a high-throughput, targeted enrichment approach, ca. 100,000 base-pairs of DNA sequence, per specimen, will be generated for representatives of all major lineages, 70% of the genera, and 30% of the species of living Pedipalpi. (2) A matrix of morphological observations will be compiled for all species in the genomic dataset and representatives of extinct lineages of Pedipalpi and their chelicerate relatives. The phylogeny and morphology will be used to (3) present a predictive classification of Pedipalpi above the level of genus and conduct monographic taxonomic revisions of four lineages, and (4) investigate questions concerning the evolution and diversification of Pedipalpi. How, when, and where did the major lineages of Pedipalpi diversify, and which key innovations enabled them to do so? Is morphological specialization to life in caves, commonly inhabited by Pedipalpi, an irreversible, evolutionary dead-end? Is sexual dimorphism in the spinose pedipalps (claws) of Amblypygi ancestral or derived, and did it evolve to reduce injury in ritualized male combat, or was it sexually selected?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The past two decades have witnessed compounding problems in observational cosmology that simply don?t go away: the accelerated expansion of the Universe, tension between the local and early Universe epoch measurements of the Hubble constant, and non-detection of dark matter are prime examples of crises in physics.  A multitude of effort is being made to better understand these problems as one does not know where the problem might be.  Modified gravity theories are seen as one possible solution. Likewise, conceptual problems in general relativity need to be examined observationally from a variety of different approaches to be successful. This award will test general relativity in ways complementary to other tests (e.g. the black hole no-hair test) and probe the strong-field regime of gravity, making the full use of the signal. These tests will either detect violation of general relativity or constrain certain modified theories of gravity that have been invoked to explain the aforementioned cosmological problems.<br/><br/>General Relativity has been a tremendously successful theory in explaining current astronomical observations and laboratory experiments. Nevertheless, there is a general consensus that the theory is at best incomplete, representing an approximation to a more complete theory that cures some or all of its problems. The work supported by this grant is takes a two-pronged approach to explore general relativistic violations: 1.	Measure the multipolar structure of the observed radiation to test for self-consistency of general relativity. 2. An incoherent, time-frequency test that checks for consistency of the observed signal-power in different multipoles with the predictions of general relativity. The tests will improve upon the current approach in two significant ways. Firstly, for binaries with large mass asymmetry (m1/m2>2) and orbital inclinations more than 30 degrees one can expect appreciable signal power in higher order multipoles. Secondly, by making use of the full inspiral-merger-ringdown signal in the analysis increases the signal-to-noise ratio in higher modes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both the home and host institutions perform follow-up observing for NASA?s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TESS is tasked with the Level 1 Science Requirement of discovering and measuring the masses of 50 transiting small planets (less than 4 Earth radii), and it is expected to discover thousands of additional exoplanets in orbit around nearby, bright stars.  The TESS mission relies on a dedicated network of ground-based follow-up observatories to identify false-positive signals, confirm planet radii and masses, and provide other planetary characterization measurements.  The on-campus observatory at Kutztown University (KU) in Pennsylvania conducts such work as an active member of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP) Working Group (WG).   KU?s observatory is an on-campus educational research facility capable of detecting and measuring the sizes of large Jupiter-like exoplanets (already having co-discovered more than 10 new planets) and clearing smaller TESS planet candidates of false-positive signals.  The foreign partner institution, the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) in Australia, is also an active member of the TFOP WG.  USQ?s MINERVA-Australis observatory is a new world-class facility in a dark-sky location that provides TESS with some of the most accurate measurements of the masses of small planets. This project is designed to promote the progress of science by training the participating undergraduate students at KU, and then engaging them in 10-week research experiences at USQ.  Furthermore, this activity will impact (1) national and international interests in exploration by increasing the number of known worlds beyond Earth, (2) the field of astrophysics by studying and characterizing these worlds, (3) scientific literacy by communicating these discoveries to the public and developing inquiry-based activities for local school students, (4) the economy by producing US citizens who are both globally engaged and more rigorously prepared for advanced study, research, and employment in physics- and space-related industries, (5) civil equality by making efforts to recruit qualified female and minority students (both underrepresented in the physical sciences), and (6) international relations by cultivating individual human connections between the citizens of multiple nations.<br/><br/>Part 2:<br/>This project employs two basic astronomical observing techniques; photometry and spectroscopy.  High-precision, seeing-limited photometry enables the measurement of an exoplanet?s size (radius) by detecting the small decrease in apparent brightness of the host star as the planet transits in front of it.  Photometry is also a powerful tool for eliminating false-positives by detecting other nearby variable stars, such as eclipsing binaries (two stars orbiting each other), which are often culprits of these false-positive signals in the TESS data.  The TESS field-of-view is very wide and therefore the light from multiple stars blends together, while the follow-up telescopes are much larger with narrower fields, permitting the direct measurement of individual stars? brightness variations.  High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy detects stellar radial velocity variations to measure the mass of an exoplanet, as the planet?s gravitational interaction with the host star causes the star to orbit (?wobble?) around the star-planet system?s center of mass.  This project will contribute many valuable photometric observations and analyses during the participants? training at KU, with high-precision radial velocity work being done during their involvement at USQ, thereby assisting the broader TESS mission in achieving its goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing methods comprise such processes as welding, plating and surface reconstruction, as well as 3-D printing.  Remanufacturing has emerged as a critical element for realizing a sustainable manufacturing industry in the past decade. Recent progress in additive manufacturing (AM) provides enhanced capabilities for remanufacturing that cannot be achieved with traditional manufacturing processes. However, remanufacturing with AM (RwAM) is accompanied by challenges to ensure that supply chains supporting RwAM operate effectively and economically. Current RwAM practices mainly concern end-of-life products, many of which are no longer remanufacturable due to severe damage. Large uncertainties in environmental impacts are often ignored when determining whether it is worth remanufacturing, resulting in the robustness of the decisions in question. This project will investigate methods to support proactive maintenance to avoid catastrophic, end-of-life failures.  Educational opportunities for students, including outreach to underrepresented minorities, are supported by the award.  <br/><br/>This award aims to improve the environmental and economic sustainability of RwAM by innovative proactive remanufacturing and resource-sharing. Three specific objectives are pursued: (1) assess and predict the damage condition of a post-RwAM product through data-driven and physics-based models to capture the inherent latent damage process evolution; (2) develop a distributionally-robust proactive RwAM decision framework to hedge against large uncertainties in environmental impacts; (3) create a novel RwAM resource-sharing system based on two-sided matching models to match the unused RwAM resources with demand and examine the impact of flexibility in the RwAM resource-sharing system.  Successful development of these models will lead to fundamentally new perspectives on RwAM and accelerate its expansion.

This award supports computational research and education on the motion of electrons in quantum materials.  Several recently-discovered materials exhibit the potential to store quantum information in individual electrons that may hold the key to the next generation of quantum computers and quantum communication.  Realizing the full potential of these materials requires precise understanding of how long quantum information can be stored in electron spins and how it disappears eventually by interacting with the vibrations of atoms in the material.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop a computational methodology to simulate quantum electron motion on large supercomputers.  They will use this technique to predict how electron spin changes over times ranging from femtoseconds to microseconds in several promising materials, such as lead halide perovskites, containing heavy atoms that couple spin to the movement of electrons.  Electrons in transition-metal dichalcogenides, another alternative for storing quantum information, can be found in multiple so-called ""valleys;"" the investigators will also study how electron valley and electron spin couple.  For each of these materials, they will simulate the interaction of these quantum states with extremely short laser pulses to interpret experimental measurements of spin and valley dynamics.<br/><br/>This award will also support the team's effort in increasing participation and representation of women in STEM disciplines, especially in the physical sciences. By integrating simulations into intuitive visualizations using augmented reality, they will make electron dynamics understandable to undergraduate and high school students. Finally, this project will strengthen the research infrastructure at UCSC, a Hispanic Serving Institution.<br/><br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to predict quantitatively quantum dynamics of electrons with spin, valley, or other internal degrees of freedom, entirely from first principles. The research team will develop a novel computational methodology and associated massively-parallel open-source software rapidly to evolve density matrices of quantum materials in a Lindbladian formulation, with ab initio treatment of electron-electron, electron-phonon, and electron-photon interactions. This will facilitate calculation of both coherent dynamics and dephasing of spin or valley polarization, along with their experimental signatures in ultrafast spectroscopy. Using this technique, they will investigate spin dynamics in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling and Rashba splitting such as lead halide perovskites and ferroelectric oxides, and valley dynamics in layered transition metal dichalcogenides. This fundamentally new predictive capability will facilitate quantitative analysis of ultrafast optical and free-electron laser measurements with linear and circular polarization, and accurate predictions of spin relaxation of quantum materials. This will be critical for the design and discovery of new material platforms for spintronics, valleytronics and quantum information.<br/><br/>The proposed work will arm the materials research community with first-principles quantum dynamics methods in open-source software. These will include a hierarchy of methods that keep track of different levels of coherence, with corresponding computational requirements ranging from a small computer cluster to future exascale supercomputers. It will thereby deliver a key computational technique necessary for predicting coherent and incoherent ultrafast dynamics in quantum materials, extending significantly beyond the capabilities of existing first-principles methods. The work funded in this project responds directly to one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas, the Quantum Leap, by facilitating quantitative simulation of spin relaxation and carrier dynamics critical for quantum information science. The educational activities associated with this project aim to increase participation and representation of women in STEM disciplines, especially in the physical sciences.

AVs are expected to tremendously enhance the efficiency, safety and convenience of existing transportation systems. However, all these benefits hinge on the level of market penetration of AVs being sufficiently high. At low market shares, AVs exert little impact on enhancing transportation system efficiency. Worse yet, early deployment of AVs may even compromise the efficiency. The transition period is expected to be lengthy. If we can shorten it, the tremendous benefits promised by AVs can be realized sooner. This grant thus sets out to investigate incentivizing policies and innovative traffic management strategies to promote the development and deployment of AVs to maximize the social benefit over the entire duration of the AV deployment. Specifically, incentivizing policies will nurture the AV market and accelerate their adoption while innovative traffic management schemes aim to better utilize AVs in the traffic stream and promote high-occupancy mobility services to maximize the benefits of AVs at a given market share. The synergies between incentivizing policies and traffic management schemes may create an upward spiral for the AV deployment and particularly reduce the duration of initial deployment where AVs exert little or even negative impact on enhancing efficiency. This grant will provide timely support for government agencies to better understand the impacts and implications of AVs and provides guidance on their development and deployment. This grant will involve students at all levels and traditionally underrepresented students, and offer fresh materials and case studies for courses on emerging automated mobility. Research results will be broadly disseminated through a variety of media.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted in two main thrusts. The first is the study of policies like tax credits, subsidies, and preferential treatments for AVs etc., which can incentivize the deployment of AVs from lower to higher penetration rates to maximize the benefits of AV deployment throughout a planning horizon. As part of the first thrust, we plan a continuous time principal-agent framework in which the government is the principal who offers an incentive policy, and the manufacturer is the agent who sets the retail prices of AVs. The optimal incentive mechanism is obtained by considering the interplay between these two entities. In the second thrust, we will develop innovative schemes to improve the social welfare of the transportation system. These schemes could involve headway-based congestion pricing for penalizing excessive headways of prototype AVs or occupancy-based pricing for promoting high occupancy mobility. In parallel, a distributed control scheme will be developed to use AVs in the traffic stream as control actuators to distribute traffic demand across the transportation network to reduce congestion. As the impacts of incentivizing policies from Thrust 1 and traffic management strategies from Thrust 2 are intertwined, an iterative application of the models developed in both thrusts can prescribe a wise course of actions to evolve and manage automated mobility. If successful, this grant makes three critical contributions: a continuous time principal-agent approach for incentive policy analysis, data-driven headway- or occupancy-based congestion pricing and distributed control of AVs for managing traffic flow. Specifically, we formulate the incentivizing policy design as a non-zero dynamic Stackelberg game under asymmetric information, a class of problems extremely difficult to solve using traditional techniques. We offer an innovative framework to decouple the decision-making processes to make the problem mathematically tractable. Our research also advances the theory of congestion pricing by providing a new framework of designing fine-grained pricing schemes based on vehicle trajectory and occupancy. It shifts the paradigm from model-based pricing to be more data-driven. The distributed control of AVs for managing network traffic flow enriches the traffic control literature and theorizes participatory traffic control that is distributed, scalable and effective.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research seeks to design, synthesize, and study inorganic, organic, and bioorganic materials for next-generation functional molecular electronics. Organic and bioorganic materials present a versatile and unique opportunity for exploring new concepts in electronics, spintronics, and related technologies. The research is relevant to solar energy generation, storage, organic field-effect transistors, and even biomedical applications. Students will receive enhanced professional training and exposure to world-class researchers and facilities, in addition to experiencing international-level teamwork and post-research activities, including networking opportunities. This project will also increase the involvement of underrepresented minority students in undergraduate research through targeted recruiting at Doane and through the NSF-funded the Iowa-Illinois-Nebraska STEM Partnership for Innovation in Research and Education (IINSPIRE) Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP). The inclusion of Alliance students will strengthen existing connections and build networks for further collaboration between students and campuses in the Alliance and could serve as a model for future projects. Participation in research experiences by students from groups underrepresented in the physical sciences increases the likelihood that they will persist in their STEM studies and pursue advanced STEM degrees. This project serves the national interest by (1) promoting the progress of science in critical areas such as energy independence and electronic materials for computing and devices, and (2) increasing the future prosperity and welfare of students entering the STEM workforce by providing high-quality training and professional development, especially for underrepresented individuals and students from small colleges and universities that do not have advanced research capabilities.<br/><br/>The Doane IRES KIT-UBT will provide fifteen U.S. undergraduate students with eight-week research experiences in Germany at KIT and UBT. This project will help accelerate the development of molecular-defined low-dimensional materials which may enable new organic, inorganic, and bioorganic electronics devices, organic logic devices, single-molecule transistors, dipolar logic, and other devices where the electronic properties depend on the behavior and the polarization of single molecules. Developing an accessible technology like inkjet printing for energy creation materials could further the future of energy independence and resilience. IRES KIT-UBT students will (1) receive rigorous training in preparation for research; (2) conduct publishable research in materials for molecular electronics; (3) increase individual cultural competency; and (4) receive enhanced professional development that promotes scientific literacy, college success, and pursuit of STEM careers. Students will be well-prepared to conduct research at KIT and UBT through pre-departure activities, including a semester-long research preparation course that includes language and culture instruction, a week-long site visit at Doane from host faculty, and participation in a research orientation session at Doane. Continued mentoring and professional development after the research experience will be achieved through participation in STEM seminars, local and national STEM conferences to present research results, continued research with mentors at students' home institutions or new research projects, and the publishing of research results. <br/><br/>The organic materials explored in the research projects are expected to be relevant for the development of nanoscale molecular electronics. Students will utilize scanning probe lithography, dip-pen nanolithography, inkjet and slot-die printing, in-situ absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy during spin-coating, self-organizing liquids, and instrumentation to create and investigate properties of nanomaterials such as graphene nanoribbons, ferroelectric organic thin films, and functionalized organic polymer films and functionalized graphene. The outcomes of this research are expected to yield general design principles and new strategies that will guide the development of new materials. Through communication of results and promotion of the program by the students and faculty involved, expanded public knowledge of material development for molecular electronics, STEM research, and the IRES program will result.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By learning from Nature, Biomimicry or bio-inspired engineering innovation has great potential to address such human challenges. The practice of biomimicry requires a diverse group of scientists and engineers equipped with technical knowledge of biomimicry and interdisciplinary, cross-cultural research experience. To meet this need, the BIOFLOW IRES Track-1 site delivers international research experience to US students, operated by Cleveland State University (CSU) and University of Akron (UA) through a long-time partnership with the Biofluid & Biomimic Research Center (BBRC) at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), South Korea. As a Korean government-funded National Creative Research Center, BBRC has excelled at advancing the knowledge of bio-fluid flow physics in Nature and developing bio-inspired engineering solutions. The BIOFLOW IRES project leverages the world-class resources of bio-flow and biomimicry expertise, research facilities, and equipment for a diverse group of 18 US students to conduct creative bio-inspired research, gain solid research and communication skills, and build a professional network. This group of students is well-prepared to embark on their careers as future leading researchers, scientists, and ambassadors for biomimicry research and innovative design. The collaborative IRES project opens up new interdisciplinary research collaboration that bridge biology and engineering, strengthens international research partnerships, and contributes to enhancing the competitiveness of the US workforce in the global economy. <br/><br/><br/>The BIOFLOW IRES project aims to provide future scientists and engineers with a global, cross-cultural perspective, and professional growth opportunities through cutting-edge international research training, structured mentoring, and networking opportunities. Research on bio-fluid flows and biomimicry focuses on two complementary research themes addressing the Grand challenges: enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience of the built environment. The IRES participants perform wind-tunnel tests to evaluate the effectiveness of a seal-whisker-inspired turbine blade for vertical axis wind turbines, explore how the shapes of plant leaves affect energy exchange, and create tree-like flow-control devices to suppress rooftop vortices in high winds. Research discovers new knowledge of working principles of bio-fluid flow phenomena in biology and catalyzes original engineering innovations to achieve enhanced energy efficiency and wind resilience. IRES students gain authentic research training in advanced thermal/flow measurements, critical thinking, and career-building skills benefiting from extraordinary resources at US labs of CSU/UA and the Koerean host lab BBRC. Along with innovative research, the IRES students participate in social and cultural exchange activities to enhance student-faculty, student-mentor, and student-student connection, starting a professional network for future collaboration and career development, an impact beyond the IRES program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, existing proxy climate records will be used to produce new robust and unbiased syntheses of rainfall and sea-surface temperature changes during three different past intervals when the North Atlantic abruptly cooled and compare them against new and existing climate model simulations with the objective of testing the dominant mechanisms driving the tropical response to hemispheric forcing. These mechanisms will be contrasted with the responses to other hemispheric forcings, anthropogenic aerosols and volcanic eruptions, to assess their roles, and therefore improve the confidence of climate variability model predictions. The research has the potential to produce a complete theory of how the global tropics respond to North Atlantic cooling. This theory will provide a more complete understanding of the processes that give rise to inter-hemispheric asymmetries in tropical climate - one of the first order features of the Earth?s climate, as well as its response to climatic perturbations with inter-hemispheric asymmetries, such as anthropogenic aerosols, volcanic eruptions, or arctic sea ice loss. <br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include advancing theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying climate perturbations transmitted through the tropics which has the potential to improve model predictions to a range of climate forcings, and more specifically, predictions of changes in tropical rainfall in heavily populated areas (the Americas, Africa, Asia).

In this research, specific examples of these compounds are targeted for synthesis, and the prepared compounds will be made available to address important biological questions.  The scientific approach employed for these syntheses focuses on the utilization of simpler starting materials to prepare structurally complex, biologically active natural products.  The educational activities undertaken prepare students for careers in STEM through training in an interdisciplinary team employing laboratory automation.

Conventional theories of electron motion in metals and semiconductors usually treat the motion of each electron independently, in an average environment defined by the other electrons. This independent electron picture has been quite successful in many metals and semiconductors. However, in many newly discovered materials, some of significant technological importance, the subtle quantum correlations between the electrons need to be accounted for, even for an understanding of their macroscopic properties. In particular, quantum entanglement leading to ?spooky action at a distance? can be present not only between a pair of electrons, but across long distances and involving large numbers of electrons. A class of materials of particular interest in this research are the cuprate high temperature superconductors, all of which are layered materials containing layers with copper and oxygen atoms arranged in a square lattice. There is accumulating experimental evidence for a ""quantum critical point"" near a mobile electron density where the highest critical temperature for superconductivity is observed. This theoretical research will describe the phase transition in the electron entanglement across this critical point. New methods for describing many particle entanglement have been developed by the PI and others, and also across different fields of physics, including quantum information theory, high energy particle theory, and quantum gravity. These advances will be synthesized in new theoretical frameworks, and subjected to tests by observations on quantum materials.  <br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by supporting the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates in topics at the forefront of theoretical condensed matter physics. Furthermore, the PI will continue to pursue an active program of public lectures, interviews, colloquia, and lectures at schools for advanced graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research which will examine models of quantum criticality involving gauge theories coupled to finite density matter. While much is known about phase transitions of gauge theories coupled to relativistic matter in 2+1 spacetime dimensions, applications to cuprate criticality require finite density fermionic matter which, in the absence of disorder, has a sharp Fermi surface. The PI and his research team have proposed specific gauge theories for cuprate criticality which satisfy numerous phenomenological constraints imposed by observations. In some mathematical contexts, the combination of the gauge structure and the presence of a Fermi surface leads to effective quantum field theories which are bilocal in time. Currently, little is understood about such bilocal theories in 2+1 dimensions, and unraveling this mystery will be an important focus of this research. Previously, bilocal theories have appeared in models with infinite-range interactions, like the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, which have some attractive phenomenological features. Insights gained from the study of SYK models will be applied to the more realistic bilocal field theories appearing in this research. Another focus area of the research will be on the thermal Hall effect: In the most recent experiments, the thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful diagnostic probe of quantum phase transitions associated with changes in entanglement structure. The PI and his team will extend theories of the thermal Hall effect to models of the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. In addition, correlated electron superconductivity in twisted graphene bilayers will be studied, with a focus on the quantum interplay of multiple competing orders and superconductivity.<br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by supporting the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates in topics at the forefront of theoretical condensed matter physics. Furthermore, the PI will continue to pursue an active program of public lectures, interviews, colloquia, and lectures at schools for advanced graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The grant will support research towards understanding the potential for additive manufacturing (AM) in the production of metallic components subject to extreme thermomechanical excitation. Structures in demanding environments where high temperatures and vibratory loads are combined (e.g., sustained hypersonic flight, space re-entry, exhaust-wash structures, breeder blankets in fusion reactors) often experience fatigue which shortens their lifecycle. It is likely that these types of structures will be produced only in small quantities, making it appropriate to consider additive manufacturing for their construction. Successful design, manufacture and service deployment of such components requires an understanding of the component's progression from its virgin state, through shake-down, towards initiation of detectable non-critical damage, and ultimately to failure. To date, this failure evolution process is fairly well understood for traditional subtractive-manufactured metals. However, there is very limited fundamental understanding of the multi-scale material-structure interactions for failure of AM metals. Because of the unique microstructure of AM metals, their complex thermal history during manufacture, and the presence of significant residual stresses, it is hypothesized that their response under extreme thermoacoustic loading will be significantly different from their traditional counterparts, especially in defect-driven processes such as failure. By understanding the details of this failure process in AM metals under extreme thermoacoustic loading, the results of this study will shed light onto how to better tailor the additive manufacturing approach to produce materials and structures most suitable for operating in such adverse environments.<br/><br/>The research will be undertaken jointly by the PI in collaboration with researchers at the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom, focusing on key aspects that link material-level (micro- and mesoscale) response to the structural-level (macroscale) response. Damage accumulation at the microscale for additively-manufactured metals subjected to cyclic loading and global and local thermal gradients will be quantified using high resolution digital image correlation. At a larger length scale, additively-manufactured plates with geometric reinforcement subjected to thermal buckling during thermo-mechanical excitation will be studied using real-time optical and thermal imaging. A key aspect will be to explore the interaction of the complex thermal processing history of AM metals (including any existing residual stresses) with the transient and coupled thermomechanical loading applied. Finally, the project will identify the fundamental rules governing AM for reliable components subject to high-temperature broadband excitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanocarbon materials are increasingly being used in a range of applications, particularly as electrodes in alternative energy generation and storage systems such as Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. It is now generally agreed that the charge storage and transport properties of these materials are highly dependent on the structural features of their molecules and assemblies. The project is poised to advance fundamental knowledge on the chemical and electronic properties of these non-planar molecular nanocarbons. A better understanding of these systems and their multi-electron acquisition and charge transport processes paves the way for their utilization in practical energy devices. Beyond its fundamental importance, a major objective of the project is the enhancement of the educational and research experiences of graduate and undergraduate students at the SUNY Albany to prepare them for future success in a highly competitive workforce environment.  The PI is actively involved in enhancing the infrastructure across the State University of New York (SUNY) campuses to strengthen the research portfolio and to facilitate innovation in nanoscience, sustainability and energy related fields. <br/><br/>The project is carrying out a broad fundamental investigation of stepwise chemical reduction processes and multi-electron storage capacities of a diverse set of novel nanocarbon materials.

The team is developing catalysts to speed up the product formation and notably, the catalysts made by this team are made of earth-abundant iron and sulfur.  Similar iron-sulfur catalysts are found in nature, but they are fragile.  The new catalysts, after being modified with special polymers, are rugged.

One specific project involves changing the structure of the polymer and the way it is attached to the catalyst. This award also provides students with hands-on experience in the areas of catalysis and energy science.  Once engaged in a collaborative project, the students are exposed to a variety of disciplines and technical cultures, which makes them better leaders.

The research promises to contribute to a clean and sustainable energy economy using intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind as the electricity generated from these sources can be directly stored in the two-electron chemical bond of H2.  This same energy can be easily recovered by burning the hydrogen or by converting the energy back to electricity with a fuel cell, both of which cycle the hydrogen back to water. Typically, the most effective materials for converting electricity and water to hydrogen are platinum and other expensive metals that are too rare to employ on a large scale for a broad energy economy. Nature has solved this problem with hydrogenase enzymes, which feature iron sulfides embedded in the structure of the enzyme to efficiently produce hydrogen. With this inspiration from nature, the first-generation system of iron and sulfur embedded in a metallopolymer created by the team at the University of Arizona produces hydrogen 25 times faster than the natural enzyme and approaches platinum in efficiency.

Professor Yarmoff and his students use specialized characterization methods to investigate how the properties of metal nanoparticles are affected by the nature of the support material on which they reside and how defects in the support alter their properties. In particular, they measure the charge on individual atoms within the clusters and observe how the cluster size and number of support defects affect what molecules will or will not stick to the supports.  Nanoparticles are a distinctive class of materials because they have sizes intermediate between molecules (few atoms) and solids (trillions of atoms).  Nanoscale materials exhibit unique chemical and electronic properties that depend on their size, leading to many potential applications that include advanced electronics, battery technologies, solar power generation, environmental remediation, and chemical catalysis.  Understanding, and then learning how to control the properties of nanoscale materials broadly, impacts knowledge in basic science and practical applications.  A diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of California-Riverside, an Hispanic serving institution, are gaining valuable experience by conducting laboratory experiments in a field at the forefront of modern science. In addition, the research results are disseminated via multifaceted in-house and outreach initiatives.  This includes participation in a Summer Physics Teachers Academy, a week-long workshop which includes hands-on laboratory experiences to train local high school teachers and stimulate the interest of their students in STEM careers.  <br/><br/>The edge atoms of supported metal nanoclusters may be the active sites that drive chemical reactions via adsorption of precursor molecules to the cluster atoms that are directly bonded to the substrate. There is also strong evidence that the electronic environment of metal nanoclusters is critical in determining their electronic and chemical behaviors. Supported metal nanoclusters are directly deposited, or produced by buffer layer assisted growth (BLAG), onto oxide, sulfide, fluoride and frozen noble gas substrates. A novel form of low energy ion scattering (LEIS) is used to investigate the charge distribution within metal nanoclusters by measuring the neutralization of scattered low energy alkali ions. This method previously showed that the charge within a gold nanocluster is inhomogeneous, with the edge atoms being positively charged while the center atoms are essentially neutral. This project builds on this knowledge by exploring how the charge distribution depends on the cluster and substrate materials, the number of defects at the cluster/support interface, the subsequent adsorption of electronegative and electropositive adatoms and small molecules, and how defects in the substrate modify adsorption. The research results wicontribute to a fundamental understanding of metal nanoclusters, thereby enabling the tailoring of their properties to improve functionality and practical utility.

Graphene is a highly flexible, two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms and is ideally suited for the coating of large surfaces. This project aims to demonstrate that water flow over graphene surfaces can directly generate electricity. Graphene is ideally suited for this application, since it possesses high-mobility charge carriers that are ready to be coupled to moving ions present in the flowing fluid. Graphene is also flexible, minimally invasive (it is the thinnest material), chemically and mechanically stable, and environmentally benign. Moreover, its synthesis is scalable and macro-scale continuous graphene films can be produced by roll-to-roll deposition techniques. The proposed graphene coating offers unique possibilities for energy harvesting from hitherto untapped renewable sources such as rain, tidal action, waves, ocean currents, river water as well as water flow over boats, submarines, and bridges. Such graphene skins could enable harvesting of the ubiquitous, abundant and renewable mechanical energy of moving water directly to electrical energy. Unlike traditional schemes, the graphene coating directly converts the flow energy into electrical energy without the need for moving parts. Such graphene coatings could also replace conventional batteries (which are environmentally hazardous) in low-power, low-voltage and long service-life applications. Once scaled up, this concept offers a potentially transformative approach to energy harvesting, as compared with incremental advances in current technologies. The investigators will develop specially designed interactive learning modules (or virtual labs) which will be integrated into the curriculum. Outreach includes demonstrations to undergraduates as well as to high school students and teachers. The PIs aim is to popularize science and to attract under-represented groups to pursue careers in renewable energy technologies.        <br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will tackle the fundamental science and engineering challenges associated with developing graphene-based coatings for nano-fluidic power harvesting. The key science challenge involves understanding in-depth the mechanism(s) responsible for nano-fluidic power harvesting in graphene films. In particular, the project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of how ions present in a fluid such as water, interact and couple with graphene-coated as well as free-standing graphene surfaces. This will be addressed using carefully designed control experiments in conjunction with molecular dynamics and first principles density functional theory calculations.     The engineering challenge is equally important and involves scaling up the graphene size in a manner that retains the outstanding power density of the coating. This will be addressed by adapting newly developed roll-to-roll and template-directed chemical vapor deposition techniques to produce macroscale graphene films and foams. The graphene manufacturing process will be optimized to avoid physical interfaces (breaks) in the film as it is scaled up to macroscale dimensions and to tightly control thickness and structure-properties of the graphene. The coupling between experiments and theory, modeling and simulation work will build fundamental understanding of the underlying science and enable successful development, optimization and validation of the proposed technology.

In order to lower the environmental impact of human activities at a national and international scale, there is a need for the development of value-added products from local biomass. It is possible to enhance some properties of biomass through the use of a controlled heat treatment in the absence of oxygen (torrefaction). Torrefaction is a thermal process to convert biomass into a coal-like material, which has better fuel characteristics than the original biomass. Torrefied biomass is more brittle, making grinding easier and less energy intensive. Heat-treated  (torrefied) biomass can be more easily processed, leading to more homogeneous products for energy applications. The goal of this project is to refine a mathematical model describing the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis to more accurately determine the best treatment conditions for different biomass. Such a model will allow manufacturers to tailor heat treatment to specific biomass sources, ensuring optimal properties in the final products and providing control over the reproducibility of those properties. This project will provide US students of a diverse background and limited research and international experience, hands-on training in cutting-edge technical skills while partnering with a world-class laboratory for wood research in France. Its advanced and specialized unique facilities put it at the forefront of technology development worldwide for the heat treatment of ligno-cellulosic materials. The US students? experience will be complemented by professional development activities that will guide them in fine-tuning their communication skills (scientific writing and presentation), making strategic plans for their careers in science, and disseminating the results of their work. Ultimately, participants in this project will gain knowledge and skills necessary for the increased economic growth and technological innovation of the United States of America.  <br/><br/>This IRES (track I) project is a ten-week annual program in which four US students conduct research projects focused on studying biomass torrefaction kinetics in a renowned laboratory at the University of Lorraine, in Epinal, France. After returning to the US, they validate their findings using local biomass at Georgia Southern University. In addition to the research component, the program includes a series of professional development activities that were proven successful by the PI and co-PI in their department?s summer undergraduate research experience program over the past several years. Therefore, this project utilizes an established, solid framework for the assessment, recruitment, and professional development of the participants. The research plan consists of four separate projects tied together by a common goal. The four proposed projects are (1) Refinement of a mathematical model describing pyrolysis of biomass by incorporation of modules associated to mineral content, reaction atmosphere, and nature of ligno-cellulosic biomass (hardwood vs softwood), (2) Data acquisition on the effect of mineral content on torrefaction of biomass, (3) Data acquisition on the effect of reaction atmosphere on torrefaction of biomass, and (4) Data acquisition on the effect of biomass nature (harwood vs softwood) on torrefaction of biomass. The data acquired in projects (2), (3), and (4) will be used in project (1) for refinement and improvement of the mathematical model. Upon continuous revision of the mathematical model over the course of the funding period, a better expression will be obtained, providing further insight about the torrefaction mechanism. Indeed, a mathematical model describing the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis will more accurately determine the best treatment conditions for different biomass, allowing manufacturers to adjust heat treatment to specific biomass sources, further ensuring property optimization in the final products while providing greater control over the process and properties? reproducibility. This can potentially eradicate two of the major impediments to widespread commercial use of biomass, namely (1) inherent variability in the results and (2) the inability to control the outcome. Overall, this project is a combination of cutting-edge research in sustainable energy and training of future U.S. workforce in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalyst are used in academic and industrial chemical laboratories to speed up chemical reactions while selecting for specific products over others.  Single atom catalysts are often made of nanoparticles - a billionth of a meter.  Nanoparticles have unique properties which distinguish them from their bulk counterparts because of their reduced size and confinement. For example, bulk gold is an inert material, but in nanoparticle form it be very reactive with gases in the air (like carbon monoxide). The miniscule size of the nanoparticles also means reduced cost of the precious metal. The last decade has seen much research on nanocatalysts whose local environment can be controlled down to the single atom (usually on a supportive surface). The factors that control reactivity and product selectivity are of particular interest in nanocatalysts. In this project, Professors Rahman, Hong and Liu carry out joint computational and experimental studies of oxidizing (burning in a controlled way) methanol to form carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen on singly-dispersed platinum, copper, and cobalt nanoparticle catalysts. The systematic coupling between theory and experiment helps set guidelines for the rational design of single atom catalysts with desired reactivity and selectivity properties. Professor Rahman leverages her position as the UCF site leader for the American Physical Society Bridge Program to mentor the graduate students from underrepresented minority groups that work on the project. Existing international collaborations help extend the outcomes globally. Undergraduate students at Brewton-Parker College are actively engaged in chemistry research, gaining useful experience for careers in academics or industry. <br/><br/>This project is expected to result in strategies for predicting and controlling the reactivity of atomically dispersed nanocatalysts, as a function of their local atomic environment. Research components include: thermodynamics-assisted, density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations of electronic and geometric structure, vibrational dynamics and entropy, reaction pathways and energetics; and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of reaction rates and turn over frequencies, as a function of ambient temperature and pressure; synthesis of the single atom catalysts.  The research team will use scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to confirm the single site status of targeted systems.  Postdocs and graduate students will conduct an experimental determination of methanol partial oxidation reaction rates and turnover frequencies as well as studies of in situ diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to verify surface reactive intermediates and track reaction mechanisms. Theory and experiment working in tandem provide an understanding of reaction mechanisms and insights into factors such as charge transfer, strain, etc. that control site activity. More importantly, competing reaction pathways (and reaction intermediates) responsible for product selectivity are exposed, thereby providing a design control.

The input modes of many current assistive technologies, however, are limited. They can mostly interface with specific tasks such as computer mouse control, wheelchair driving, or text entry, but not for multiple of these purposes. Even if these technologies interfaces with multiple modalities, they are not very user-friendly, and a disabled individual may choose not to use the inefficient modality or switch from one technology to another for different tasks. One of the most powerful candidates in the human body to interact with assistive technologies is the tongue. The human tongue is able to harness voluntary movements above the neck in individuals with severe disabilities. Existing tongue-based assistive technologies perform cursor navigation and wheelchair driving with the same level of comfort as using a finger, but their performance in text entry is not good. This project will explore how the tongue-based interfaces can improve the performance of text entry (apart from tasks such as navigation and other discrete commands) by developing intuitive and easy-to-learn tongue commands. Ultimately, this multimodality will enhance both the independence of those with limited hand motions (e.g., Tetraplegia, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and age-related neurological disorders) and the quality-of-life of their caregivers.<br/><br/>For text entry, a user should be able to unambiguously specify the position and sequence of keys that should be considered as input. In order to use the human tongue for text entry, the associated algorithm should be able to handle the continuous tongue motion (involving multiple degrees of freedom), identify the movements related to text entry, and detect and ignore ?normal? tongue movements such as swallowing saliva, etc. To address these challenges, this project will model the performance of users on tongue-based commands by the number of commands to be carried out and investigate efficient text entry methods along with various modes/mechanisms of text entry (such as a touchscreen). The research team has developed a new tongue-based assistive technology, Multifunctional intraORal Assistive technology (MORA), which employs advanced sensor technology and a smart data fusion algorithm while taking advantage of the power of the tongue. Designed as a customized wireless headset/retainer, MORA uses an array of four three-axis magnetic sensors located near user?s cheek / upper pallet. MORA can differentiate user-defined tongue movements from other natural tongue movements, especially those involved in speaking and swallowing without any tracer attachment. To model the usability of the tongue commands using MORA, the research team will first evaluate tongue performance by the number of commands: five, seven, and nine. To evaluate tongue performance by the number of commands and their learning effects, the research team will implement a random command task and a Fitts' law-based multidirectional tapping task. Then, the team will explore various text entry methods (such as H4-Writer, OPTI II, Hex-O-Spell, Metropolis II, EdgeWrite, Multitap) based on three mechanisms: multi-stroke, touchscreen, and gesture recognition, to investigate efficient text entry methods based on discrete tongue commands. MORA will be introduced to users through focus groups in medical facilities such as The Texas Brain and Spine Institute, Bryan, Texas, and the Center for Excellence in Aging Services and Long-Term Care, in the University of Texas at Austin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the past few decades, symplectic geometry has emerged as an exciting and fundamental area of mathematical research, due in part to close connections with many other parts of mathematics as well as physics. It has had especially striking recent applications to topology, the study of geometric shapes and spaces, and particularly the theory of knots, loops of string that are tied together at their ends. The Principal Investigator will apply ideas from symplectic geometry to construct and study invariants of knots as well as geometric spaces in three and higher dimensions. Preliminary past work suggests that these invariants provide a surprising and unexpected bridge between several modern areas of mathematics (symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and quantum knot theory) and physics (string theory, a model for the fundamental forces that shape the universe). This project will explore this bridge, with the goal of creating and strengthening new lines of two-way communication between mathematics and theoretical physics. As part of this project, the Principal Investigator will also promote the training of early-career researchers in mathematics, especially through research experiences in mathematics for undergraduate students. In addition the project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project supported by this award will focus on several related lines of research, all centered around holomorphic curves, which have become central to the modern study of symplectic geometry since work of Gromov in the 1980s. One direction builds on the construction of Fukaya categories, algebraic structures associated to symplectic manifolds that play a key role in Homological Mirror Symmetry. The present project will construct a version of the Fukaya category for contact manifolds, built out of knots in a contact manifold. A key motivation for studying this category for contact manifolds is that it can serve as a central repository for holomorphic-curve invariants of the contact manifold. In particular, it will be a key intermediary in a larger picture that brings together other categories, both geometric (infinitesimal Fukaya categories) and algebraic (microlocal sheaf categories). Another aspect of the project deals with a package of knot invariants called knot contact homology, which has been studied by the Principal Investigator in previous work. This project will investigate the connection between knot contact homology and certain other knot invariants such as HOMFLY-PT polynomials, using recent progress in topological string theory. Goals in this direction include developing a formula for colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials in terms of holomorphic curves and quantizing the augmentation variety, a knot invariant devised from knot contact homology, to produce a recurrence relation for these polynomials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project advances catalytic processing technology that upgrades methane to higher-value chemicals in small plants located at or near the production wells, thus avoiding flaring or costly gas pipeline transport.  The catalysts currently employed in this process do not fulfill the activity and stability requirements necessary to make the process economically viable. The study integrates experimental and theoretical methods to better understand the factors limiting current catalyst performance, and uses that knowledge to guide the design of improved catalysts and processing schemes.  The project also promotes training of graduate and undergraduate students in technologies related to efficient, cost-effective, and low environmental impact utilization of hydrocarbon resources, while promoting outreach to predominantly minority schools to attract K-12 students to STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project targets methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) which constitutes a path for the direct conversion of methane to benzene and hydrogen. Specifically, the project focuses on ZSM-5-supported molybdenum (Mo) catalysts.  Previous work by the investigators has revealed that the specific processes by which a ZSM-5-supported Mo oxide precursor is activated to form Mo carbide species strongly affects the catalytic behavior.  Thus, Mo-C-support interactions play a pivotal role in achieving the stable formation of aromatics.  To further investigate those interactions, model catalysts, with active metals existing only on either the outer surface or within the zeolite channels, will be prepared and evaluated by a suite of experimental and computational tools.  The structure, location, and evolution of the Mo species will be monitored by in situ and operando experiments using advanced characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption and high-resolution powder diffraction.  The experimental data will be combined with density functional theory calculations to advance knowledge with respect to the structure-activity relationship of the catalysts and the reaction pathways involved in the complete MDA catalytic cycle (activation, reaction, deactivation, regeneration).  The combination of kinetic tests, in situ structural characterization, and theoretical calculations will result in the determination of the reaction and deactivation pathways of MDA and will provide the basis for the rational design of catalysts. Beyond the research efforts, the investigators will develop a novel virtual reality (VR) technology module that will allow K-12 students to immerse themselves into a catalyst structure and allow them to directly interact with dynamic 3-D images of the molecules involved in a catalytic process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Synthetic polymers are commonly referred to as plastics and are widely used in our daily lives.  Polymers are long chain macromolecules consisting of many repeating chemical units linked with carbon-carbon bonds.  Their properties are controlled by their chemical structures which can be tailored for different applications.  In this research, a number of chemically-distinct small molecules that trigger temperature response are first prepared and their physical properties investigated.  These molecules are then incorporated into polymer chains at precise locations.  This efficient strategy allows the design of polymer strands with chemical structures that can be pulled apart at one temperature and snapped back together at a different temperature.  The chemistry associated with this award is broadly transferrable to many other polymerization systems and useful to materials chemistry and any other fields in which thermally-responsive plastics are of interest.  This research is having a broader impact by providing unique opportunities for undergraduate students to receive cutting edge research training and education in organic and polymer chemistry.  Apart from incorporating the results associated with this award into chemistry laboratory courses at the university, an outreach program called the Macromolecular Alliance of Community, Resources and Outreach (MACRO) is initiated.  The goal of this program is to create a depository of outreach materials through which individuals can spread their passion and knowledge of science to the general population.<br/> <br/>This work is focused on the development of dynamic-covalent linkages that can be incorporated into polymer systems to enable switchability in polymer topology and bestow thermal responsive properties.  Several studies are carried out in order to achieve this goal.  The first objective focuses on the development of Diels-Alder linkage systems with novel dienes and dienophiles and systematic understanding of the thermal stability of the prepared adducts.  In the second objective, the unsaturated adducts are undergoing 1,4-Michael addition which favors the retro-Diels-Alder cleavage followed by incorporation within polymeric structures using copper catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization.  The last aim explores dynamic covalent chemistry effects on the polymer topology and physical properties with special emphasis on responsive polymer surfactants. Using nucleophiles such as thiols to modulate bond-cleaving temperature is applicable to a variety of other polymerization techniques and has the potential to generate a wide range of new smart soft materials of industrial importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An understanding of the biological mechanisms of NOx reactivity will be advanced by examining the synthetic, biomimetic systems. In particular, the research of Goldberg and Thoi give new fundamental knowledge about pathways to and from nitric oxide and other nitrogen-containing gases as well as ammonia.  One objective is to examine the effect of acids on the way iron interacts with nitrogen oxides. The team also examines new ways to generate HNO, a proposed, key intermediate in the iron-based reactions. The catalysis research entails the use of electrolysis to evaluate the reaction pathways.

The introduction of different synthetic host-guest components, minimizes the dependence on costly long DNA chains, expands the types of inputs that can be utilized within the nanomachines and increases their versatility.  Potential applications include the development of DNA machinery that have catalytic and chemical sensing functions.  In addition to directly impacting nanotechnology, the project broadly impacts multiple scientific disciplines and provides the versatility needed for device development, such as logic gate devices, sensing/diagnostic agents, and autonomous systems. During the course of conducting this project, students are educated and trained in inter-disciplinary chemical research. Furthermore, research is integrated with teaching and community service via a chemistry-based service-learning course that involves Tulane undergraduate students conducting demonstrations at New Orleans K-12 public schools. In addition, the project includes a summer undergraduate research experience for diverse groups of students from mostly underrepresented minorities at neighboring Xavier University.<br/><br/>This project develops cucurbituril 7 (CB7) based host-guest driven toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) as a guiding principle to achieve dynamic supramolecular DNA machines. While conventional Watson-Crick based TMSD has been foundational in the development of elegant molecular devices (such as motors to carry and sort cargo, autonomous robots that control protein activity, and systems that conduct computing tasks), these DNA nanomachines have the drawback that they only harness genetic molecular recognition and thus the scope of inputs that the systems can incorporate (or respond to) is largely limited to nucleic acid sequences. This project utilizes synthetic supramolecular surrogates that can replace (or serve in a complementary fashion to) Watson-Crick base-pairing driven TMSD and thus generates nanomachines that are responsive to a broader variety of stimuli whilst also minimizing the length of the DNA domains that are used. Furthermore, by harnessing host-guest based TMSD, in addition to other salient supramolecular chemistry concepts (including multivalency and entropy-driven product formation), the project develops (a) higher-order supramolecular DNA circuits that are catalyzed by guest-linked DNA and (b) non-enzyme based sensors with the capacity for catalytically amplified fluorescence signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, crystal growth kinetics is monitored with X-rays generated at synchrotron light sources that allow the first moments of crystal formation to be visualized. Mathematical models are developed to describe the evolution of the growing crystals and predict the growth of new materials.

The solute concentration and the nanocrystal size and yield are monitored in real time. The atomic structure of intermediates formed during the nucleation phase is probed in situ using pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X-ray scattering. These studies are complemented by ex situ studies of the precursor conversion reaction and the size dependence of the growth kinetics to arrive at a holistic understanding of each of the coupled phases of the reaction. Rate equation models and structure prediction methods are used to model the evolution of the solute and nanocrystals throughout nucleation and growth. Professor Owen is using a synergistic approach to help determine whether the nucleation mechanism follows a classical process involving a critical nucleus whose radius changes with the supersaturation, a rate limiting transition between specific ?magic size? clusters, crystallization from an amorphous intermediate, or a molecular process. A deeper understanding of crystal nucleation growth can accelerate the design of a broad array of new materials for luminescent displays, solid state lighting, and photovoltaics.

One fruitful way in which manifolds can be studied is through their symmetries, which taken together form an algebraic object called a group. The focus of this project is the interaction between the structure of a manifold, both local (up close) and global (as an ensemble), and its symmetries, or group actions on manifolds for short. The project aims to resolve some basic questions in this area and investigate some new phenomena. Among the problems of particular interest are those concerning smoothness of group actions, in the sense of calculus. A resolution of some of these problems has the potential to yield insight into old open questions about exotic spheres, which are certain manifolds which can be deformed into standard spheres, but only in a highly singular way.  Groups acting on manifolds are a broad class of objects which have received a large amount of attention, and their theory has developed rapidly in recent years. Planned broader impacts include research experiences for undergraduates, conference organization, and a book on right-angled Artin groups.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to these advances in several ways. One area of focus for the project is critical regularity of group actions. Previous work with Kim will be extended in order to compute the critical regularity in one dimension of right-angled Artin groups, which would then be the first natural class of non-nilpotent groups whose precise one-dimensional critical regularity is both finite and known. Moreover, the principal investigator intends to develop critical regularity in higher dimensions, with the goal of encoding the diffeomorphism type of a compact manifold by a set of finitely generated groups. Such a result would give an algebraic approach to the 4-dimensional smooth Poincare conjecture. Another focus of the project is to develop a structure theory for thin subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, with the goal of resolving a conjecture of Shalom about the discreteness of their commensurators. The final main focus of the project is in the area of mapping class groups of surfaces, where the PI has outlined a program to prove the nonlinearity of mapping class groups, and to introduce logic into low dimensional topology by investigating the model theory of the curve graph of a surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central theme in theoretical physics is electric-magnetic duality, the symmetry between electricity and magnetism in Maxwell's equations and its generalization to idealized (supersymmetric) variants of the equations that govern the weak and strong nuclear forces. One of the central themes in number theory is the Langlands program, a profound link between arithmetic and geometry that counts among its successes the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. A surprisingly close analogy between these two themes has been developed in the last decade. This project employs structures that are natural in physics to provide crucial insights missing in the number theory -- specifically, the behavior of boundaries or edges in physics suggests a new understanding of the use of integral calculus in arithmetic. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop new connections between physics and number theory. Electric-magnetic duality, the symmetry between electricity and magnetism (a variant of the Fourier transform), and its generalization (S-duality) to supersymmetric variants of the nonabelian gauge theories that describe fundamental interactions, can be considered analogous to the Langlands program, a profound nonabelian analog of the Fourier transform linking arithmetic questions to the algebra and analysis of symmetry groups. This project will take insights from physics (the understanding of electric-magnetic duality for boundary conditions) and apply them to fundamental problems in number theory (the connection between period integrals and the arithmetic of L-functions). The investigator will work to disseminate physics ideas to number theorists and vice versa, bridging two intellectually distant communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This so-called ""collective behavior"" of electrons in a material often leads to exciting new electronic properties. This project uses microwave radiation to characterize these electronic phases. By understanding the collective behavior, new technology can be developed around it. This project involves early career STEM undergraduate researchers in every aspect of the research. A nanofabrication course that is cross-listed between Physics and Engineering extends the impact of this research by engaging undergraduate and graduate students in related technical fields. Educational outreach components of this project focus on K-12 students in the greater Philadelphia area through partnerships with local libraries as well as public and private schools. These events expose students to hands-on STEM activities that are directly related to the project?s research areas: nanotechnology, electronics, cryogenics, and quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>Technical abstract: Measuring the properties of fragile electronic states in highly-interacting electronic systems is a difficult task. This project employs microwave transmission spectroscopy to study collective electronic states in van der Waals materials at low temperatures and high magnetic fields by coupling microwave radiation to the two-dimensional electron system through an adjacent coplanar waveguide. The transmission of microwave radiation is sensitive to carrier conductivity and the collective oscillations of solid phases associated with pinning to crystal impurities. This project characterizes several electronic solids in graphene and compares these results with transition metal dichalcogenides that have strong spin-orbit interaction. The research also expands the spectroscopic technique to investigate two-dimensional superconductors. This investigation revolves around the recently-questioned dissipationless state that exists below the Berezinskii?Kosterlitz?Thouless transition by measuring the frequency-dependent conductance. Several phases of both electrons and composite fermions are studied: Wigner and Skyrme crystals, stripe phases, superconducting condensates, superconducting vortex lattices, and possibly never-before-seen quantum states. This project addresses fundamental questions at the frontiers of highly interacting electronic systems in materials that will advance the field of quantum electronics and are therefore of the highest interest to broad academic and industrial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding diet choice is essential to solving a wide array of problems, from habitat conservation to medical compliance and nutrition. Taste plays an integral role in diet choice because it conveys nutritional and safety information about the composition of foods. Sweet foods motivate intake, whereas bitter foods are often avoided. To increase intake of bitter vegetables into children?s diets, repeated exposure is a common and powerful method. It is thought that learning about the foods may be sufficient to increase intake. However, previous research by the principal investigator suggests that there may be a shift in the taste of these foods, because repeated exposure can alter production of salivary proteins that change how foods taste. This project will test whether the suite of salivary proteins produced by rats differs based on the specific type of bitter chemicals consumed, how the chemicals and proteins interact with receptors in the mouth versus digestive tract, and how diet-driven changes in salivary proteins act to alter acceptance of nontoxic, bitter foods. This work will be conducted, in part, in the context of a new university research course designed to train underrepresented students in behavioral neuroscience research techniques and will be used as part of a sensory systems and nutrition outreach program in local elementary and high schools. <br/><br/>This research project will test the hypothesis that diet-induced upregulation of salivary proteins (SPs) allows an animal to increase consumption of a sampled, harmless, bitter food, but does not generalize to dangerous toxins. Aim 1 will examine whether the dietary acceptance driven by SPs is specific to the inducing stimulus, by comparing the pattern of SP expression in groups of rats exposed to different classes of bitter plant secondary compounds (PSCs). These animals will complete taste tests for each class of PSC to determine if increased acceptance is generalizable to other, sometimes similar, but more toxic, bitter compounds. Aim 2 will determine if SPs act by altering the negative signals from receptors in the digestive tract. To isolate the effects of SPs on post-oral feedback, licking responses to saccharin solutions will be measured while rats receive intragastric infusions of bitter stimuli dissolved in donor saliva with or without SPs. It is hypothesized that the presence of SPs will block the reduction in licking induced by bitter chemicals under control conditions, by reducing the aversive post-oral input. Aim 3 will test whether indirect exposure to bitter compounds (i.e., in amniotic fluid and milk) is sufficient to alter SP expression in offspring. SP expression of mothers and offspring will be quantified after maternal diet experience with PSCs to test for vertical transmission of diet preference. This research will extend knowledge of taste physiology by identifying a physiological mechanism for experience-based alterations in diet acceptance. The research findings will have broader applications to the fields of foraging ecology and human nutrition. The project integrates education and outreach activities with the research, and will train two graduate and 15-20 undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its numerous advantages and the many technological advancements to support it, there remain numerous challenges. Remote collaborators struggle to maintain shared awareness, mutual understanding, and coordination, leading to frustration and time and monetary loss. Recently, dual eye tracking technology has been explored as a novel way of enhancing remote synchronous collaboration. Through gaze sharing, the process where two collaborators can see each other's point of gaze visualized on their individual screens in real time, remote collaborators in diverse settings have seen improvements in the quality and outcome of their interactions. This project will explore previously overlooked dimensions of remote collaboration and how it is affected by gaze sharing. In particular, it will investigate the communication channel that is used in conjunction with gaze sharing and will explore how gaze awareness affects multi-party groups that go beyond the traditionally studied pairs. This project will be a first step toward understanding how contextual gaze sharing can intelligently support remote collaboration in realistic scenarios that include multiple collaborators.<br/><br/>Research on real-time gaze sharing has shown that it is a promising way to alleviate some of the limitations of lack of collocation by increasing shared awareness. However, prior gaze sharing studies have not considered the medium of communication and have only studied its effect on communication during audio calls. With the prevalence of text-based communication, it is important to systematically examine the combined effect of the communication medium and shared gaze on collaboration. The first phase of this project will explore gaze sharing as an additional signal to instant messaging and will contrast it to audio-based communication. Using existing communication theories, it will examine the joint effect of gaze sharing and primary channel of communication on collaboration through metrics that include gaze overlap, efficiency, effectiveness, and cognitive workload. The second phase of this project will focus on the group size of remote teams. Gaze sharing has been shown to be particularly effective in studies that include pairs, but it is unclear whether these positive effects would persist in multi-party groups. This project will explore the effect of gaze sharing on multiple collaborators through the development and release of a free and open-source writing platform that will allow multi-party gaze sharing. A user study on writing with groups of varying sizes will follow to uncover whether visualizing multiple gaze locations will be detrimental rather than beneficial to the quality of the collaboration and its outcome. The findings of this project will offer recommendations for future technologies that support multi-party collaborations through the use of different communication media and gaze sharing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, new, safe, non-invasive methods for the treatment of brain disorders are critically needed. Non-invasive techniques including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation have had some success. However, progress has been limited due to poor understanding of the interactions of magnetic fields with nervous tissue. The molecular/cellular mechanisms of nervous tissue under TMS are still lacking. Hence, investigation of effects of transient magnetic fields on adult neurogenesis, cell differentiation and plasticity of nervous tissue (neurospheres) is essential in developing new treatment procedures and achieving the use of TMS as a neuromodulation tool for treating neurological disorders. The educational goal of this project is to effectively integrate research with educational activities and to train both undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary studies to produce next-generation bioengineers. The PIs will develop a new Vertically Integrated Program (VIP) based on this research proposal entitled: Targeting Neurodegenerative Diseases Using Bioengineering Approaches. The VIP will unite undergraduate education and faculty research in a team-based context.  The overall educational goal is to help next-generation workforce development by training students to carry out research with sound technical background and allowing them to gain hands-on laboratory skills for their advanced careers. The long-term goal is to design an automatic technical platform to synthesize a variety of in vitro central nervous system disease models to mimic in vivo conditions as closely as possible. This will facilitate the studies of TMS effects and drug screening assays for neurodegenerative disorders.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to develop a chip-based microfluidics platform that facilitates the rapid formation of three-dimensional in vitro cell culture models of the central nervous system, which will permit the investigation of mechanisms of organ development, cellular interactions, disease model progression under magnetic field stimulation and drug treatments within de?ned microenvironments.  Specifically, the proposed efforts include (1) the development of a chip consisting of microchamber arrays so that neurospheres including diseased neurospheres such as Alzheimer?s disease (AD) neurospheres can be fabricated in an efficient manner; and (2) the studies of the behavior of healthy neurospheres and AD neurospheres under transient magnetic stimulation (MS) and drug treatment using this chip. Major innovations of this proposed project can be summarized as the following: (1) Using this type of microfluidic chip, large-scale neurospheres with tunable and quantitative compositions can be synthesized rapidly and inexpensively, facilitating studies of different types of neurospheres; (2) Using a concentration gradient generator at the upper stream of this chip, a series of AD models (AD neurospheres) with known concentrations of amyloid-? and/or phosphorylated-tau can be readily fabricated; and (3) developing this chip will thus facilitate studies of the effects of both MS and drug treatment on AD models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both  scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. Relationships between on-farm crop diversity and food and income security have long been of interest to scholars and development practitioners. The REU Site at the University of Vermont (UVM) provides eight U.S. students from diverse backgrounds an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research on crop diversity and livelihoods among smallholder farmers. Under the eight-week REU, students spend four weeks on the UVM campus in Burlington, Vermont where they train in spatial analysis, survey analysis using existing large farm and household datasets, qualitative research methods, and written and oral communication. They then conduct original research on on-farm crop diversity, regional crop diversity, nutrition, and rural livelihoods. Students thus have the chance to contribute to multi-dimensional research while developing theoretical and methodological skills, and engaging in cross-cultural partnerships. Building on the model of a previous REU Site, this program provides participants with a unique cultural and educational experience, while offering the chance to conduct original research in a supportive REU setting. Recruitment is open to any NSF eligible undergraduate students, though the program is designed to promote participation by low-income students, first generation college students, and students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This REU Site contributes to active scholarly debates around how production of diverse crops relates to food and income security. Working with mentors from UVM, the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC), Pennsylvania State University, Sterling College, and the international research center Bioversity International, REU participants actively engage in the design and implementation of research on crop diversity and livelihoods across geographic scales including: (i) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyses using public and commercial datasets; (ii) statistical analyses using large, nationally representative household surveys (e.g., DHS, LSMS-ISA); and (iii) field-based surveys and interviews, working with local partners to verify findings from secondary data and further explore how crop and food choices relate to geographic, economic and cultural factors. We also provide innovative methods linking newly available geospatial datasets and large household survey datasets, and testing patterns that emerge from secondary analyses via primary data collection with local partners. Results are disseminated widely through meetings of community partners, a customized website, co-authored student publications in economics, rural sociology and interdisciplinary journals, and student participation in professional conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is the study of geometry where you identify one geometric object with another if one can be deformed into the other. The goal of algebraic topology is to ascribe discrete algebraic invariants to these geometric objects to distinguish their topological types.  In this way, distinguishing geometric objects is reduced to algebraic computations.  Understanding the topological type of geometric objects is a fundamental act of scientific/mathematical inquiry, comparable to the study of prime numbers, or the classification of the fundamental particles that constitute matter and carry forces.  Topological computations have recently been applied to solve problems in solid state physics.  Also, data involving the interrelation of a large number of variables naturally traces out a geometric object in a high dimensional space.  The study of such data-sets using algebraic topology is the subject of the new and active field of topological data analysis.  The focus of these projects is in the interaction of classical algebraic topology, equivariant homotopy theory, and motivic homotopy theory.  Equivariant homotopy theory is the study of the topology of symmetry, whereas motivic homotopy theory is the study of the topology of solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  Recent years have witnessed a dazzling array of progress in the field of algebraic topology through the importation of equivariant and motivic methods. Broader impacts of these projects include work with graduate students, a summer math research program, a directed reading program, and a bridge program for entering graduate students.<br/><br/>Particular projects involve investigating novel structures in equivariant and motivic stable homotopy theory, and seek to leverage these structures to give new approaches to some long outstanding problems in classical stable homotopy theory.  The telescope conjecture will be investigated using a tower of spectra which appeared in the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel solution of the Kervaire Invariant One Problem.  Recent work of Pstragowski and Gheorghe-Isaksen-Krause-Ricka gives a synthetic construction of complex motivic stable homotopy theory.  The principal investigator plans to extend this to the real motivic context using equivariant homotopy theory.  Another project uses equivariant chromatic homotopy theory to study the interaction of classical chromatic homotopy theory with the Tate construction, with the aim of making progress on the chromatic splitting conjecture.  Recent work of Barthel-Schlank-Stapleton gives a means of studying stable homotopy theory at generic primes using ultra-filters.

Faster algorithms will both accelerate computations that can already be performed, and enable computations that are beyond the reach of existing methods. More energy efficient algorithms will help to reduce the power consumption of data centers, and to extend the battery life of mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers. The fundamental innovation behind our approach is to harness mathematical properties of large collections of random numbers to build new stochastic algorithms that dramatically outperform existing deterministic ones. In a nutshell, the idea is to use randomized sampling, and randomized averaging, to reduce the effective dimensionality of the problems to be processed. In addition the project provides research training opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.<br/><br/>We seek to develop computationally efficient methods for solving linear systems of equations involving large numbers of variables, both in terms of asymptotic complexity, and in terms of practical speed at realistic problem sizes. Such systems of equations arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, and solving them is often the bottleneck in terms of time that decides how large of a problem can be handled. In particular, this is what limits how large of a data set can be analyzed, or how realistic a computational simulation can be when modelling some physical phenomenon. By developing faster and more efficient algorithms, we will accelerate computations that are done today, and enable many others that are outside the reach of currently existing methods.  The project is premised on the recent development of new randomized algorithms for solving linear algebraic problems. Such methods have proven to dramatically outperform classical deterministic methods for certain tasks such as computing low rank factorizations to matrices - the crucial computational step in e.g. Principal Component Analysis, the PageRank algorithm by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, numerical coarse graining when modeling complex multiscale systems, and many more. Randomized algorithms have also been used to build faster solvers for linear systems. However, while the theoretical results obtained at this point are extremely encouraging, it remains to develop randomized linear solvers that are decisively faster in practical applications. To achieve this goal, the project will support a research group that brings together four researchers with complementary skills in numerical linear algebra, random matrix theory, computational harmonic analysis, optimization, and high performance computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yarkony of Johns Hopkins University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry. The goal of the award is to build computational models of processes that convert light energy into chemical energy, but can not produce the reverse reaction.  These are called nonadiabatic processes. Nonadiabatic processes are involved in many important processes including vision, photosynthesis and protecting our DNA against the dangers of the ultraviolet component of sunlight. Professor Yarkony and his research group produce computational models using high speed digital computers. The tools they develop add subtle but important interactions to their existing model that can alter the outcome of a predicted nonadiabatic event. Scientists frequently use light energy in an attempt to manipulate the outcome of a chemical reaction. If the computational model is sufficiently accurate, computer simulations can guide and inform experiments. If the model is inaccurate, incorrect inferences are obtained. Professor Yarkony has identified a class of light induced molecular breakup processes for which a decades-old standard model fails. His group continues to study this failure to establish its prevalence and the consequences of the errors. Professor Yarkony mentors a group of students and postdocs. Together they develop software that can be used by the community to explore the new methods.<br/><br/>The Yarkony group is using fit coupled diabatic state electronic Hamiltonians to study nonadiabatic processes. They take advantage of the key strengths of fit representations, which is the use of wave functions that include both static and dynamic correlations. Nuclear quantum effects including the geometric phase (GP) and tunneling are calculated. In order to treat intense laser fields and spin-changing processes, dipole and spin orbit coupling terms must also be represented. The Yarkony group uses a two-step approach in which Gaussian Process Regression is used followed by the application of neural network techniques. The ability to extend the range of problems that can be treated in this way provides an important new tool to treat nonadiabatic processes. The accuracy of the diabatic potential energy matrix is improved, while quantum tunneling can be treated rigorously and the GP is properly included in full and reduced dimensionality representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Downward social mobility, or the movement of an individual from an advantaged to a disadvantaged socioeconomic position, is an increasingly common experience. Downward mobility is hypothesized to lead to undesirable outcomes, such as deteriorating mental health, increased violence, and early mortality. Due to limitations of existing methods, valid empirical evidence has been lacking on the effects of social mobility for a wide variety of policy-relevant outcomes. This project will address the methodological weaknesses of existing scientific work on social mobility. Using existing data from two NSF-supported studies, the investigators also will examine the individual-level consequences of social mobility. The empirical application of the approaches developed in this project will provide training opportunities for graduate students. A user-friendly software package and an open-access online tool will be developed to increase access to and use of the newly developed methods by researchers, policymakers, and analysts. <br/><br/>This research project will develop a new approach to partially identify the effect of social mobility net of the effects of origin and destination. By developing new techniques to disentangle the effects of social mobility from the consequences of socioeconomic position, the project will provide insights on how researchers can obtain reliable estimates from statistical models applied to rank-deficient or high-dimensional data. The new methods will be applied to data from the General Social Survey and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Investigators will examine the effects of mobility experiences on individuals' well-being (such as perceived happiness and stress), attitudes (such as social trust and out-group bias), and behaviors (such as marriage and fertility).

Although the Mississippi River is the most the significant threat to floodplain communities in the American Bottom, a system of floodplain channels has triggered some of the most widespread and damaging incidents of flooding. In some cases, substantial infilling with sediment and woody material has caused these channels to literally pour into some of the most economically vulnerable communities in the US. In this EAGER proposal, the investigators will apply a new model in the practice of geomorphology, in which scientists and community members collaborate in inquiry and data collection. They will focus their initial efforts in the community of Centreville, Illinois, where the impacts of flooding have been the most damaging. They will work directly with the community to better constrain the causes and impacts of severe flooding, and to broaden their engagement with communities of the Greater St. Louis region, they are partnering with Harris-Stowe State University to offer four summer internships to rising seniors of the university. Their goal is to build meaningful and empowering undergraduate research experiences for underrepresented minorities by designing those experiences around civic engagement and environmental science.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to demonstrate how community-centered research that is applied to managed and inhabited landscapes can, at the same time, lead to novel and impactful insights into landscape evolution. In their case, the focus is on floodplain channels of the American Bottom. Floodplain channels have been a focus of research in geomorphology for some time, but these previous efforts have largely focused on floodplain channels whose very forms are produced and controlled by lowland rivers. Floodplain channels whose forms and function are largely independent of lowland rivers, but instead are a product of upland drainages, are much less understood. The investigators will provide the first geomorphological assessment of the floodplain channels of the American Bottom, including both natural and modified reaches. By integrating field surveys, sediment coring, and numerical experiments the investigators will: 1) calculate sediment supply rates from bluff drainages into floodplain channels; 2) determine how and why sediment transport capacity varies along floodplain channels; and 3) identify flood risks associated with channel infilling for Centreville.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Faster algorithms will both accelerate computations that can already be performed, and enable computations that are beyond the reach of existing methods. More energy efficient algorithms will help to reduce the power consumption of data centers, and to extend the battery life of mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers. The fundamental innovation behind our approach is to harness mathematical properties of large collections of random numbers to build new stochastic algorithms that dramatically outperform existing deterministic ones. In a nutshell, the idea is to use randomized sampling, and randomized averaging, to reduce the effective dimensionality of the problems to be processed. In addition the project provides research training opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.<br/><br/>We seek to develop computationally efficient methods for solving linear systems of equations involving large numbers of variables, both in terms of asymptotic complexity, and in terms of practical speed at realistic problem sizes. Such systems of equations arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, and solving them is often the bottleneck in terms of time that decides how large of a problem can be handled. In particular, this is what limits how large of a data set can be analyzed, or how realistic a computational simulation can be when modelling some physical phenomenon. By developing faster and more efficient algorithms, we will accelerate computations that are done today, and enable many others that are outside the reach of currently existing methods.  The project is premised on the recent development of new randomized algorithms for solving linear algebraic problems. Such methods have proven to dramatically outperform classical deterministic methods for certain tasks such as computing low rank factorizations to matrices - the crucial computational step in e.g. Principal Component Analysis, the PageRank algorithm by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, numerical coarse graining when modeling complex multiscale systems, and many more. Randomized algorithms have also been used to build faster solvers for linear systems. However, while the theoretical results obtained at this point are extremely encouraging, it remains to develop randomized linear solvers that are decisively faster in practical applications. To achieve this goal, the project will support a research group that brings together four researchers with complementary skills in numerical linear algebra, random matrix theory, computational harmonic analysis, optimization, and high performance computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Don Tilley at the University of California, Berkeley, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry within the National Science Foundation, focuses on the synthesis of chemical compounds that contain both metals and silicon. These substances play key roles in the production of useful silicon-based materials, such as silicone plastics, adhesives, lubricants, and semiconductors. New metal-silicon compounds promise to enhance current applications and underpin the invention of new silicon-based products. In one project, Tilley is studying a new class of compounds that feature silicon atoms sandwiched between a pair of metal ions. Another project is exploring the possible replacement of platinum with iron for making silicones. Overall, this program is preparing graduate and undergraduate students for technical careers by training them in cutting edge chemical techniques as well as in communication skills. This grant is also supporting outreach to students in high school and elementary schools with the goal of enhancing their technical knowledge and stimulating their interests in science.  This outreach involves oral presentations, demonstrations, and hands-on interactive lessons. <br/><br/>The research program of Professor T. Don Tilley at the University of California, Berkeley, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry within the National Science Foundation, explores the synthesis, bonding properties, and reaction chemistry of transition-metal complexes featuring multiple bonds to silicon. Of these multiply bonded species, silylene (LnM=SiRR?) and silicide ([LnM]xSi; x = 2,3,4) complexes are of particular interest due to their roles in (for example) hydrosilations and silicon materials synthesis, respectively. The extensive metal-silicon bonding featured by these species is expected to impart unusual properties upon the coordinated silicon fragments, and these are being exploited to design reactive catalysts of strong interest to the research and industrial catalysis communities. A novel theme within this program is the development of synthetic routes leading to molecular silicide complexes, as well as the exploration of chemical properties for the new silicides. These rare species represent an underexplored area of transition metal-main group research.  Fundamental questions regarding molecular silicide chemistry have important implications for the development of advanced silicon materials and processes.  More broadly, this research provides a foundation for new strategies relating to chemical transformations that produce silicon materials, polymers, drugs, and silylated feedstock and specialty chemicals. In particular, the study of molecular silicides provides insights into the structure and reactivity of chemical intermediates in silicones production (e.g., alkylchlorosilanes in the Direct Process) and in the synthesis of silicon nanostructures. This research may  contribute to the knowledge base that chemists use to design reactions that are fundamentally and industrially relevant. Because this research uses a broad array of synthetic and spectroscopic techniques, the scientists trained through this program emerge as highly  effective researchers. Notably, a collaborative effort within the research group involves planning and presenting science lessons to grade school students. Group members travel to nearby elementary schools and teach basic scientific principles, hoping to improve early STEM education and encourage budding scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The running application example is that of an urban highway network in which a portion of the vehicles are autonomously operated. The core question is this: how should a system planner design the routing policies of the autonomous vehicles to have the greatest positive impact on overall network traffic congestion, even if human drivers react in a self-interested way to the behavior of the autonomous vehicles? Intuitively, it would appear beneficial to design the autonomous vehicles to be altruistic; that is, to select highway routes that cause the least congestion to other drivers. However, recent work shows that this simple and intuitive routing design policy may backfire, leading to a cascade of behaviors which inadvertently worsens congestion. This project will investigate how a designer can circumvent these pathologies through the design of smart routing policies. One of the key questions this project will address is how selfish should autonomous vehicles be? This project includes public outreach to help members of the public discern between good and bad modes of influence in socially networked autonomous systems. In addition, it will provide a theoretical framework for engineering practitioners to certify that the interactive aspects of smart systems have been designed to provide broad societal benefits in a principled way.<br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental behavior design questions for socially-networked multiagent systems; an intrinsic feature of this problem is that overall system performance is governed not only by the designable behavior of the autonomous agents, but also on the self-interested behavior of human participants. The element of interactive optimization places this project squarely in the domain of game theory, and the investigators adapt popular congestion game models to study these questions in the context of smart autonomous vehicle routing in highway networks. A fleet of autonomous vehicles is modeled as a discrete player in a continuous-player-set network congestion game; the project studies how routing policies for the autonomous vehicles impact the game-theoretic equilibria of the overall system. This allows the investigators to model, in a principled way, the interactions between designed agents (i.e., autonomous vehicles) and selfish agents (i.e., human drivers). Ultimately, the investigators seek a comprehensive understanding of how and when autonomous vehicles should be endowed with various routing policies. This project advances knowledge in two distinct dimensions: first, it provides an in-depth case study examining the opportunities and limitations of the use of connected autonomous vehicles for influencing traffic routing in transportation networks. Second, and more broadly, it will provide the foundations for an underlying theory of social influence in smart and connected cyber-physical systems. As smart cyber-physical devices are increasingly integrated into public life, it is critical that these smart devices are designed to interact with and influence human behavior in ways that are effective, efficient, and principled ? and this project represents a central pillar of this endeavor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the Mississippi River is the most the significant threat to floodplain communities in the American Bottom, a system of floodplain channels has triggered some of the most widespread and damaging incidents of flooding. In some cases, substantial infilling with sediment and woody material has caused these channels to literally pour into some of the most economically vulnerable communities in the US. In this EAGER proposal, the investigators will apply a new model in the practice of geomorphology, in which scientists and community members collaborate in inquiry and data collection. They will focus their initial efforts in the community of Centreville, Illinois, where the impacts of flooding have been the most damaging. They will work directly with the community to better constrain the causes and impacts of severe flooding, and to broaden their engagement with communities of the Greater St. Louis region, they are partnering with Harris-Stowe State University to offer four summer internships to rising seniors of the university. Their goal is to build meaningful and empowering undergraduate research experiences for underrepresented minorities by designing those experiences around civic engagement and environmental science.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to demonstrate how community-centered research that is applied to managed and inhabited landscapes can, at the same time, lead to novel and impactful insights into landscape evolution. In their case, the focus is on floodplain channels of the American Bottom. Floodplain channels have been a focus of research in geomorphology for some time, but these previous efforts have largely focused on floodplain channels whose very forms are produced and controlled by lowland rivers. Floodplain channels whose forms and function are largely independent of lowland rivers, but instead are a product of upland drainages, are much less understood. The investigators will provide the first geomorphological assessment of the floodplain channels of the American Bottom, including both natural and modified reaches. By integrating field surveys, sediment coring, and numerical experiments the investigators will: 1) calculate sediment supply rates from bluff drainages into floodplain channels; 2) determine how and why sediment transport capacity varies along floodplain channels; and 3) identify flood risks associated with channel infilling for Centreville.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principal investigator and his collaborators have shown that analytical theory called the single level model (SLM) accurately describes the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for certain benchmark molecular junctions in the tunneling regime. In this project, the research team probe the generality of the SLM for describing molecular tunneling in a variety of systems with particular attention to the impact of intermolecular interactions and surface attachment chemistry. In the hopping regime, the emphasis is on understanding the precise nature of the intramolecular charge-transfer transition states in pi-conjugated oligomers, particularly the transition state energy (height of the free energy barrier) and the associated bond length and angle deformations.

Like human language, bird songs can change over time and across the range of a given species. The evolution of song differences is thought to be an important component in the formation of new bird species. However, biologists' understanding how bird songs evolve over space and time, and what causes their evolution, is incompletely known. This project will analyze decades of field recordings made by ornithologists and birding enthusiasts, combined with existing genetic data, to test hypotheses related to the evolution of bird song in multiple species across the continental United States. It will develop software to evaluate differences in bird calls across the range of many species and integrate these data with data on genetic, geographic, and environmental variation to test hypotheses about the causes and consequences of bird song evolution. This project will involve collaboration with computer scientists and software engineers to advance the field of computational biology and ""big data"" analysis for biological questions. Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to participate in the research, learn important skills in computational biology, and have novel experiences inside and outside of the classroom.<br/> <br/>Birds are well known for possessing a diverse array of songs and calls that mediate social behavior, reproduction, and communication. Within a single species, bird vocalizations change through space and time due to the influence of drift, selection and mate choice, but there is a relative lack of knowledge about how biogeographic history and community dynamics across larger regions influence the evolution of bird vocalizations and speciation. This project will use large datasets available both for bird vocalizations and phylogeography to analyze relationships between vocalizations, geography, history, and community composition, for multiple species, on a continental scale. The project will assess the impact that Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles had on phylogeography and vocalizations within species and across communities and test hypotheses regarding the evolutionary drivers of song divergence. The proposed work will develop pipelines to collect massive amounts of song data, process it algorithmically, integrate it into existing pipelines for the analysis of phylogeographic data, contrast these data to environmental predictor variables, and ultimately test hypotheses of divergence. This work will provide the groundwork for the integration of phenotypic and genetic databases to investigate diversification of bird vocalization on a global scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microtubules are dynamic polymeric assemblies that organize the insides of cells, mediate faithful segregation of the genetic material during cell division, and provide tracks for motor-based transport. The research will focus on microtubule nucleation, the poorly understood process by which ??-tubulin units self-assemble to initiate a new microtubule. The project will reveal and quantify how structural and biochemical properties of the individual ??-tubulin building blocks determine the rate of microtubule nucleation and the sequence of oligomeric intermediates that precede formation of a new microtubule, and how these vary in ??-tubulins from different species. The project also emphasizes an educational impact. Graduate students working on the project will receive interdisciplinary training that includes quantitative biochemistry and computational modeling. Outreach partnerships with local elementary and middle schools will bring the excitement of doing science to underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students, while providing teachers and their pupils access to high-tech, but relatively inexpensive, digital microscopes to facilitate curiosity-based learning and discovery. <br/><br/>The specific research objective of this proposal is to create a molecular understanding of microtubule nucleation. Dynamic properties of microtubules derive from the biochemical properties of individual ??-tubulin subunits and their interactions within the polymeric assembly. MT nucleation ? the formation of a new polymer from unpolymerized subunits ? is a poorly understood behavior that is critical for building MT networks and it is highly regulated by cellular factors. The research will use computational and experimental approaches to address three specific goals: (i) to develop a mechanistic understanding of microtubule nucleation in a simplified setting where ??-tubulin GTPase activity has been suppressed, (ii) to use Monte Carlo simulations to create a more exact and generalizable description of the biochemical mechanisms that control MT nucleation in a way that can account for the effects of GTPase activity, (iii) to use protein engineering to assemble and trap defined oligomers of ??-tubulin that would otherwise be too unstable to work with, and to use these oligomers for new kinds of structural, biochemical, and mechanistic studies.

Shimizu of the University of South Carolina is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the role of non-bonding interactions in the stabilization of the transition state between reactants and products.  Catalysts are frequently used to speed up chemical reactions and make them more selective for the desired product. A key challenge in catalysis development is enhancing the ability of catalysts to bring together molecules into crowded reactive structures know as transitions states.  Professor Shimizu and his students are constructing molecular machines (rotors) that assist in the fundamental understanding and optimization of catalyst reactivity.  The molecular rotors are designed to assess factors that simplify the formation of these crowded reactive structures via changes in the speed of their rotation.  Thus, the molecular rotors provide a simple and systemic way to study and improve catalyst design.  The development of new and improved catalysts enables the efficient production of new chemicals, polymers, fuels, and pharmaceuticals.  Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in research methods, in particular women chemists through a collaboration with faculty and students at a local women?s college. A graduate course is developed to provide students with fundamental skills, such as how to present seminars, time and research management strategies, and how to write research publications and proposals.     <br/>	<br/>The ability of non-covalent interactions to stabilize transition states is measured using a series of molecular rotors.  The rotors form non-covalent interactions in their planar transition states.  The stabilizing effects of the non-covalent interactions can be measured from the increase in speed of the molecular rotors.  The versatility and modularity of the rotor framework enables the study of a wide range of non-covalent interactions including hydrogen bonds, cation-pi, anion-pi, n-pi*, chalcogen-chalcogen, CH-pi, arene-arene, OH-pi, and metal-pi interactions. The transition state effects are easily and accurately assessed by measuring the rotational barriers using dynamic NMR spectroscopy.  Finally, the rigid framework limits the degrees of freedom in the ground and transition states enabling accurate modeling and simulation using standard DFT methods, which provide computational-corroboration of the experimentally measured barriers, transition state structures, and insights into the origins of the stabilizing effects.  The project broadly impacts the development of new strategies to improve synthetic catalysts and provides insights into the large rate accelerations in enzymatic systems.  In addition, the development of a new strategy for studying and interrogating transition state energies using molecular rotors provides chemists with new tools for fundamental kinetic studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, there has been a rising imperative to capitalize on the current technological advancements to address to the most pressing issues surrounding construction and the built environment to increase health and safety; productivity; and sustainability. This Elements project combines the areas of computer science, electrical engineering, and construction and building to develop a robust cyberinfrastructure (CI) service for construction research, as well as applications that utilize state-of-the-art emerging technologies and software to address the current challenges faced by the construction industry. The major contribution of the project is the development of the IoT-ACRES (IoT-Applied Construction Research and Education Services) system,  a central, interoperable framework hub that can incorporate a variety of heterogeneous sensors, technology, software, managed by a software-defined network infrastructure and optimized by machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The prototype system will help to augment the works and/or safety manager's ability to detect hazards and subsequently improve safety performance in construction, which is one of the greatest challenges faced by the construction industry. In addition, the framework can be used to increase autonomy in applications that require simultaneous tracking of multiple entities (people, vehicles, equipment, etc.), detecting multiple objects of interests, analyzing real-time biometric data, and making autonomous decisions. Results will be disseminated to industry and research communities through publications and presentations at workshops, training courses and online professional certification programs.

However, the mechanical properties limit intimate integration and conformal contact with living organ systems because the paper is easy to tear and not stretchable. To advance papertronics into bio-integrated soft bioelectronics, paper?s mechanical properties will be modified to make it stretchable while keeping the fibrous structure with bioinert chemical properties to take full advantage of paper?s intrinsic characteristics. The stretchable paper, new material and platform, will be the foundations of the next generation of the papertronics and paperfluidics. Indeed, the stretchable paper can transform into a new domain of interdisciplinary studies putting together basic material science research and engineering sciences to establish groundbreaking innovations. The systematically studied fabrication parameters will accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing, especially in flexible hybrid electronics, and further will be transformed into the production process for use by industry. Knowledge will be disseminated through the development of an educational workshop for STEM teachers, peer-reviewed publications, classroom teaching, student mentoring, and full participation of minorities, women, and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to revolutionize paper-based electronics by creating advances in the stretchable co-axial nonwoven fibrous mat using electrospinning technologies. The stretchable papers consist of thin, soft, and core-sheath fibrous platform that will allow becoming elastic but maintaining chemical properties of the paper while using silicone elastomer and cellulose for core material and outer sheath polymer, respectively. Our project involves three objectives to investigate stretchable papertronics. The specific aims are as follows: (1) the thin, nanomesh cellulose coated elastomeric silicone-based polymer substrates will be investigated for mechanically, and biochemically compatible bioelectronics; (2) the stretchable paper will be characterized its physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. The relationship between the fiber diameter and core (or sheath) thickness with processing parameters will be systematically studied. Additionally, the compatibility to the conventional printing technologies will be tested to develop the stretchable paper into functional electronics.; (3) the elastomeric paper-based microbial fuel cell (MFC) will be demonstrated as model papertronics. The 3D cellulose-coated PDMS nanofibers will serve as a substrate for MFC, which generates power for soft bioelectronics with conformal contact with the organ system. Overall, the study of the paper-based electronics validated with the stretchable paper will offer a comprehensive understanding of future developments in the biomechanically compatible papertronics and paperfluidics for inflammatory-free, long-term biomedical applications as well as the environment- and cost-friendly solutions in manufacturing and disposal engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vibrational excitation of the structures will be used to turn on/off electronic coupling pathways, thus inducing large changes in electron fluxes. The switching will be sensitive to the symmetry and normal mode structure of the molecules. The project explores the core enigma of quantum mechanics in the framework of molecules, with important future links to materials for sensing, communications, and energy science. The intensive collaboration of an interdisciplinary team will design, synthesize, measure, and analyze electronic propagation through customized double-slit style molecular structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations of general relativity - called Einstein?s equations - are quite complicated and can be solved exactly, i.e. with pencil and paper, only under very special and unrealistic circumstances.  Modeling more general scenarios requires computer simulations.  Ongoing research efforts supported by this award aim at developing methods and approaches for such computer simulations, and to use these simulations to explore processes in relativistic astrophysics and general relativity.  In the next few years this will include unresolved questions pertaining to the nature of general relativity ? can arbitrarily small black holes form? ? as well as effects of radiation in newly formed neutron stars and on black-hole accretion.  Undergraduate students will participate in these activities, providing them with a ?hands-on? research experience, and generating a research-enriched learning environment at Bowdoin College.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of these research efforts include the development and implementation of numerical algorithms for the solution of Einstein's equations of general relativity, as well as their application in the numerical modeling of relativistic objects, in particular neutron stars and black holes.  In the next funding period these activities will focus on projects in two main areas, namely critical phenomena in the gravitational collapse to black holes, and dynamical effects of radiation.  With regard to the former, the focus will be on situations in which the critical solution cannot be spherically symmetric. Building on experience and insights from previous work on critical collapse, these phenomena will be explored for the collapse of gravitational waves in vacuum spacetimes, an important problem that remains poorly understood even 25 years after it was first tackled.  With regard to the latter, an approximate treatment of radiation transfer will be implemented and used to explore several scenarios in which radiation may play an important dynamical role.  Examples include the evolution of supermassive stars up to the onset of radial instability, possible non-axisymmetric instabilities triggered by cooling in proto-neutron stars, and an exploration of super-Eddington flows in accretion onto black holes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The United States is estimated to lose 25-30% of its agricultural production to insect attack, while estimates for tropical countries are as high as 50%. Damage from insect feeding and implementation of methods to reduce this damage cost American farmers about $40 billion annually. However, all plants have varying levels of natural protection against insect herbivory, including both mechanical barriers such has hairs and thorns and chemical defenses that deter or kill insect pests. Additionally, plants can emit volatile signals to recruit predators that consume the attacking insects. Although some defenses are always present, others are turned on only when the plants detect insect feeding. This defense induction is orchestrated by a hormone signaling pathway that is highly conserved in the plant kingdom. The proposed research is focused on identifying and investigating novel components of the defense signaling pathway in maize, the most important food crop in the United States. The identification of natural variation in the resistance of maize to insect feeding will provide new opportunities for breeding plants that are more pest tolerant. In addition, the project will provide authentic research experiences to undergraduate students, including students from groups that are underrepresented in science. A proposed outreach component of the project will expose the broader community to research on plant-insect interactions.<br/> <br/>The jasmonic acid signaling cascade, which regulates the transcriptomic responses of plants to insect attack, influences the expression of thousands of genes. Despite the global importance of maize (Zea mays) as a crop species and the critical role of jasmonates in regulating plant defense responses, the maize jasmonic acid signaling cascade remains relatively uninvestigated compared to the corresponding pathways in well-studied model plant species such as Arabidopsis and tomato. Considering the evolutionary distance between these model dicots and maize, it is reasonable to expect distinct jasmonic acid regulatory mechanisms in the defense responses of this economically important monocot species. An integrated systems biology approach, involving transcriptomic, metabolomic, and genetic methods, will be used to uncover and characterize novel aspects of defense regulation in maize. A genetically diverse population of maize inbred lines will be used to assess natural variation in the accumulation of herbivore-induced jasmonate and jasmonate-like molecules, identify previously unknown regulators of defense responses, and elucidate their roles in maize defense against two lepidopteran pests, fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda) and beet armyworms (Spodoptera exigua). In addition to providing the scientific community with insight into the regulation of defense responses in maize, the planned studies will generate high-quality transcriptomic and metabolomic data sets that will enable other researchers to conduct further investigations of natural variation in maize defense responses. A graduate student and a postdoc will receive research training and will gain mentoring experience by helping to supervise the experiments of undergraduate students contributing on this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such motor protein, dynein, is important for moving cargo from the periphery of cells toward the center. In human cells, dynein needs to partner with another protein (dynactin) in order to move cargo across long distances, such as along nerve cells. The control or regulation of how these two proteins interact determines what, when, and where cargo are transported in a cell. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Nikolaus Loening from Lewis & Clark College to determine how the interactions between these two proteins are regulated by changes in the structure of dynein. Dr. Loening focuses on dynein intermediate chain, a part of the motor protein that initiates binding with dynactin, and studies how variations in its sequence and the addition of phosphate chemical groups change its binding behavior. The intermediate chain is difficult to study because it does not normally adopt a fixed and rigid shape; it is intrinsically disordered. Consequently, a variety of biophysical techniques are used to study the effects of these structural variations on the intermediate chain?s shape and its interactions with dynactin. This project provides undergraduate and high school students with opportunities to participate directly in this research. In addition, some parts of this research are incorporated into laboratory and special topics classes at Lewis & Clark College, thereby broadening participation in this project to include a larger number of undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This research project characterizes the structural properties of a little-studied isoform of the dynein intermediate chain (IC) to better localize the interaction between IC and its binding partners. The objective of this project is to develop a structural model for how an intrinsically disordered region of IC binds with the p150Glued subunit of dynactin. Results from these studies lead to insights into how this interaction is regulated by the isoform type or phosphorylation state of dynein. The dynamic nature of this system makes it difficult to study by cryo-electron microscopy or X-ray crystallography. In addition, the complex has characteristics that make it unfavorable for study by conventional NMR methods. This project uses a combination of mutagenesis to stabilize p150Glued combined with better localization of the binding site to allow the development of smaller, more tractable constructs that are providing high-resolution structural information. This work helps to develop an understanding for how this system is regulated, which further complements studies on the less dynamic regions of the dynein complex. In the course of this research, new methods for protein NMR spectroscopy are developed to benefit not only researchers studying dynein and intrinsically disordered proteins, but the protein NMR community at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lasers and other light sources are tools with which one can probe, measure, and even control the behavior of molecules. In this project, new ways to interact light with molecules are designed by incorporating the wave properties of light such as phase and polarization. Although the interaction of a single small package (photon) of light with a molecule is quite well understood, multiple photons can be combined into pulses that influence molecules in new ways. These interactions of photons and molecules are best described by quantum mechanics, a the mathematical description of the motion and interaction of subatomic particles, incorporating the concepts of quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, etc. The methods developed in this project will provide new information within this framework. Success in this area could lead to new technologies such as quantum computers. To benchmark the predictions, the project includes extensive collaborations and student exchanges with leading experimental groups all over the world.<br/><br/>Professor Mukamel is developing methods to study the response of complex molecules to sequences of ultrafast optical laser pulses that provide a multidimensional view of electronic and vibrational dynamics and correlations. Experimental techniques involving novel pulse sequences are designed.  Theoretical and computational tools for their analysis are developed and broadly applied to molecules in the condensed phase. Models and practical computational tools are developed for the interpretation and analysis of these signals. Novel spectroscopic techniques, which make use of the quantum nature of light, photon entanglement and photon coincidence detection are explored. These provide additional tools for probing molecules and chromophore aggregates by providing information that is not accessible by classical light.

When there is abundant melting, this process looks like the formation of oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges.  However, in some magma poor margins, the continental crust stretches and thins by faulting and allows mantle to rise beneath the crust and be exposed to water penetrating down faults.  Combined with water, mantle forms a rock called serpentinite, rich in hydrated talc minerals and magnetite, a magnetic and electrically conductive mineral. It is important to understand more about the process of continental rifting but the seismic method, the most commonly used geophysical tool, has trouble differentiating between lower crustal rocks and serpentinized mantle.   Electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods allow the electrical conductivity of the crust and mantle to be imaged, and this project will use a combination of seismic methods and EM methods to study a magma poor margin southwest of the UK.  From this a better understanding of the fundamental tectonic, chemical, and thermal history of continental breakup will be gained.  The thermal history is important to the generation of hydrocarbons in this area.<br/><br/>The breakup of continents involves a complex interplay of extensional tectonics and magmatism. The final stages of this process, resulting in the initiation of seafloor spreading, remain poorly understood. One common end-member involves hyper-extended continental crust and broad regions of exhumed and serpentinized (hydrated) mantle. Serpentinization at mid-ocean ridges, rifted margins and subduction zones mediates geochemical exchange between the lithosphere and the hydrosphere. There is evidence that normal faulting plays a key role in supplying fluids driving serpentinization beneath hyper-extended continental crust and possibly in regions of exhumed mantle. However, the seismic P-wave velocities of mafic crustal rocks and of serpentinized mantle rocks are similar, so interpretations of seismic data are uncertain. Serpentinized mantle rocks are generally more conductive, often by about an order of magnitude, than mafic crustal rocks, so controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) and magnetotelluric (MT) techniques provide a promising route to resolve controversies around lithospheric structure.  This project will focus on the magma-poor Goban Spur rifted margin to (i) acquire coincident high-quality CSEM, MT, and wide-angle seismic datasets along two carefully chosen transects; (ii) use these data to obtain coincident high-resolution seismic velocity and resistivity models for the upper few kilometers of the lithosphere, and lower-resolution models to tens of kilometers depth; (iii) interpret the resulting models to quantify regional and local variations in mantle serpentinization and magmatic addition; (iv) reconcile these observations with numerical models of lithospheric extension, mantle hydration, and decompression melting as seafloor spreading is initiated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To develop a citizenry that will participate in this technological revolution, it is essential to develop learning experiences for K-12 learners on the foundations of AI literacy in order to adequately prepare the workforce of the future. Supporting the teaching of AI concepts in the K-12 curriculum requires integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines. This project will develop and implement technology-infused summer workshops for middle school students in grades 6-8 in the areas of computer vision and machine learning through a program called ImageSTEM. The program uses computational cameras to integrate computer science, math and design thinking in teaching visual AI concepts while also drawing inspiration from media arts to enhance science learning experiences. Learning technology modules to be developed include color and lighting for physics-based vision to understand the interface between the physical world and image sensing; image classification pipelines that teach the basics of visual feature extraction, machine learning classification, and the collection and training of data; and use of machine learning for synthetically-generated visual media. Underrepresented students, including predominantly Hispanic/Latino students from Phoenix, Arizona and African-American students from a rural area in Georgia, will gain understanding  and explore future careers in AI and STEM. The ImageSTEM program will disseminate knowledge and research findings on necessary skills and factors that underlie image-based visual AI technology for future STEM workforce development in industry, education, transportation, and healthcare. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>Researchers will investigate the design and deployment of computational camera technology into the science and math curriculum of grades 6-8.

To do so, the project will develop and test a written response concept inventory to measure undergraduate students? knowledge of complex Food-Energy-Water systems. Traditional concept inventories are widely used in many disciplines to measure student understanding of key ideas in the discipline.  These concept inventories use answers to multiple choice questions to measure student knowledge. However, greater insight into student thinking can be gained from questions that require students to use their own words to demonstrate their knowledge. This project plans to develop a ?Next Generation Concept Inventory? that will use short answer questions and automated scoring of student responses to questions about interdisciplinary, systems-level concepts. The availability of this concept inventory is expected to help faculty evaluate their students? understanding of complex environmental concepts, as well as evaluate and compare learning within and between programs. This information, in turn, can be used to improve teaching effectiveness within environmental programs and may serve as a model for similar approaches in other disciplines.<br/><br/>To better inform those who teach, make curricular decisions, and manage college-level environmental programs, the project will develop an assessment tool to measure environmental students? foundational knowledge and understanding of complex systems-level concepts.

To do so, the project will develop and test a written response concept inventory to measure undergraduate students? knowledge of complex Food-Energy-Water systems. Traditional concept inventories are widely used in many disciplines to measure student understanding of key ideas in the discipline.  These concept inventories use answers to multiple choice questions to measure student knowledge.

This project plans to develop a ?Next Generation Concept Inventory? that will use short answer questions and automated scoring of student responses to questions about interdisciplinary, systems-level concepts. The availability of this concept inventory is expected to help faculty evaluate their students? understanding of complex environmental concepts, as well as evaluate and compare learning within and between programs. This information, in turn, can be used to improve teaching effectiveness within environmental programs and may serve as a model for similar approaches in other disciplines.<br/><br/>To better inform those who teach, make curricular decisions, and manage college-level environmental programs, the project will develop an assessment tool to measure environmental students? foundational knowledge and understanding of complex systems-level concepts.

The project could lead to energy-efficient light-emitting materials.  The research is unique as dialing up or down the electrical energy input to the device could lead to the production of different colors.  This project lies at the interface of chemistry, materials, and physics and is therefore well suited to the education of well-informed scientists.  Outreach activities include developing a course on the chemistry and physics of light that targets upper-class undergraduate students and early graduate students in STEM disciplines. The new course aims to enhance the students' understanding of light-involved science and technologies, which is and will be at the forefront of the efforts to improve the well-being, and satisfying the curiosity, of society with contributions to a vast range of areas from energy sectors to space exploration.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, this project aims to provide structural models to produce excitation-dependent dual-emitting fluorophores, including one class that has the potential to undergo thermally-activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).

The era of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy started on 2017 August 17, when LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) discovered an event dubbed GW170817. This was the very first direct observation of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star in-spiral, which was accompanied by the detection of light at all wavelengths. The multi-messenger observations of GW170817 have crucially informed a large variety of fields including gravitational physics, nuclear physics, cosmology, and relativistic astrophysics. In spite of the spectacular progress, several questions remain open. A key one is whether the stellar object leftover from the merger is a short-lived neutron star, a long-lived neutron star, or a promptly formed black hole. This award supports searches of LIGO data for signatures aimed at uncovering the nature of the merger remnant. Studying how the nature of the remnant depends on the properties of the merging objects can unlock the fundamental physics of matter at densities much larger than those that can be probed in Earth-based laboratories and clarify the physics of some of the most exotic objects in the stellar graveyard. This project also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students who will constitute the next generation of scientists, and several outreach activities aimed at presenting LIGO results to the general public and K12 students. <br/><br/>Specific intellectual goals are: (i) Unmasking the remnants of compact object mergers accompanied by gamma-ray bursts by carrying out searches for gravitational waves from newly formed neutron stars; (ii) Assessing the efficiency of the newly-developed Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA) in detecting the full zoo of possible gravitational wave signals from merger remnants, and its efficacy in post-detection parameter estimation; (iii) Quantifying the potential for discovery of gravitational waves from neutron stars formed in long gamma-ray bursts by future upgraded gravitational wave detectors. Broader impact goals are: (i) Bringing age-appropriate presentations and LIGO-related outreach activities to under-represented groups by leveraging the TTU Honors College-Bayless Elementary School mentoring program; (ii) Presenting a LIGO prize to the South Plains Regional Science Fair; (iii) Presenting LIGO results to the general public during the Astronight at TTU.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The region has hosted several large mega-thrust earthquakes, has a lot of volcanic activity, and  has the potential of generating a tsunami. The region is also an ideal natural laboratory to study subduction systems due to the long-term subduction of the Pacific Plate, volcanism associated with subduction that builds the Aleutian Islands, and high earthquake activity. This project will examine the mantle processes that drive subduction using both onshore and offshore earthquake data. Mantle deformation will be examined within the different portions of the subduction system. The techniques to be used are complementary and when combined will provide a full picture of the subduction zone region. This integrated view will allow an investigation of the operation and interactions of the different subduction regions to create the Alaska-Aleutians subduction zone that is seen today. This project will bring an undergraduate student to the University of Delaware for a summer research experience internship and will provide training for a doctoral student. This project also will include collaborative outreach activities with the University of Delaware Disaster Research Center.   <br/><br/>This project is a multi-faceted examination of seismic anisotropy throughout the Alaska-Aleutians subduction zone (AASZ). Multiple datasets and techniques will be used in sequence to gain insights into the interactions of the different parts of the subduction system. Shear wave splitting analyses will be performed on a variety of seismic phases that are each tailored to best assess a portion of the AASZ: 1) local-S splitting at island arc stations that target the mantle wedge, 2) source-side splitting in geometries that isolate deformation within the downgoing slab, 3) source-side splitting that targets dynamics in the sub-slab mantle, and 4) traditional splitting at the ocean-bottom and onland stations. Each set of splitting observations targets a specific subduction zone region, with associated targeted questions, in such a way as to be easily integrated together. Combining the suite of complementary techniques will create a complete view of the deformation and active dynamics leading to the modern day AASZ. These results will refine the understanding of slab deformation in the mantle, the association of mantle wedge dynamics and along strike variations in arc magmatism, and the overall evolution of mantle flow beneath the Pacific as it morphs from a surface plate into a subducting slab.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A prime example is the theory of General Relativity, which was invented to make gravity compatible with Special Relativity. The Einstein equations are a system of evolution equations that describe the spacetime geometry and curvature, which arise in specific situations. Like many other geometric/physical equations the Einstein equations are nonlinear and thus can produce solutions that develop very high curvature regions and lead to mathematical singularities, which are expected to be black holes. Singularities also arise in surfaces that minimize volume, so called minimal surfaces. Such minimizing surfaces in a curved spacetime are intimately connected with the geometric structure of the spacetime, and their existence and properties reflect properties of the spacetime such as the energy distribution of the gravitational field, and the prediction of gravitational collapse to a black hole. A major goal of this project is to better understand the stability properties of such singularities, especially those that can arise in volume minimizing surfaces in spacetime. When we study curved geometries, there are naturally associated numbers that are the fundamental frequencies with which such a geometry would vibrate if it were thought of as an idealized drumhead. This sequence of numbers is called the spectrum. A second goal of this project is to understand the special geometries that have the largest fundamental frequencies per unit volume.  The project also includes significant training of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows.  The PI also plans to deliver outreach lectures in geometry.<br/><br/>The focus of this research is in the areas of differential geometry, general relativity, and partial differential equations. In work that is motivated both by differential geometry and general relativity the PI will study the singularities, which may form in higher dimensional volume minimizing hypersurfaces. This issue comes up in the study of manifolds of positive scalar curvature and the related positive mass theorem of general relativity. He will study the question of whether singularities can be perturbed away by a small perturbation of the boundary or the ambient metric. He poses some explicit test cases for this question. The second main theme is the study and comparison of three quasi-local masses that have arisen in general relativity. These are the Hawking, Bartnik, and Brown-York masses. Several questions are posed concerning the relative sizes of these quantities. The connections between the Brown-York mass and recent polyhedral comparison theorems will be investigated with a suggestion for solidifying the connections between the two. The third main theme of his research in geometry will be the study of spectral geometry and related questions on minimal submanifolds. The PI has recently analyzed sharp bounds on the high Steklov eigenvalues of the disk and will extend that study to the next simplest cases of the annulus and the Mobius band. Finally he plans to investigate the equivariant eigenvalue maximization problem for surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Oceans and coastal ecosystems are major sinks for plastic pollution. Plastics have been shown to accumulate in and negatively impact the health of marine life, which in turn places added stress on ecosystems as well as marine industries reliant on the health of these ecosystems. The ultimate fate and adverse impacts of these small plastic particles depends on how they interact and are transported in nature. A critical natural component of oceans and a point of initial exposure to plastic pollution are sea surface microlayers, which are ubiquitous globally and are comprised of natural molecules, particulate matter, and microorganisms. These microlayers act as an ?ocean skin? that influences the exchange of mass and heat between the seawater and the atmosphere. They are also sites for microplastic and nano plastic accumulation. This project will study how microplastics and nano plastics interact with model sea surface microlayers, how these interactions cause them to accumulate and transform at the sea surface, and to what extent microplastics and nano plastics will alter the properties of sea surface microlayers. The goal is to provide fundamental insight into interfacial and colloidal properties leading to microplastic and nano plastic accumulation that can contribute broadly to determining environmental risks of plastic pollution and to devising strategies for remediation. Participation will be broadened by partnering with the Northeast NSF Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program to provide research experiences to two supported underrepresented students. These students will also lead a new middle school outreach activity. <br/><br/><br/>Sea surface microlayers, which range from 1 to 1000 micrometers thick, are ubiquitous globally on ocean and coastal waters, regulating the exchange of mass and energy between these waters and the atmosphere. Sea surface microlayers are also a site of accumulation for heavy metal, organic, and particulate pollutants including micro- and nano-plastics. This project is motivated by the following needs: Representative and commercially relevant micro- and nano-plastics enabling laboratory studies, suitable microlayer systems that are broadly applicable and enable actionable results relating to fate, transport, and nanoscale interactions, and microscopy techniques needed to characterize sea surface microlayers containing particulate matter. Well-characterized and size-fractionated model micro- and nano-plastics will be created by mechanical and UV degradation (Aim 1). Phytoplankton sea surface microlayers will be prepared in a modified Langmuir trough (Aim 2) and used to quantify the accumulation and transformation of micro- and nano-plastics as a function of their physical properties and composition (Aim 3). To realize the broader impact of the project to education, outreach, and diversity and inclusion, underrepresented students will be engaged in research activities and a new middle-school outreach initiative will be created. Marine plastics provide a versatile and timely platform to engage students in STEM activities. The transformative aspects of this work derive from the limited understanding of the role of the sea surface microlayers in micro- and nano-plastic accumulation and include identifying currently unknown mechanisms of interaction and transformation, demonstrating the ability to utilize complex field samples to study micro- and nano-particle interactions with bio-environmental interfaces, and creating a new experimental framework that can be broadly applied to different ocean and coastal regions.

Learning technology modules to be developed include color and lighting for physics-based vision to understand the interface between the physical world and image sensing; image classification pipelines that teach the basics of visual feature extraction, machine learning classification, and the collection and training of data; and use of machine learning for synthetically-generated visual media. Underrepresented students, including predominantly Hispanic/Latino students from Phoenix, Arizona and African-American students from a rural area in Georgia, will gain understanding  and explore future careers in AI and STEM. The ImageSTEM program will disseminate knowledge and research findings on necessary skills and factors that underlie image-based visual AI technology for future STEM workforce development in industry, education, transportation, and healthcare. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>Researchers will investigate the design and deployment of computational camera technology into the science and math curriculum of grades 6-8. Project objectives include (1) conducting six workshops across the two collaborating institutions of Arizona State University and the University of Georgia, co-creating the curricular material for the workshops alongside 36 middle school teachers, (2) deploying and testing in both the on-site workshops as well as in teachers? classrooms during the academic school year, (3) gathering evidence to advance and deepen the field's understanding of students' development of computer science knowledge and practices in the areas of computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and (4) assessing the impact of these experiences on the adoption and strengthening of STEM identities of teachers and students during the year after participation in the workshops. Research into the cognitive skills, scientific identity, and workforce development will be conducted for teachers and students participating in the ImageSTEM program using a mixed-methods approach. Affect control theory-based survey instruments, semi-structured interviews, teacher reflections, and researcher observations will be used to assess changes in STEM identities and STEM educational and career aspirations. The project outcomes include deployment of the workshop lessons into the middle school curriculum by teachers during the academic year, and contributions to teachers? knowledge of visual AI technology, and how students learn and engage in problem-solving activities through visual AI applications. The project team will disseminate learning modules based on findings in the workshops and research activities through online and multimedia formats to the broader community of schools and teachers for greater impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The laws of nature are often expressed as differential equations and these fall into several broad categories.  The classical heat equation is one prototype; it describes the evolution of temperature in space over time. This and similar equations play a central role in diverse fields, such as physics, economics, information theory, engineering and mathematics.  One of the fundamental principles of the heat equation is diffusion: heat spreads out over time as the temperature becomes more and more constant.  In the classical heat equation, the heat particles move independently and do not interact. When the particles interact with each other, then the situation becomes much more complicated and the evolution is governed by a nonlinear partial differential equation.  This is seen in many geometric problems, such as the evolution of interfaces where the governing principle is a nonlinear version of the heat equation. The equations describing the evolution of interfaces is known as mean curvature flow; it was initially studied in material science and now plays a role in many areas of science, engineering and mathematics.  In addition to the research component of this proposal the project also will also train students: the PI is currently advising several PhD students as well as working with an advanced undergraduate student.  The PI is writing books on research topics of current interest based on graduate courses (on the heat equation and on the mean curvature flow) with his colleague Toby Colding.  The PI serves on the editorial board of eight highly regarded mathematics journals, including the Annals of Mathematics.  The PI is also working on curriculum reform at his home institution, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>The project attacks fundamental questions on geometric flows, including properties of singularities and dynamical properties of the flow.  In mean curvature flow (MCF), a sub-manifold evolves over time to decrease its area as efficiently as possible, pulling itself tight.  Over time, the non-linearity dominates and singularities develop.  The key is to understand these singularities.  Most of the progress has been for hyper-surfaces where the flow can be expressed as a single equation.  In higher co-dimension, the flow is a complicated system of interacting equations and much less is known.  This project focuses on fundamental questions in higher co-dimension MCF: <br/>1. Which singularities are generic and which can be perturbed away?<br/>2. What are the dynamics of the flow near a singularity?<br/>3. What does the flow look like near a singularity?  Is the blow up unique?<br/>4. When are singularities isolated?<br/>These are absolutely fundamental questions and progress will have significant implications.  One of the key tools is the subtle interplay between function theory and geometry.  Many of the techniques developed apply to a broader class of systems, including Ricci flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability of a protein monomer to become a part of a higher-order assembly is essential to biology, but to date, we still have only a limited understanding of how complex protein assemblies have evolved from simple monomers.  A well-known protein is human hemoglobin, a tetramer which is precisely tuned for oxygen transport.  With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in Chemistry is funding Dr. Juliette Lecomte of Johns Hopkins University to explore the modifications necessary to transform monomeric hemoglobins into dimeric assemblies endowed with new chemical properties.  The hemoglobins that will be at the focus of the study are from unicellular organisms and artificial proteins with enhanced thermal resistance.  The research applies a combined computational and experimental approach to the study of the hemoglobins.  The university-level students who conduct the research become versed in the use of biophysical methods.  An additional effort is directed to the integration of the results of the research into undergraduate courses in biochemistry and biophysical chemistry. High-school students from Baltimore City and surrounding areas are engaged by Dr. Lecomte and her students in scientific investigation during outreach activities.<br/><br/>Truncated hemoglobins (TrHbs) are small proteins endowed with enzymatic activity related to the processing of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.  Some TrHbs adopt or sample a multimeric state in aqueous solution, suggesting a transition to an assembly with cooperative ligand binding properties.  The focus of the research is the analysis and design of such multimeric states.  Starting points are natural sequences from the piezophile Shewanella benthica and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and artificial hyperstable sequences derived from multiple sequence alignments.  Electronic absorption and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies are used to inspect nascent dimeric properties and the consequences of subunit association for ligand binding.

RiverMorph will also support management of current and future issues related to the nation?s water resources. The data and tools developed for RiverMorph will create digital representations of three-dimensional river morphological structures of most U.S. rivers, which can support fundamental research and practical needs related to stream rehabilitation, infrastructure design, and food risk mitigation.

The prototype RiverMorph resource will be developed by carefully assessing the availability and accessibility of river data and the needs of potential stakeholders. The usability and adaptability of RiverMorph will be demonstrated through specific science test cases that will address the following research questions: 1) How does channel morphology change over decadal time scales, and how can the underlying processes be modeled to assist with water resources engineering and management decisions? 2) How can river geometry be best described across spatial scales ranging from low order single streams to large stream networks for accurately simulating river hydrodynamics and flooding? 3) How can data-driven approaches improve the understanding of streamwise and river-floodplain-watershed connectivity for supporting modeling approaches over large spatio-temporal scales?

In string theory, a branch of theoretical physics, algebraic varieties are used to describe fine pieces of our universe. In this theory, everything is made of tiny strings which travel through spacetime, and trace out algebraic curves in some algebraic varieties. Gromov-Witten invariants, originating from physics, are virtual counts of algebraic curves in algebraic varieties satisfying prescribed incidence constraints. They are used in physic to describe the structures of our universe. They also provide new approaches and insights to classical problems from algebraic geometry. Despite their importance, these invariants are very difficult to compute. The primary goal of this project is to develop a new method to calculate Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the boundary of the gauged linear sigma model from physics using tools of logarithmic structures from algebraic geometry. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project focuses on studying the geometry of the gauged linear sigma model (GLSM) using stable log maps of Abramovich-Chen-Gross-Siebert. The GLSM proposed by Witten in the 1990s can be viewed as a deep generalization of the hyper-plane property of Gromov-Witten invariants in all genus. However, the moduli stacks in GLSM which carry the perfect obstruction theory for defining GLSM invariants are in general non-proper. This presents a major difficulty in calculating GLSM invariants. Recently, log compactifications of hybrid-type GLSM were constructed by Chen, Janda, and Ruan using stable log maps. These compactifications provide proper moduli stacks carrying a reduced perfect obstruction theory whose associated virtual cycles recover the GLSM virtual cycles. This project is an integrated study aiming at a new computational method for calculating Gromov-Witten invariants by investigating the structures of the virtual cycles of these log compactifications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to create a new data mining engine embedded at the vehicle level to collect and process the streams of data in a highly efficient and scalable way. Harnessing novel data science tools, this project will address important fundamental questions of how to efficiently decide what information to collect, what to filter, and what to process within a vehicle. In turn, having an efficient in-vehicle data collection engine will improve our capabilities to build a high-impact cyberinfrastructure for connected vehicles. This cyberinfrastructure will open up new research capabilities and provide social benefits in the fields of intelligent transportation and smart cities. The data will tell us how to improve traffic congestion, how to create safer streets, and how to better design our cities, resulting in improved mobility, economic improvements, and lives being saved.

Faster algorithms will both accelerate computations that can already be performed, and enable computations that are beyond the reach of existing methods. More energy efficient algorithms will help to reduce the power consumption of data centers, and to extend the battery life of mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers. The fundamental innovation behind our approach is to harness mathematical properties of large collections of random numbers to build new stochastic algorithms that dramatically outperform existing deterministic ones. In a nutshell, the idea is to use randomized sampling, and randomized averaging, to reduce the effective dimensionality of the problems to be processed. In addition the project provides research training opportunities for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.<br/><br/>We seek to develop computationally efficient methods for solving linear systems of equations involving large numbers of variables, both in terms of asymptotic complexity, and in terms of practical speed at realistic problem sizes. Such systems of equations arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, and solving them is often the bottleneck in terms of time that decides how large of a problem can be handled. In particular, this is what limits how large of a data set can be analyzed, or how realistic a computational simulation can be when modelling some physical phenomenon. By developing faster and more efficient algorithms, we will accelerate computations that are done today, and enable many others that are outside the reach of currently existing methods.  The project is premised on the recent development of new randomized algorithms for solving linear algebraic problems. Such methods have proven to dramatically outperform classical deterministic methods for certain tasks such as computing low rank factorizations to matrices - the crucial computational step in e.g. Principal Component Analysis, the PageRank algorithm by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, numerical coarse graining when modeling complex multiscale systems, and many more. Randomized algorithms have also been used to build faster solvers for linear systems. However, while the theoretical results obtained at this point are extremely encouraging, it remains to develop randomized linear solvers that are decisively faster in practical applications. To achieve this goal, the project will support a research group that brings together four researchers with complementary skills in numerical linear algebra, random matrix theory, computational harmonic analysis, optimization, and high performance computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, linear algebra operations on dense matrices have served as the backbone of high-performance scientific computing applications. This research aims to translate this benefit to more complex problems, by improving software infrastructure and parallel performance of sparse matrix and tensor operations. The proposed methods will be applied to accelerate analysis of large graphs, approximation of multidimensional datasets by tensor decompositions, and simulation of quantum systems. By providing a high-level library for distributed sparse tensors, the research will improve the development productivity of scientists and engineers from disciplines including chemistry, physics, and bioinformatics. Deployment of tensor-based techniques on massively-parallel computing systems will enable simulations of larger scale and higher accuracy, making new innovations in computational science possible. Additionally, development of web-based educational modules for programming with tensors and understanding parallel performance will make the software and methods accessible to the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>Tensor decompositions and tensor networks are fundamental techniques in approximation of multi-dimensional data and functions. The frontiers of tensor computations in quantum chemistry and data analysis involve methods that contract tensors of different order, size, and sparsity. Recent developments have led to provably efficient algorithms and software for contraction of a pair of dense tensors and multiplication of a pair of sparse matrices. However, in the context of sparse multi-tensor operations, opportunities for asymptotic cost improvements remain. In particular, there is a lack of software and rigorous algorithmic analysis for sparse matrix and tensor computations involving hyper-sparsity and output sparsity, as well as for all-at-once contraction of multiple tensors, which can be advantageous in the presence of sparsity. Further, at the software library level, open problems remain in leveraging layout persistence, reuse of mapping logic, and automated performance modeling. The project will address these gaps in the state-of-the-art of available computational infrastructure by developing new parallel algorithms and systems techniques for sparse multi-tensor contraction.

Sintim and Uma Aryal, from Purdue University, West Lafayette, to determine the details of how various molecular components of viruses and bacteria activate immune cells to cause inflammation. Immune cells play important roles in eliminating tumors and also protecting organisms against invading pathogenic bacteria and viruses. A new pathway or signaling was recently discovered in immune cells, which sense molecules called cyclic dinucleotides to control inflammation response. This project uses chemical probes and proteomics to discover proteins that bind cyclic dinucleotides in order to regulate signaling in immune cells. In addition, this research increases workforce capacity in STEM by training graduate students and advanced undergraduates to acquire a diverse set of specialized skills in chemical synthesis, mass spectrometry, immunology and molecular biology methods. <br/><br/>Cyclic dinucleotides, such as cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate, cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate?adenosine monophosphate, are known to signal via a stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-controlled innate immune pathway and play major roles in a wide variety of human diseases including various cancers, viral and bacterial infections as well as autoimmune diseases. Thus far, the cyclic dinucleotide-STING-TBK1 axis is well characterized, but other pathways and/or protein targets that cyclic dinucleotides also affect are poorly characterized. Understanding how cyclic dinucleotides regulate host cells physiology could provide valuable insights into key determinants that shape the host-pathogen interaction. The principal investigators use various STING-axis knockout cell lines and proteomics to uncover cyclic dinucleotide mediated pathways that channel through STING and non-STING pathways. They also globally profile post-translational modifications of proteins in the presence of cyclic dinucleotide signals. Using novel chemical probes, the investigators uncover mammalian proteins that bind to cyclic dinucleotides or associate with STING.

It is an integral component of cartilage, where it plays a biomechanical role in promoting healthy joint function. Further, since it can be obtained in large quantities, and can be chemically modified, it has become widely studied for biomedical and biomaterial applications. These biological and technological roles rely on hyaluronic acid?s physical features: it is a long, linear polymer that is highly charged and water soluble, and it has a variety of interactions, both with salt ions and with biomolecular binding partners, that modify its structure and behavior. However, compared to other biopolymers (such as DNA or cytoskeletal components), the basic physical behavior of hyaluronic acid has not been extensively studied.<br/>The main goal of the present project is to perform precision measurements of the physical behavior of hyaluronic acid, and its modification by ions and other molecules. The researchers will carry out such experiments using modern biophysical approaches, and interpret them using advanced theoretical methods. Experiments will be focused on two areas: first, researchers will quantify electrostatic effects of salt on hyaluronic acid behavior, and particularly pursue understanding of physiologically-relevant mixed-salt conditions on molecular shape. Second, researchers will investigate the hypothesis that dramatic shape-changes can be induced in hyaluronic acid upon binding to specific biomolecular partners. <br/>Overall, the scientific work in this project will result in direct, quantitative estimates of the role of salt and biomolecular-binding in affecting hyaluronic acid behavior; in turn, this will lead to better understanding of the molecule?s various biological roles, and will permit rational engineering of hyaluronic acid in biomaterials environments. These scientific impacts are complemented by a range of other benefits, notably including a major effort to broaden graduate-student training through an exchange program with a German university, focused on teaching modern computational methods to bioengineers and biophysicists. Other benefits will accrue from collaboration with a national lab, and enhancing STEM human resources through undergraduate student training.<br/>?<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Hyaluronic acid, HA, is a long, linear, negatively-charged polysaccharide with moderate conformational flexibility. It plays broad biological roles, particularly in defining the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of extracellular spaces. HA?s properties have also led to broad investigation of its use as a synthetic biomaterial, e.g. forming injectables or cell/tissue growth substrates. The polymeric properties of HA underlie these biological and biotechnological roles, but are understudied. The overarching goal of this proposal is to fill that gap in knowledge by performing high-resolution physical measurements, supported by advanced theoretical interpretation methods, of ion- and ligand-induced HA conformational behaviors. The researchers will apply a unique single-molecule mechanics instrument to carry out precision measurements of HA?s solution-mediated conformational and mechanical properties. Specific goals include 1) exploiting machine-learning methods to improve instrument capabilities in screening biomolecular elasticity; 2) validating and exploring a recent finding that HA conformation in mixed-ionic conditions is dominated by an ?ion jacket? that screens the effect of bulk salt concentration; and 3) studying the effects of specific biological ligands on HA conformation, with a focus on ligands posited to induce a helix/coil transition in the chain, and those that cause global chain swelling. Experimental results will be interpreted with reference to analytical theories of solution electrostatics and polymer bottle-brush behavior, as well as coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether trees thrive or falter during drought depends on how they respond to these stressful conditions. Despite many studies of leaf-level changes to photosynthesis and water use during drought, it is still unclear how trees make integrated and coordinated changes at the scale of the entire plant. For example, trees that change the angles of their leaves can reduce the radiation load at different levels of the canopy, reducing heat stress and water loss. This study investigates the coordinated adjustments of tree canopy structure and physiology under water stress using drought experiments in both growth chambers and in a forest that has a rainfall removal experiment. The investigators bring together traditional measurements of leaf and canopy gas exchange with novel remote sensing techniques that measure canopy structure and physiology. This project will provide interdisciplinary teaching, training, and learning experiences by collaborating with a non-profit organization (Math4Science) that promotes STEM, creating videos of 3D forests, mentoring undergraduate students, and exposing K-12 students from under-represented groups to STEM research.<br/><br/>The degree to which forests will continue to serve as carbon sinks and mitigate climate change hinges on whether trees can make physiological and structural adjustments to cope with changing environmental stressors. Most research to date on tree responses to drought has focused on how trees alter leaf-level physiology, phenology, and carbon mobilization and allocation. However, trees also make structural adjustments in response to drought (e.g., by changing leaf angles) to reduce radiation load and leaf temperature. The work extends current research on plant water use strategies, which is mostly focused on physiological responses at the leaf or ecosystem scales, to a new dimension - canopy structure (leaf angles). The investigators aim to answer the question ""To what extent do trees respond to water stress through coordinated adjustments of canopy structure and leaf physiology, and by what mechanisms?"" combining measurements of leaf and canopy gas exchange with novel remote sensing techniques that measure canopy structure and leaf physiology, including the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and the Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV). By taking advantage of both classical and novel techniques, this project will provide new insights into the coordination of plant response to water stress over spatial (leaf to canopy) and temporal scales (short to long term). Including mechanical responses in physiological studies of drought at the scales of entire tree crowns will provide novel mechanistic insights into drought-science and will facilitate building comprehensive mechanistic approaches into ecosystem-scale models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are known to behave like an ultra-lightweight gas of artificial atoms, combining the properties of both light and massive particles.  It was shown that at low temperatures these quasi-particles condense to a collective quantum ground state known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this project, new methods will be developed to transform the coherent polariton quantum fluid into a fluid of dipolar exciton. These dipolar excitons are long-lived and strongly interacting atom-like particles in a semiconductor, featuring rich many-body physics phenomena that have just begun to be understood. The ability to perform transformations between two very different types of quantum fluids, one which is strongly admixed with light and weakly interacting, and one which is much more matter-like and strongly interacting, will allow integrating the different, complementary features of each of the fluids, and will open up a wide range of new ways to manipulate quantum fluids of matter and of light in semiconductors.

Since antiquity, mathematicians have studied surfaces such as spheres, ellipsoids, paraboloids and hyperboloids in three-dimensional Euclidean space. These surfaces, familiar to the Greeks, can all be described in Cartesian geometry by equations of the second degree. Modern algebraic geometry, as developed primarily in the 20th and 21st centuries, provides tools to study surfaces defined by equations of higher degree. While a single equation of degree five (for example) may define a smooth surface in three-space, a pair of such equations will define a pair of surfaces, and the intersection of the two surfaces will be a curve in space. The project will seek to answer long-standing questions about the possible singularities of a curve arising in this way, using tools that first arose in the description of the fundamental forces of nature at the atomic and nuclear scale. These same tools will also be used in addressing questions about network flows. At the same time, the project will train graduate students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.<br/><br/>The project activity will be in the following specific areas. In collaboration with T. S. Mrowka, the PI will develop properties of an instanton homology for spatial trivalent graphs and for knots in general three-manifolds. In particular, tools will be developed that will enable the calculation of instanton homology more generally than is currently possible. This instanton homology was constructed in previous work using a gauge theory related to representations of the fundamental group of complement of the knot or graph in the group of rotations, SO(3). When defined using a local coefficient system, instanton homology of knots and links yields new constraints on the topology of embedded surfaces whose boundary is a given knot or link. Specifically, it yields information about the possible genus of such surfaces and the number of their singularities. The final goal is to develop these tools to the point where they will answer long-standing questions in algebraic geometry concerning the topology of algebraic curves. For example, the PI will seek a negative answer to the question of whether two smooth quintic surfaces can intersect in an irreducible singular curve of genus zero.

These quantum dots are efficient light absorbers and potentially useful for devices such as solar cells or light emitting diodes. In a device, quantum dots must be closely packed together in order to facilitate energy transfer from one quantum dot to the next. As a result, the distance between quantum dots and the speed at which energy migrates has a strong effect on device efficiency. By imaging how energy moves in quantum dot solids with different packings, this research aims to provide guidelines for designing structures for efficient light energy harvesting through control of energy migration rates. To achieve these goals, synthetic strategies are developed to control the size of the quantum dots and the chemical linkers used to connect them. Then, these quantum dots are used as ?artificial atoms? and assembled into well-ordered structures known as superlattices. The research team also develops microscopy techniques to record fast energy transfer events with a resolution of 10 femtoseconds (a femtosecond is one quadrillionth of a second) and to image energy migration distances with a resolution of 50 nanometers (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter).  The research and educational activities are integrated to educate the next generation of solar energy researchers through K-12, undergraduate, and graduate science education.

Results from this project are utilized to educate the general public on new solar energy technologies using podcast and video media.<br/><br/>Long-range exciton transport and coherence in colloidal quantum dot solids are highly desirable for their optoelectronic and quantum information applications. However, exciton transport in colloidal quantum dot solids thus far has been almost exclusively realized in the incoherent regime with excitons localized in individual quantum dots due to the relatively large energetic disorder compared to the electronic coupling strength in these systems. Incoherent transport of localized excitons presents a major limitation in obtaining long-range coherence and transport. In this project, strong dipole-dipole interactions between perovskite quantum dots are leveraged to enhance transport by promoting coherent motion of delocalized excitons. The team elucidates transport mechanisms by employing ultrafast coherent microscopy with ~10 fs time resolution and better than 50 nm spatial resolution. Exciton propagation distance, delocalization length, and coherent transport contributions are measured as a function of temperature. The extent of exciton delocalization is systematically controlled by varying inter-particle distance, electronic coupling, and dimensionality using ligand chemistry. The project provides guidelines for designing excitonic materials using perovskite quantum dots as building blocks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This belief is implicated in lowering girls? sense of their own STEM abilities, their feelings of belonging in STEM classes, and their interest in pursuing further education in STEM fields. The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, the University of Texas, Austin, and New York University is to answer important questions about how to teach genetics at the high school level in a manner that is scientifically accurate, but does not have these detrimental side effects. Specifically, this new line of experimental research will identify?and revise?the content in common genetics instruction that promotes the belief in neurogenetic essentialism. The proposed experiments will also explore how the beliefs of peers and teachers contribute to changes in such beliefs in students. This work has further implications for how the topic of differences between men and women is addressed during high school biology education. Furthermore, the research findings will advance theory on factors that contribute to gender disparities in STEM attitudes and aspirations.

Examples include the equations for fluid flows or the equation describing the distribution of stress in various structures. In practice, the equations are often solved with the use of computers and a good theoretical understanding of the equations is important for finding effective algorithms. At present, our theoretical understanding of many PDEs is incomplete. There is an important difference between linear models (for which our understanding is better) and non-linear models. In linear models, the reaction of the system to a disturbance is, roughly speaking, proportional to the disturbance. In non-linear models, this is not the case, and many of the mathematical difficulties can be traced to this effect. Linear regimes are often relevant for small disturbances from equilibria, whereas large disturbances are often governed by non-linear phenomena. This project will focus on the non-linear phenomena. In particular, one of the most serious effects in the class of equations which will be investigated is the formation of singularities and the related loss of predictive power of the equations. This will be studied in the context of fundamental equations (such as the equations of incompressible fluid mechanics) and also for various model equations, which can provide suitable stepping stones towards making progress on difficult open problems. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the project focuses on the following areas: (i) One-dimensional models exhibiting features of PDEs of fluid mechanics. These include the De Gregorio model (which can be thought of as an extension of the Constantin-Lax-Majda model), equations modeling boundary behavior of 2d systems, and vector-valued Burgers-type equations. In spite of their simplicity, such models can be a good source of ideas and their improved understanding can lead to progress on the fundamental equations. In fact, ideas going back to these models have already proved important in the context of the full three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations; (ii) Equations arising in physics and geometry for which we have a satisfactory chance of obtaining a fairly good understanding. These include the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, the 2d harmonic map heat flow, and some classical non-linear elliptic systems arising from multi-dimensional variational integrals for vector-valued functions. (The last theme has connections to non-linear elasticity.) All these are important equations in their own right and the PI believes that some of the long-standing open problems related to them can be successfully addressed; (iii) Approachable aspects of the full equations of the incompressible fluid dynamics (the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations). This includes investigations of the solvability of equations describing generalized self-similar singularities, relations between possible non-uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf solutions and questions about instabilities, the stability of the double exponential growth for 2d Euler near the boundaries, and other issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through scavenging radio energy from the surrounding environment, the radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting device can run semi-perpetually without a battery replacement. The energy harvesting feature, however, raises unique vulnerabilities in RF energy harvesting wireless networks. The investigator identifies a radically new threat model, called malicious energy attack: the adversary energy source threatens the information security by intentionally charging specific nodes to manipulate routing paths in the network layer. This project explores the non-linearity in energy harvesting systems and investigates reinforcement learning-enabled energy attack and defense mechanisms. It aims to develop efficient and secure communications for RF energy harvesting wireless networks. The project is expected to support development of sustainable and secure wireless networks, thereby leading to a broad impact on industrial sectors relying on energy harvesting techniques. The material generated from this project will be integrated into multiple courses on computer security and wireless networks.<br/> <br/>This project is organized around two research topics. The first topic develops offline and online optimal data transmission strategies based on a new nonlinear recursive energy harvesting model that considers the energy clamp phenomenon caused by dynamic RF environment, the nonlinear charging of the battery, and the nonlinear harvesting circuits. The second topic proposes a reinforcement learning-enabled intelligent energy attack method, where the adversary energy source can intelligently charge and control the energy level of each infected node based on the partial information of the traffic distribution in the network.

However, current quantum computers based on superconductors, ions, or atoms are prone to error due to imperfections. The solution to this grand challenge is to use new, engineered materials which are inherently immune to these imperfections. However, key questions remain regarding how to make a material that integrates the demanding properties needed to achieve superior performance in a technologically relevant manner. The principal investigators have created a new method to make ultra-thin metals, and this project focuses on understanding the microscopic properties of such metals, specifically bismuth and lead. The investigators will evaluate the impact of thinning these materials down to just a few atoms thick to explore how their properties change when they are manipulated at the atomic-scale. Beyond the scientific impact, this collaborative project will provide interdisciplinary research training for underrepresented graduate students, to broaden participation in science and engineering programs. The project will also develop a unique industry/university consortium to impart the importance of safety in industrial and research settings. This will not only better train future scientists for post-graduate careers in industry, but will also improve safety preparedness in academia.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The creation of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) by reducing the dimensionality of a topological insulator from 3D to 2D could provide a unique, robust route to achieving topological superconductivity. This project will investigate the atomic-scale physical, chemical and electronic properties of 2D bismuth (Bi) and lead (Pb). Lead and bismuth exhibit very strong spin-orbit interactions, and exceptionally robust and easily accessible topological insulator properties that may enable the design of groundbreaking electronic devices with dissipationless spin currents, and the realization of Majorana bound states. Furthermore, these elements exhibit unconventional superconductivity, and could be combined with ferromagnetic materials, suggesting the possibility of creating a Pb-based topological superconductor. The investigators enable the study by synthesizing atomically thin, two-dimensional forms of these materials prepared via confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) ? a novel intercalation process that stabilizes 2D forms of 3D materials developed by the PIs. The SiC/graphene interface passivation is investigated before, during and after synthesis to understand how interface reconstruction can enable in-situ removal of the graphene cap for direct characterization access to the 2D-Bi and Pb.  Additionally, removing the graphene cap enables direct functionalization of the 2D metal to explore how modifying the surfaces of 2D-Bi and Pb changes their underlying physical properties, including bonding and electronic character. Finally, the project is developing a mechanistic understanding of how the structure and interfacial interactions with SiC and graphene impact electronic structure of 2D-Bi and 2D-Pb and elucidate how they differ from thin films deposited by traditional methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decades of study on subduction zones have provided insight into the overarching processes that produce the magmas erupted, how the erupted magmas are produced at individual volcanoes, and a number of related questions. Despite this progress, a complex and largely unsolved problem is the cause of ubiquitous and dramatic variations in the amount and composition of magmas that erupt at volcanoes within the same subduction zone. Do these reflect processes acting deep within the Earth?s mantle, or in the overlying crust? Addressing this problem has important implications for understanding magma production and volcanic hazards, as worldwide almost a billion people live at risk from volcanoes. There is also a potential for scientific breakthrough by utilizing the existing large data sets acquired from recent NSF investments such as the MARGINS, GeoPRISMS, and EarthScope programs. However, addressing the question has proven challenging to date in part because of a lack of critical data for some locations, but largely because of the lack of suitable tools and approaches that allow us to quantitatively synthesize and compare the existing large data sets. <br/><br/>Thus, this is a multidisciplinary study to conduct a quantitative comparison of existing large geophysical and compositional datasets at the spatial scales of the entire Cascades subduction zone, linked through sets of common intensive variables such as heat and density, to determine the primary drivers of intra-arc magmatic diversity. Building on a successful Proof of Concept project that demonstrates the promise of the approach (Till et al., 2019), the project will test hypotheses about the relative roles of mantle magmatic flux vs. crustal characteristics and crustal magma storage depths in producing variations in erupted compositions and fluxes, and in controlling the geophysical state of the crust along strike in the Quaternary Cascades arc.

Composite materials, for example, are manufactured by intermingling two or more constituent materials and often have very different physical properties (heat or electrical conduction, for example) from the individual components. Surprisingly, the properties of the composite material are typically not a simple average of those of its components--it matters greatly how the (microscopic) intermingling is arranged. We want to understand precisely how the large number of microscopic interactions give rise to the macroscopic behavior of such systems, to be able to predict the macroscopic properties of the system by carefully looking at the microscopic arrangement of a sample, and to know exactly how large such a sample must be before our predictions are accurate. We proceed by developing and analyzing idealized mathematical models that display the key features and complexity of real physical systems, but still simple enough that they can be studied mathematically. Very often, our models are partial differential equations with stochastic coefficients--that is, the underlying microscopic behavior of the system is assumed to be random--and the goal is to understand the statistics of the system. Our objective is to develop mathematical approaches that are (i) informed by the physics of the systems, (ii) robust--they can help us solve a variety of other, similar problems arising in, for example, statistical physics and probability theory, and (iii) quantitative--they lead to quantitative estimates of the uncertainty and insight into the development of numerical algorithms for simulation and prediction. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Obtaining an ""averaged"" partial differential equation that describes the large-scale behavior of an underlying highly heterogeneous equation with many degrees of freedom (for instance, one with random coefficients) is referred to as ""homogenization"" in the mathematical literature. The homogenized equation is typically much simpler than the ""true"" heterogeneous one, and hence easier to work with. It is therefore important to understand precisely how well the homogenized equation approximates the true equation, and this is the goal of homogenization theory. Mathematicians have recently developed a complete quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization for elliptic equations, and this theory has already been shown to have some surprising and important applications to probability theory and statistical mechanics. The present project aims to continue in this direction, by applying and developing homogenization techniques for gradient lattice models and related models in statistical physics, to the study of hypoelliptic diffusions arising in kinetic theory (modeling gases and plasmas) and toward understanding the behavior of diffusions forced by random vector fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent discovery of superconductivity in thin films of doped NdNiO2 confirmed that these materials, based on nickel, can exhibit physics similar to the superconducting copper-based materials. In this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, new Ni1+/Ni2+ nickel-based materials are synthesized and their structure-property relationships are investigated in detail.  This impacts our understanding of the high-temperature superconductivity mechanism, potentially guiding the design of new superconductors and contributing to national energy security.<br/><br/>Educational impacts of the project will be achieved by training graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of inorganic synthesis, electrochemistry, crystallography, and various characterization techniques.

However, only a few such nickelates are known and no systematic investigation of doped d9/d8 nickelates has been performed. In this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, comprehensive investigations of syntheses, structures and properties of doped and undoped Ni1+/Ni2+ nickelates and oxyfluorides with NiO2 planes are producing new cuprate analogues and systematic structure-property relationships. Multiple families of compounds are being studied: doped infinite-layer nickelates with d8/d9 and d9/d10 ratios analogous to the superconducting cuprates, new n = 4 and 5 homologues of T-prime nickelate series as well as fluorinated T-prime nickelates. High-pressure, high-temperature synthesis is used for preparation of some doped parent Ruddlesden-Popper compounds. Low temperature, soft chemistry techniques are used for the preparation of the final (reduced) compounds. In addition to structure determination by powder X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments, physical properties are investigated by ambient and high pressure magnetic and transport measurements, solid-state NMR and muon spin rotation techniques.

The main aim of the project is to connect parts of algebraic and complex geometry that have previously been quite disjoint; in particular, it uses new tools (called Hodge modules), relying heavily on topology and analysis as well, in order to classify geometric shapes and singularities. This approach is generating numerous projects for Ph.D. students and the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will continue applying the theory of mixed Hodge modules to concrete problems in complex and birational geometry. He will also continue developing the theory of Hodge ideals, in collaboration with M. Mustata. This has been completed for Q-divisors, providing an extension of the theory of multiplier ideas in this setting, but new ideas need to be brought into play in order to obtain a similar picture for ideal sheaves, or for local cohomology. One hopes that this will lead to further interesting applications. In their work the PI and Mustata have already obtained applications regarding the singularities of theta divisors, hypersurfaces in projective space, or minimal exponents. In addition to further consequences along these lines, they will use the proposed extensions in order to study, for instance, effective bounds for linear series, or roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial. The PI has also been involved in applying the theory of Hodge modules towards the study of the variation of families smooth projective varieties of varieties, e.g. Brody hyperbolicity or Viehweg-type questions for parameter spaces. He will extend this study to families of singular varieties, especially those that appear in the theory of moduli of higher dimensional varieties according to Kollár and others, perhaps using those Hodge modules that extend variations of mixed Hodge structure.

School-based instructional coaches will develop new strategies for guiding STEM teaching and sustaining the work long-term.<br/><br/>The project goals are to:  (1) determine the feasibility and utility of the refined project approach, (2) determine the utility of the project?s implementation for facilitating change in teacher knowledge and practices, (3) understand the utility of the project?s implementation for fostering student change, and (4) understand the extent to which the refined project model supports organizational change in schools.  To do this, the program will make its professional development more accessible by adding a blended learning component, expanding the school leadership program, formalizing a training program for new facilitators, and identifying novel ways of defining student outcomes for transdisciplinary learning.  The mixed methods research design will involve twenty schools (elementary and intermediate) in New York City and New Haven, CT.  A quasi-experimental, within-school rotation model will randomize grade-level participation at the school level to yield a sample of at least 240 teachers, 3,000 students, 40 school-based coaches, and 20 administrators.  Quantitative data will primarily capture teacher and student outcomes, while the qualitative data will describe the context of the model implementation and provide a deeper understanding of the quantitative results. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

San Diego, to study the effects of two human enzymes known as Sulf1 and Sulf2. These enzymes act on the exterior of cell surfaces by recognizing and modifying the patterns of negatively charged groups on sugar polymers that are part of the outside coating of cells. In doing so they control the activity of proteins involved in critical cell signaling and development events. Despite being a key element in regulating important cellular functions, the structures of these enzymes and the sugars they act on are still poorly understood.  Additionally, their precise actions in a cellular context need better understanding.  This research project develops a set of new tools and techniques at the interface of chemistry and biology to fill the gaps in the basic understanding of the biological functions of these enzymes. These activities allow graduate students to obtain training in the interdisciplinary area of chemical biology focusing on carbohydrate chemistry and biology.  The students also gain a deeper understanding of the varied roles of carbohydrates in biology.  The educational and technical resources enabled by this award allow for the dissemination of the knowledge, tools, and techniques stemming from this research project to the broader research community and the general public. <br/><br/>This research develops novel methods to produce human sulfatase enzymes enabling detailed investigations of structure and mechanism. New chemical glycomics tools are envisioned to capture and structurally characterize the polysaccharide substrates for these enzymes. Further, biochemical and cell-based assays are under development to investigate their function during embryonic stem cell differentiation. The sulfatase enzymes are thought to have specificity for unique negatively charged regions of their sulfated polysaccharide substrates complementing the organization of positively charged residues in their substrate-binding domains. However, little information exists regarding the structure of the enzymes and the composition of their preferred substrates. Arrays comprising structurally defined sulfated polysaccharides from synthetic and biological sources are in use to identify preferred substrates for the sulfatase enzyme isoforms and to delineate how the enzymatic removal of sulfates from the polysaccharides impacts their interactions with growth factors. The chemical toolbox includes substrate-based fluorogenic probes for imaging sulfatase activity in biological environments and reactive molecules for chemical fingerprinting of substrates for structural characterization by mass spectrometry analysis. In combination, these tools are deployed to map how sulfatase enzymes control growth factor signaling during neural and mesenchymal differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells. The tools are general and suitable for the investigation of other biological systems where extracellular sulfatases exert important regulatory functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To realize the potential of E-transportation, it is necessary to pursue an interdisciplinary approach and continuous engagement with stakeholders. This project will build a collaborative team to investigate an E-hub concept that seeks to convert transit centers to host various E-modes.

Carbenes are highly reactive chemical species which feature a carbon that has only two bonds instead of the usual four. Carbenes that are coordinated with a variety of metals have played important roles in the production of commercially valuable materials. However, much less is known about carbenes in which one or both bonds of the carbon are attached to a metal. This research aims to address this gap in knowledge. This project also includes efforts to persuade high school students to consider STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines in college.  Professor Thamattoor provides research opportunities to high school students in the laboratory.  The group also works with teachers in the local grade schools to deliver quality instruction in STEM subjects. In recognition of the importance of global scientific cooperation, undergraduate students are provided with research opportunities in international laboratories.<br/><br/>Metal-coordinated carbene complexes are well known compounds that have had a transformative impact on synthesis and catalysis.

Through this RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) grant, a comprehensive set of projects is being undertaken to study stannylcarbenes.  These intermediates are generated photochemically from new precursors based on cyclopropanated phenanthrene and indan systems. The structure and reactivity of these tin-substitued carbenes are investigated experimentally by steady state photolysis, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, matrix isolation spectroscopy, and time-resolved laser flash photolysis, as well as by modern computational methods.

The findings of this research will provide new basic understanding of how the movement or dynamics of proteins and their interactions of other molecules affects protein function.  Better understanding of protein function could help in the design of new protein catalysts for biotechnology applications and well as lead to a greater understanding of how protein disfunction contributes to disease.  The research will also produce new computational tools, including new software, that will assist others in their research and in developing new technology. The research cuts across many disciplines, including chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics, and computer science, and provides an excellent opportunity to train students at all levels. More specifically, the research will have a broader impact on the scientific training of students at Georgia State University, with focus on better preparing underrepresented minority students for graduate school. Georgia State University is the largest and most diverse research-intensive university in Georgia, providing a unique opportunity to engage a diverse student body and underrepresented minority groups in science and engineering. Students will be equipped with research experiences, fundamental knowledge, and professional skills that are required to successfully transition to doctoral programs in chemical and biomedical sciences. Additionally, the project will provide outreach to a larger community through well-established programs at Georgia State University.<br/><br/>Protein conformational motions direct molecular recognition, enzyme catalysis, and allosteric regulation in many cellular processes. Conformational dynamics underlies the fine tuning of many cellular processes, including transient protein-protein interactions, signal transduction, and gene regulation in response to biochemical processes and changes in cellular conditions. Deregulation of the dynamics controlling one or more of these processes can lead to aberrant cellular function. Despite intensive studies on elucidating the complex structure-dynamics-function relationship, how protein function has evolved and is regulated remain poorly understood. The goal of the research is to establish the dynamical link for controllable modulations of function in proteins using large-scale computer simulations performed under distinct substrate-binding and sequence conditions. Specifically, the research will determine how various modifications of protein function, including gain and loss of catalytic activity, are achieved through evolution in the family of human cyclophilins and establish a complete model of the sequence dependent allosteric mechanism in human Pin1. Additionally, innovative and efficient computational methods will be developed to identify key allosteric residues in proteins from large simulation data. General principles of how allosteric signals microscopically propagate within a network of protein residue-residue interactions will be obtained, complementing the well-established thermodynamic models for macroscopic understanding of allosteric regulation. The research will provide deep insights into the role of protein dynamics in recognition, catalysis, and allosteric regulation in cellular processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decades of study on subduction zones have provided insight into the overarching processes that produce the magmas erupted, how the erupted magmas are produced at individual volcanoes, and a number of related questions. Despite this progress, a complex and largely unsolved problem is the cause of ubiquitous and dramatic variations in the amount and composition of magmas that erupt at volcanoes within the same subduction zone. Do these reflect processes acting deep within the Earth?s mantle, or in the overlying crust? Addressing this problem has important implications for understanding magma production and volcanic hazards, as worldwide almost a billion people live at risk from volcanoes. There is also a potential for scientific breakthrough by utilizing the existing large data sets acquired from recent NSF investments such as the MARGINS, GeoPRISMS, and EarthScope programs. However, addressing the question has proven challenging to date in part because of a lack of critical data for some locations, but largely because of the lack of suitable tools and approaches that allow us to quantitatively synthesize and compare the existing large data sets. <br/><br/>Thus, this is a multidisciplinary study to conduct a quantitative comparison of existing large geophysical and compositional datasets at the spatial scales of the entire Cascades subduction zone, linked through sets of common intensive variables such as heat and density, to determine the primary drivers of intra-arc magmatic diversity. Building on a successful Proof of Concept project that demonstrates the promise of the approach (Till et al., 2019), the project will test hypotheses about the relative roles of mantle magmatic flux vs. crustal characteristics and crustal magma storage depths in producing variations in erupted compositions and fluxes, and in controlling the geophysical state of the crust along strike in the Quaternary Cascades arc. The project has the potential to transform our understanding of these important regions and will produce a number of important broader impacts including, catalyzing interdisciplinary collaborations between three PI?s at three institutions, producing expert datasets widely and easily available to the Earth Science community, supporting undergraduate experiential learning activities.

These ultra-thin materials exhibit a host of new electronic and other effects that have applications to new technologies, such as high speed computing, solar energy harvesting, and quantum-based technologies. Over the past decade, many 2D materials have been discovered, including 2D metals, semiconductors, and magnets. Furthermore, these 2D materials can be stacked together to realize properties  that are enabled by the interactions between layers.  These new properties enable electronic and optical devices, like transistors, solar cells and lasers. This research is focused on investigating multi-layer 2D material samples that use these interlayer interactions to realize new electronic and optical properties. In particular, by combining two different 2D semiconductors, the research team will explore states with trapped electrons. These trapped electrons can act as quantum light sources, which would help enable quantum communication devices that are secure against cyber-attacks. This research aligns with the NSF Big Idea of the Quantum Leap: Leading the Next Quantum Revolution by developing material systems that have the potential to enable these new quantum information technologies. Furthermore, the project strengthens the STEM workforce both directly and indirectly by training and mentoring graduate, undergraduate, and high school students through the proposed research, and by encouraging interest in STEM at the high school level in southern Arizona.<br/><br/>The stacking of 2D materials in a vertical heterostructure leads to the formation of a long wavelength moiré pattern due to the lattice mismatch and relative orientation between the layers.  This moiré pattern modulates the electronic and optical properties of the heterostructure leading to the confinement of electrons in one layer and holes in the other layer.  These confined indirect excitons are known to serve as resources for quantum information science, and the PI will investigate how the novel physics of moiré confined excitons in 2D semiconductor heterostructures can be exploited to realize quantum devices with new functionalities.  This project is focused on 2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures consisting of MoSe2 and WSe2 which form a type-II heterojunction.  The research in this project advances knowledge of quantum materials physics by developing a comprehensive understanding of the role of twist angle and interlayer interactions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures.  In particular, the research has three aims: (1) Image the moiré potential in MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures using scanning tunneling microscopy, (2) Directly measure spatially modulated moiré exciton emission using low-temperature scanning near field optical microscopy and (3) Control moiré interlayer excitons in 2D heterostructures.  Lastly, modifying the interaction between layers and the potential landscape, allows for the tuning of the interlayer bandgap, the charging of trapped moiré excitons and the condensation of interlayer excitons in the moiré potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This strategy often stretches the limits of what can currently be done via geometric analysis, and simultaneously leads to new insights into these physics conjectures.

A second goal is to verify a similar conjectural description of hyperkaehler metrics on elliptically-fibered K3 surfaces by the physicists Kachru, Tripathy, and Zimet. The Hitchin moduli spaces and elliptically-fibered K3 surfaces are both algebraic completely integrable systems admitting a hyperkaehler metric. Both are fibered over a half-dimensional base and the generic fibers are abelian varieties. Some fibers are singular, and these conjectures are most interesting and most difficult near these singular fibers.

We call this phenomenon the cross-race recognition deficit (or CRD). The CRD is a robust effect which has been studied all over the world. It influences both White people trying to remember Black faces, but also Black people trying to remember White faces, and both groups trying to remember Asian faces. The team will investigate two psychological processes that may contribute to the CRD. First, people may fail to pick up on useful information in cross-race faces because they are untrained at finding the right kinds of information in those faces. Second, people may harbor an expectation that faces, in general, should look like faces from their own racial group, leading them to see cross-race faces as inherently foreign. In addition, the team will examine natural variation in cross-race contact which may underlie CRD, and will implement focused training with cross-race faces which will be delivered online or through a smartphone application. In this study, the team hopes to (a) shed light on a robust, important phenomenon that affects how people see one another, (b) examine a strategy to improve cross-race recognition, and (c) introduce improved tools (like a smartphone app) and measures that will be available for free to scientists and lay people alike.<br/><br/><br/>In this set of studies, the researchers will examine (a) the CRD, (b) the relationship between the CRD and the extent of an individual?s contact or experience with members of other racial groups, as well as (c) the cognitive operations that give rise to both the CRD and its relationship to contact. The work will leverage two prominent theories of visual processing ? perceptual learning and predictive coding ? to make predictions about the CRD, a phenomenon with far-reaching social psychological and societal consequences. Aim 1 of this proposal tests a theoretical model (Correll, Hudson, Guillermo, & Earls, 2016) which argues that the relationship between cross-race contact and the CRD is mediated by changes in (a) perceptual learning, which allows the perceiver to more efficaciously encode individuating information from the kinds of faces that a perceiver typically encounters; and (b) expectancies about what a face should look like, which again reflect the perceiver?s social experience. In Aim 2, the team turns to the question of how the CRD impacts generalization from one face to another. For example, if a participant learns that one member of a group is friendly (or unfriendly), does that information generalize to other members of the group? Robust theoretical arguments contend that similarity between stimuli should promote generalization, and the CRD ? at its heart ? reflects the perception of similarity among cross-race faces. The scientific impacts of this work are numerous: It will integrate vision science and social psychology, and explore an unusual method for reducing prejudice and stereotyping. Furthermore, the team will develop a free face-training smartphone application that will be available for researchers to use. The broader impacts of the work are also wide ranging: The CRD has many consequences outside the laboratory (e.g., eye-witness testimony, interpersonal interactions), and this project will investigate ways to reduce CRD. The team will develop and validate a free app that will be available to lay people who want to practice cross-race face recognition. In addition, given a diverse group of undergraduate research assistants at both institutions, this work will expose under-represented populations to the type of science from which these groups are often excluded.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology studies truly fundamental geometric issues about space that are unchanged even by smoothly bending and deforming the structure of space. As an example from three dimensions, a loop of string with a square knot tied into it is topologically distinct from a loop of string with a granny knot tied into it, in the sense that no amount of smooth deformation of the string or the space around it can turn one loop into the other; studying this kind of knottedness is the quintessential three-dimensional topological problem. Knottedness also happens in four dimensions, in numerous different ways, and is also at the core of smooth four-dimensional topology, and thus really at the core of understanding the shape and anatomy of exactly the kind of space that we spend our lives inhabiting. The research supported by this award will probe these problems by looking at four-dimensional topology from multiple different dimensions, ranging from a careful study of projections of four-dimensional spaces and their subspace onto two dimensional spaces to a careful study of motions of four-dimensional spaces inside five- and six-dimensional spaces. This research is also closely related to an outreach component, in which the principal investigator will work with design professionals and members of the local community to create exciting visualizations of important ideas in topology, to broaden the public's awareness of and interest in these fascinating topics. In addition the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Two of the biggest remaining problems in topology are the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures. (Poincare: Every homotopy 4-sphere is diffeomorphic to the standard 4-sphere. Schoenflies: Every smoothly embedded 3-sphere in 4-space bounds a smoothly embedded 4-ball.) A related and foundational problem is whether the smooth mapping class group of the 4-sphere is trivial. Existing techniques such as gauge theory say nothing in the context of these problems; the basic problem is that there seems to be ""nothing to hold on to"" when working with spheres or even homotopy spheres; low-dimensional topology needs new ideas. In collaboration first with Kirby and later with a larger group, the PI, over the course of several earlier NSF awards, developed the study of Morse 2-functions, generalizing Morse theory, and then developed the theory of trisections of 4-manifolds as a striking 4-dimensional analog to the theory of Heegaard splittings. This seems to be exactly what is needed to inject new life into 4-manifold topology and to allow for extensive cross-fertilization between the worlds of 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds. The past five years (2014-19), in particular, have seen an explosion of interest by other researchers in trisections, and a significant broadening of the community involved in this work. The PI also has a strong background in contact and symplectic topology; the proposed project with Licata builds on this work, using many of the same tools used in the work on trisections. Here are two long-shot motivational examples: It is conceivable that understanding the space of all trisections on the 4-sphere will allow us to show that certain self-diffeomorphisms are not isotopic to the identity, and also perhaps distinguish the 4-sphere from other homotopy 4-spheres. Likewise it is possible that a deeper understanding of contact topology in relation to 4-manifold topology, perhaps via trisections and open book decompositions, will allow us to see every embedded 3-sphere in 4-space as being of contact type, allowing us to use symplectic tools to settle the Schoenflies conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental physical effects that govern the functions of batteries, catalysts and fuel cells originate at the atomic level. Molecular dynamics simulations are indispensable tools with broad applicability for materials research due to their ability to probe microscopic details of atomic motion and predict thermodynamics, reaction kinetics and ionic diffusivities of many materials. Machine learning approaches are transforming how simulations of complex materials are performed; hence software tools are needed to make this transition faster and smoother. Our main goal is to advance machine learning methods and create software for constructing accurate fast simulation models that contain principled uncertainty of their predictions, which is a highly desirable target in many data science areas beyond atomistic modeling. Principled uncertainty quantification is especially critical for prediction of non-equilibrium dynamics, where rare important events, such as the breaking of bonds or atomic migration, determine the material?s performance but involve atomic configurations that are unlikely to be in a naive unbiased training set. Tools that we aim to develop will accelerate and automate computational research efforts in the fields of catalysis, batteries, thermal coatings, soft structural and functional materials, and actuators, to name a few.<br/><br/>Currently available tools for machine learning based force fields are based on non-parametric methods that only provide estimates without uncertainties, require large amounts of training data, and are slow to evaluate for large numbers of atoms of different species. Our goal is to develop community software infrastructure to enable a new paradigm of simulating non-equilibrium dynamics of complex materials, where ML models are automatically trained and dramatically accelerate ab-initio simulations on-the-fly, preserving exact physical symmetries with minimal accuracy loss. We will create and freely disseminate FLARE (Fast Learning of Atomistic Rare Events), a parallelized database-driven automation framework tightly coupling ML model training with high-fidelity DFT computations, using rigorous model uncertainty to guide data acquisition via closed-loop active learning. Specially designed many-body multi-species kernels and tools for systematic hyperparameter optimization will allow the models to be mapped to fast tabulated Bayesian force fields, implemented in the widely used MD software aimed at exascale computing performance. The result will be the ability to perform MD simulations of materials systems of millions of atoms at near-DFT accuracy and with predictive uncertainty. The unique advantages of the proposed infrastructure are (1) the automated training requiring minimal amounts of DFT data, (2) predictions containing principled Bayesian uncertainty, (3) scalable performance of at least 5 orders of magnitude faster than ab-initio molecular dynamics, and (4) ability to record full provenance and reproducibility information of training and prediction workflows.<br/><br/>This award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry within the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems within the NSF Directorate of Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, primarily of a geometric nature, and to use them to establish new instances of Langlands's conjectures. The award will support the training of students in this area of research that is considered of high interest.<br/><br/><br/>This project addresses the following fundamental question: what are the underlying geometric structures relating p-adic Galois representations to the mod p representation theory of p-adic groups? The project builds on several recent developments in which the various PIs have played key roles, including the construction of moduli stacks parametrizing p-adic representations of the Galois groups of p-adic local fields and of local models for these stacks, and recent extensions of the Taylor-Wiles patching method which relate it to the study of coherent sheaves on the local models, and to derived algebraic geometry. Some specific questions that the PIs will study are the problem of potentially crystalline lifts, the construction of a general p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and the possible local nature of the (a priori global) patching constuction.  More generally, the PIs intend to introduce algebro-geometric, categorical, and derived perspectives into the p-adic Langlands program, with the intention of gaining new insights into and making new progress on some of the key open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins play important roles in the cellular processes of peroxidases. Rare mutations involved in PTMs can alter molecular interaction sites and generate deleterious outcomes. However, the genetic mechanism of PTMs affected by rare mutations in peroxidases remains unknown. High throughput technologies generate large datasets for PTM sites and damaging mutations, which makes this discovering process possible. This project will develop novel computational tools to identify PTM sites and to predict the effects of mutations to peroxidases. The bioinformatics tools and databases developed in this program will be expected to have broader applications in broad biology research and machine learning community. In addition to the new computational tools and biological knowledge, this project will encourage  the participation of underrepresented minority students to STEM research. The creation of the Machine Learning course section and Big Data club will help students from HBCUs develop solid foundations for genetics and bioinformatics. The outreach activities, which include the involvement of students in research training activities, workshops and seminars, will help minority students develop essential skills in Big Data analytics. <br/><br/><br/>The project will investigate the effects of rare mutations and PTM sites in peroxidases using bioinformatics tools and experimental approaches.

However, they remain far inferior to human brain due to their inability to adapt and to process massive amounts of imprecise information. These capabilities can be accomplished with neuromorphic computing, which can be efficiently implemented at the hardware level by utilizing memristors - electronic devices whose resistance depends on their electrical history. The existing memristors operate mostly like on/off switches, lacking the ability to continuously vary the resistance in response to electric stimuli required for neuromorphic applications. These devices commonly rely on the physical motion of atoms, and as a result lack durability and reproducibility. The proposed project will develop a new class of memristors based on the special magnetic properties of ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers. The operation of the proposed devices will rely on the magnetic frustration at the interfaces between ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, resulting from the incompatible magnetic ordering of the two materials, which will lead to the formation of a viscous spin liquid state in the antiferromagnets. The project will explore the most suitable materials and geometries, electronic mechanisms enabling device operation, and device functionality at nanoscale. The proposed research will be integrated with STEM education through the development of a comprehensive undergraduate Materials and Engineering Physics program, which will include a hands-on freshman seminar and a state-of-art research training course for undergraduate students. The plan is also to organize a Science club at the local elementary school.<br/><br/>A theoretically envisioned ideal memristor is an electronic device whose resistance is proportional to the total charge that passes through it, with the coefficient of proportionality known as memristance. The proposed project will experimentally realize ideal memristor nanodevices, by utilizing bilayers of low-anisotropy ferromagnets, such as Permalloy, and thin films of antiferromagnets such as NiO, CoO, or Fe50Mn50. A spin liquid state is expected to be formed in the antiferromagnets, due to the magnetic frustration associated with the random exchange interaction at the magnetic interface. The proposed project will utilize a combination of material and heterostructure engineering, nanofabrication, measurements of time-domain magnetic dynamics and transverse ac susceptibility, to address questions related to physical mechanisms of device operation, and device design. The proposed research will explore the possibility to engineer frustrated thin-film magnetic heterostructures that exhibit a spin liquid state with a well-defined and tunable viscosity, resulting in ideal memristive functionality with controlled memristance. Additionally, the project will identify and characterize the magnetoelectronic mechanisms that can facilitate writing, reading, and resetting of the memristive devices based on viscous spin liquids. The relevant length scales for the memristive properties will be established, to determine whether the proposed devices are scalable to the technologically relevant nanoscale dimensions.  By addressing these questions, the proposed project will provide a transformative contribution to the research and development of memristive devices characterized by high-endurance, scalability, and tunable memristive properties, which will facilitate the implementation of efficient neuromorphic networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying problems often arise from practical applications in the three-dimensional world we live in, but also from more theoretical considerations in mathematical physics. The project investigates a surprising connection between two very different approaches to 3-dimensional topology. The first approach is very algebraic and involves so-called quantum invariants for knotted curves in 3-dimensional spaces. The second approach is more geometric and analytic, and uses the non-euclidean geometry of the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space.  The Kashaev Volume Conjecture, experimentally verified on many examples but still without a mathematical proof guaranteeing that it holds in all cases, provides an unexpected connection between these two viewpoints. The award provides support for graduate students who will be involved in related research.<br/><br/>More precisely, the Kashaev Volume Conjecture connects the asymptotics of the colored Jones polynomial of a knot to the hyperbolic volume of its complement.

The goal of the project is to develop various steps in a roadmap towards a proof of the Kashaev Volume Conjecture, with a special emphasis on its analytic subtleties. As a first step, the project is focused on a closely related conjecture for surface bundles over the circle, where the combinatorics of quantum invariants are more clearly connected to the geometry of the underlying manifold. The PI and his collaborators will attack this conjecture in the even more special case of punctured torus bundles, in an effort  to be very concrete while tackling the analytic difficulties that arise in this context.

There is great interest, both scientifically and technologically, in semiconductors that can emit light with wavelengths somewhat longer than visible light, i.e. in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Such light sources, when fabricated on silicon chips, could become key components in future ubiquitous chemical sensor networks, in speeding up data transfer between and on silicon chips, and in motion sensors required by autonomous vehicles. This research project focuses on a semiconductor material system, germanium-tin, that holds great promise for mid-infrared light emission on silicon chips. The efficiency of light emission by germanium-tin is limited by the presence of atomic scale defects that grow into the material when it is synthesized. This project characterizes the nature and number of such defects, and investigates methods for annihilating or altering them to minimize their effects on germanium-tin. Undergraduates are involved in these research activities, with special efforts made to recruit highly competitive undergraduate researchers from groups that are under-represented in the US science and engineering workforce. The project includes a partnership with Stanford?s RISE outreach program, to inspire high school students to consider further education and careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Exhibiting a direct bandgap at sufficiently large (x ~ 10 atomic %) tin composition, Ge(1-x)Sn(x) alloys hold great promise for mid-infrared (IR) light emitters and absorbers, while also being monolithically compatible with silicon electronic and photonic technologies. Previous research on germanium-tin epitaxial films grown on silicon has demonstrated mid-IR optically-pumped lasing, and there has been a gradual trend of increasing Sn content to access longer wavelength operation. The light emission characteristics of Ge(1-x)Sn(x) are still far from optimal. Low growth temperatures (< 300°C) used to promote high Sn content alloys cause large concentrations of acceptor-type vacancy defects to form.  Strong pairing of Sn atoms with these vacancies is predicted theoretically and will result in enhanced non-radiative carrier recombination, reducing the efficiency of light emission and absorption. This project uses strain-engineered core-shell nanowire structures as a platform to study post-growth annealing to dissociate Sn-vacancy pairs and to annihilate vacancies incorporated in the Ge(1-x)Sn(x) shells during their growth. Shells of thickness up to 500 nm are of particular interest, to achieve wire structures capable of efficiently guiding mid-IR light. Synchrotron diffuse x-ray scattering is used to characterize trends in the relative concentration of vacancies bound to Sn atoms, divacancies, clusters and monovacancies in the alloys versus annealing time and temperature. A key goal is to understand the rates and mechanisms governing the approach to vacancy equilibrium in these alloys. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis provides an additional probe of local bonding around Sn atoms and the stability of Sn-vacancy pairs. The project also examines atomic fluorine as a chemical vacancy passivant, building on prior experience with F passivation of Si surface states and vacancies in Ge. Coupling between x-ray and optoelectronic characterization of the core-shell wires can reveal fundamental insights into the connection between point defects and device-relevant properties. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence, photoconductivity and ultra-fast pump-probe measurements are used to probe Ge(1-x)Sn(x) band structure and the effects of different vacancy defect populations on carrier recombination dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Efficient production of enough potable water for an increasing population requires technicians with specialized knowledge and skills. Well over 90% of US public water systems serve fewer than 10,000 people and are classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as Rural Small Water Systems. Because of retirements and use of new technologies, the rural water industry has a growing need for new technicians who are skilled in these new technologies.  Filling this need is complicated by chronic challenges in providing equitable education and training opportunities to rural residents. This project will address the need for Rural Small Water Systems technicians by providing an educational model that is designed to serve a rural population. Specifically, this project plans to develop online instructional modules to educate rural water technicians who have the knowledge and skills required by a modernizing industry. Through distance learning strategies, the project will also enable practicing rural technicians to build or update their skills. The rural small water system curriculum will cover the spectrum of knowledge and skills needed to ensure the proper installation, inspection, maintenance, repair, management, and operation of successful small public water systems.<br/><br/>The project will develop 20 online instructional modules that address advanced knowledge and skills not currently fully covered in the existing Water and Environmental Technology program.  These modules will be integrated into six current Water and Environmental courses and fully online versions of the courses will be developed.  These changes are expected to better serve students who live and work beyond commuting reach, as well as working technicians who seek additional education from rural locations.  The modules will include video presentations, technical documents, and virtual field experiences.  This work will be done in consultation with industry partners, the Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center, and the Regional Center for Nuclear Education and Training, thus leveraging existing knowledge and resources that include expertise in online and virtual education.  All modules will be available nationwide to other educational programs and to industries for training purposes. Representatives of the region?s water industries have agreed to work with the project personnel to ensure that the modules address their needs for technical knowledge and skills. It is expected that this online module-based training platform can serve as a model for other programs interested in reaching rural students and meeting rural needs. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work performed in this project will be conducted by promising young scientific investigators from undergraduate to graduate to post-doctoral fellows and will serve to train the next generation of scientists in the American work force.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project will define the structural and thermodynamic interactions between the capsid proteins required for shell assembly and stability. The studies will employ biochemical (mutagenesis), biophysical (analytical ultracentrifugation), computational (molecular dynamics) and structural (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, crystallography, cryo-Electron Microscopy) approaches in a coordinated manner. Fundamental interactions between the scaffolding and capsid proteins required for high-fidelity shell assembly are also interrogated. The results of the studies will reveal molecular interactions essential to shell assembly and stability in the large double-stranded DNA viruses, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. These data have significant implications in anti-viral therapeutics, phage therapy and nanotechnology applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding of the development of high-altitude adaptations in has been enriched by recent anthropological investigations. Such studies have revealed specific challenges regarding strategies for securing a reliable food supply in different seasons. The goal of this research is to increase understanding of how to achieve long-term resilience in the context of concerns regarding food security and more frequent extreme climate events. Archaeology is well placed to provide meaningful insights on resilience because it provides information on people?s behaviors over a long time span. This research will promote understanding of the past, as well as the present by documenting invaluable animal resources and resilient strategies in harsh areas, where biodiversity is threatened. Educational and outreach activities will deepen broad scale academic cooperation, as well as facilitate the development of open academic environments. <br/><br/>By focusing on animal resources that people used at high altitudes, this research explores the ways that societies were able to be more resilient to periodic stresses and to survive despite the inhospitable and unpredictable environment. The researchers will conduct comprehensive study of prehistoric animal remains from one of the world?s most inhospitable areas. The questions of how farming and hunting settlers managed to live year-round in this high altitude region remain largely unanswered and have been obscured by the scarcity of zooarchaeological studies conducted to date. The researchers will combine systematic zooarchaeological and stable isotopes analyses, and regional ethnographical surveys. This research will reveal animal-based subsistence strategies of pastoral groups and investigate at high resolution how they managed livestock and utilized local natural landscapes.

This shift to data-driven decision making is creating a growing workforce demand for Data Science and Analytics professionals.  In a 2018 report, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that jobs in data science and analytics will grow 34% by 2026.  However, thus far, very few two-year institutions offer data analytics programs that could prepare students for entry-level positions in data science and analytics.  To create new pathways into data science and analytics careers, this project intends to establish a college credit-based certificate in data analytics.  In concert with this goal, it also aims to increase the College?s capacity for high quality data science instruction and to broaden participation in data science, with a focus on inclusion of women.  In addition to its potential to increase the capacity and quality of the data science workforce in New Jersey, the project may also provide a model for other institutions that are interested in building new data science programs. <br/><br/>The major goal of the project is to develop a 15-credit data science certificate that integrates technology such as R, Tableau, Python, and SQL into the curriculum.  Less than 20 community college-based data science programs appear to exist in the US, and this certificate is believed to be the first at any community college in the greater New York/New Jersey metropolitan area.  The curriculum will be informed by an industry advisory committee and implement national recommendations for data science education, including teaching statistics thinking, integrating real data with a context and a purpose, and using project-based learning.  The project intends to recruit women into the field through collaboration with the College?s Women in STEM Club, R-Ladies Global, and faculty development.  The resulting certification will prepare students to enter the workforce as data analytics professionals, or to transfer to four-year programs where they can acquire the advanced credentials needed for mid- to high-level data scientist positions.

In Greenland, small-scale fishers outnumber large-scale fishers by over 8:1. While small-scale fisheries are culturally, economically, and socially indispensable, they may be difficult to govern and access. The perceived legitimacy of institutions that regulate access to fisheries are poorly understood, even though they have significant impacts on fisheries globally. This research investigates an Arctic halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) fishery and how stakeholders? attitudes are informed by 1) key historical, social, and spatial factors that affect fisheries access, and 2) perceived institutional legitimacy. The results of such research have critical implications for comparable fisheries in Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic.<br/><br/>This research employs the ?Q? method, developed to systematically and reproducibly evaluate participant perspectives on issues with competing viewpoints. Using Q, the investigator will identify and evaluate key variables in how fishers and other stakeholders perceive the legitimacy of institutional arrangements governing fisheries. The work will also evaluate the extent to which perceived institutional legitimacy converges across and within stakeholder groups, including policymakers, scientists, regulatory agencies, resource managers, and fishers from different communities. The investigator hypothesizes that perceived institutional legitimacy is affected by study participants? experience and awareness of socio-historical variables, such as previous regulatory arrangements, and by their location relative to unregulated fisheries. Use of Q will be complemented with ethnographic interviews and workshops; statistical analyses will follow data collection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations of interest came from high energy physics where they were introduced as very symmetric models for elementary particle interactions.  Basic question to address with regards to solutions are these:  Are there finitely many or infinitely many solutions for the specific applications?  In either case, what do the solutions look like?  And what are their implications with regards to four dimensional spaces?  By way of background:  The equations are far too complicated for a computer to solve (let alone to solve by hand).  Because of this, almost all information about the solutions must be obtained via a detailed analysis of the equations themselves.  With regards to questions about four dimensional spaces, the central issue here is to understand the list of possible four dimensional spaces.  This last question is also relevant to physics by virtue of the fact that the observable universe has four dimensions--three spatial dimensions and then the time direction.  Since the equations of interest come from high energy physics theory and are close cousins to others used there and in condensed matter physics, the analysis tools developed in this project may also find applications to questions in these other fields.  There is also an important educational support aspect of this project that is meant to bring graduate students up to speed on the relevant geometry, topology and analysis.<br/><br/>The research in this prject has three primary focus points.  The first concerns the behavior of the solutions to the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of a three-dimensional manifold and the half-line with singular boundary conditions at one end given by a knot in the three-manifold.  The goal for this focus point is to see whether non-convergent sequences of solutions have pathologies that prevent solution counting definitions of knot invariants for knots in the three dimensional manifold.  Two sources of trouble likely arise, one is a novel pathology from the boundary conditions, and the other due to the presence of Z/2 harmonic 1-forms.  The second focus point concerns the algebraic implications of the structure of the solution space for these same Kapustin-Witten equations and for the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of the three-manifold with the line:  Can an algebraic invariant be defined from these spaces given the non-compactness issues and with the novelty of formally zero dimensional solution spaces?  The third focus point concerns the significance of the afore-mentioned Z/2 harmonic 1-forms and, more generally, Z/2 harmonic sections of a spin bundle.  Such Z/2 harmonic sections appear as renormalized limits of sequences of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations on four dimensional manifolds and the multi-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations on manifolds of dimensions three and four.  Specific topics and questions not withstanding, the long term goal of this project is to understand the structure of smooth, four dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the proposed research will develop a statistical framework for generative learning, which is primarily motivated by applications for unstructured data, namely topic sentence generation and high-order hyperlink prediction. The research will develop powerful generative methods for generating instances or examples to describe and interpret the corresponding learning model.  Moreover, it will develop network models for modeling high-order interactions and relations of units by identifying hidden structures in networks. It will proceed in two areas: (1) instance generation and topic sentence generation; (2) hyperlink prediction for multiway relations in hypergraphs. In the first area, instance generation, particularly sentence generation, will be performed collaboratively with numerical embeddings in categorization and regression. In the second area, hyperlinks will be predicted based on observed pairwise as well as unobserved high-order relations, characterized by graphical models with hidden structures.

There is a critical need to understand the source and persistence of this pollution to protect our Nation's freshwater resources. The purpose of this OPUS:MCS grant is to enable a new synthesis of ongoing research on this topic by a mid-career scientist at Dominican College of Blauvelt. This will be facilitated through partnership with a colleague at the University of Massachusetts to gain new capabilities to enhance the PI's research productivity and teaching repertoire.  For a number of years, the PI's undergraduate students at Dominican College have been involved in collection and characterization of microbiome samples from various streams in the Hudson River watershed with the goal of identifying sources of organic pollution. The objective of this project is to synthesize these datasets to more clearly understand microbial distribution patterns, especially in relationship to headwater location, local weather and climate.  Additional datasets will be analyzed to better understand dynamic fluctuations in community structure and function at selected sites. Training of students in computational genomics while synthesizing these data will garner them more opportunities when entering the STEM workforce. Dissemination of this work includes the creation of training workshops for interested citizen science groups concerned about their own communities, and making genomic data available via a public database.<br/> <br/>This project will explore the use of advanced methodologies to elucidate the nature of microbial communities in surface waters of creeks and streams in the Hudson River watershed. Data derived from next-generation meta-genomic and -transcriptomic sequencing will enable researchers to examine the overall vitality and stability of these streams, providing baseline information by which impacts related to further pollution and environmental change can be measured.  By integrating community profiling and meta-'omics data of samples derived from a polluted freshwater creek, the results will inform local water keeper and citizen science groups as they document water quality and develop more reliable methods by which to locate contamination sources.  Genomic and expression data derived from microbiome communities in sediment and water from Sparkill Creek will be used to determine the nature and impact of the contamination.  These analyses have the potential to identify problems regarding sources and sinks of microbial pollution, and assess the utility of this type of comparative analysis in elucidating unseen problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to create opportunities for teachers to notice and understand how normalized practice often reproduces inequity and learn ways to disrupt typical patterns of inequity in their classroom. The project will design and study professional development that works on practice centered on the disruption of patterns of injustice. This project focuses on classroom discussions because they can be a key site for either reproducing or disrupting inequities and they have been established as a powerful instructional practice. In addition to studying the impact of the professional development on teachers? teaching skill, the project also explores teachers? perceptions of their learning, influences on teachers? professional learning, and the impact of a mathematics-focused professional development versus a generalized focus on teaching practice and perception of learning. The project will generate new knowledge regarding ways in which elementary mathematics teachers can be supported to learn effective teaching practices. <br/><br/>Teachers benefit from professional development that addresses both the technical and contextual aspects of teaching practice, including the identities of their students and associated patterns of inequity in schools and society. This research will examine how elementary teachers? perceptions of professional learning and influences on such learning in combination with professional development on leading discussions, impact their skill with and willingness to take up teaching that disrupts patterns of inequity in classrooms. In terms of influences on teachers? professional learning, the project will address teachers? beliefs about students and learning, their understanding of the pervasiveness of inequity in normalized practice, contextual factors such as their relationship with administration or their status in the school community, and their readiness for, skill with, and implementation of the practice upon beginning the professional learning. The studies will examine: (1) What are teachers? perceptions of their own learning, discussion-leading practice, and attention to disrupting inequity? How well matched are these perceptions with external measures? What supports do teachers perceive as impacting their learning? How does principal selection criteria and communication with teachers about their selection impact teachers? perceptions and engagement? (2) In what ways does professional development on leading discussions combined with peer and coach support impact teachers? skill and willingness to engage in that teaching practice including disrupting patterns of inequity? (3) Does a mathematics focus produce different outcomes than a generalized focus for teaching practice or perception of learning? The project will collect and analyze several types of data, including measures of skill with leading mathematics and literacy discussions, teacher perceptions, and willingness and skill with disrupting patterns of inequity during discussions.

First, people may fail to pick up on useful information in cross-race faces because they are untrained at finding the right kinds of information in those faces. Second, people may harbor an expectation that faces, in general, should look like faces from their own racial group, leading them to see cross-race faces as inherently foreign. In addition, the team will examine natural variation in cross-race contact which may underlie CRD, and will implement focused training with cross-race faces which will be delivered online or through a smartphone application. In this study, the team hopes to (a) shed light on a robust, important phenomenon that affects how people see one another, (b) examine a strategy to improve cross-race recognition, and (c) introduce improved tools (like a smartphone app) and measures that will be available for free to scientists and lay people alike.<br/><br/><br/>In this set of studies, the researchers will examine (a) the CRD, (b) the relationship between the CRD and the extent of an individual?s contact or experience with members of other racial groups, as well as (c) the cognitive operations that give rise to both the CRD and its relationship to contact. The work will leverage two prominent theories of visual processing ? perceptual learning and predictive coding ? to make predictions about the CRD, a phenomenon with far-reaching social psychological and societal consequences. Aim 1 of this proposal tests a theoretical model (Correll, Hudson, Guillermo, & Earls, 2016) which argues that the relationship between cross-race contact and the CRD is mediated by changes in (a) perceptual learning, which allows the perceiver to more efficaciously encode individuating information from the kinds of faces that a perceiver typically encounters; and (b) expectancies about what a face should look like, which again reflect the perceiver?s social experience. In Aim 2, the team turns to the question of how the CRD impacts generalization from one face to another. For example, if a participant learns that one member of a group is friendly (or unfriendly), does that information generalize to other members of the group? Robust theoretical arguments contend that similarity between stimuli should promote generalization, and the CRD ? at its heart ? reflects the perception of similarity among cross-race faces. The scientific impacts of this work are numerous: It will integrate vision science and social psychology, and explore an unusual method for reducing prejudice and stereotyping. Furthermore, the team will develop a free face-training smartphone application that will be available for researchers to use. The broader impacts of the work are also wide ranging: The CRD has many consequences outside the laboratory (e.g., eye-witness testimony, interpersonal interactions), and this project will investigate ways to reduce CRD. The team will develop and validate a free app that will be available to lay people who want to practice cross-race face recognition. In addition, given a diverse group of undergraduate research assistants at both institutions, this work will expose under-represented populations to the type of science from which these groups are often excluded.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a crisis like the current COVID-19 pandemic, the role of urban green spaces in promoting public health and well-being may be an especially important co-benefit of green infrastructure (GI) programs. However, there is simultaneous acknowledgement that being outdoors, even in green space, is a continuing source of risk for exposure and/or spread of COVID-19. Therefore, this research asks, how do variations in access to green space, whether due to lack of safe, nearby green space and/or the perceived risk associated with being outdoors in particular kinds of spaces during a public pandemic, impact well-being? To answer these questions, this study uses online surveys and video interviews with college students. These students have traveled home from their campuses, returning to a wide variety of residential and landscape forms, presenting an opportunity to conduct comparative study of how access to green space influences responses to current conditions and well-being. The survey, distributed via email, includes questions about well-being, outdoor activity, risk perception, and personal responses to social distancing/self-isolation measures. Interviewees, solicited from survey participants, will be asked questions about available outdoor green space and activity, lifestyle changes in response to COVID-19 and their effect on well-being, the role of outdoor activity in subjects' well-being, and barriers to outdoor activity under present circumstances. Both statistical analyses and qualitative coding analyses will be used to determine (a) subjects' access to different types of green space; (b) subjects' willingness to utilize green space with respect to type, accessibility, and risk perception; and (c) the association of (a) and (b) with subjects' well-being during the pandemic. <br/><br/>This study will expand knowledge on the co-benefits of green infrastructure (GI) programs, with an emphasis on the co-benefit of health and well-being during times of great stress. This study will allow determination of the impacts on well-being for a wide-range of green space types and accessibility, across and within landscape forms (urban, suburban, rural). As such, this study will contribute to understandings of how novel, large-scale stress-inducing events intersect with differences in green space type and access to contribute to inequalities in human well-being. By collecting data from a diverse study population located across a broad area this study will be able to make comparisons across a range of green space types and access. This will further understanding of the mechanisms by which green space affects well-being, applicable to a range of fields like public health, civil engineering, urban ecology, and urban design and planning. This research will address two primary broader implications for well-being in the face of current and future global pandemic-related challenges. First, this study examines how green space access affects well- being during social distancing/stay-at-home conditions, such as those experienced by more than three-fifths of the US population. Second, this study will provide detailed information on subjects' choices and behaviors regarding outdoor recreation during social distancing/stay-at-home conditions, including risk perception and beliefs about the importance of green space access. Together these data will be used to inform current and future preparations and responses to pandemics and other extreme emergency circumstances through recommendations on outdoor recreation, well-being, and current and future planned GI design. Attention to characteristics of neighborhoods by type of building and by population characteristics will support GI planning and implementation by providing fine spatial resolution for the integration of GI contributions to well-being with GI contributions to stormwater management and other environmental benefits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experimental studies make use of a range of complementary techniques available on site and through collaborations with researchers at United States National Laboratories. Developing a better conceptual framework for understanding water uptake/loss from crystalline solids can significantly improve our ability to predict the properties of this broad class of materials and to employ solid state dehydration as a rational means to create new crystalline forms.

Data mining efforts are used to identify packing motifs which favor particular dehydration mechanisms and anhydrous products.

The predictive power of the correlations identified through these structure-mechanism studies are then rigorously tested through dehydration studies on new hydrate systems.

A key application would be modernization of the electricity grid to integrate energy sources, energy storage and diverse users? needs such as DC and AC power systems. Moreover, electrons emitted from diamond into water can enable chemical reactions for a variety of applications. The research will use new methods to modify diamond and its surface to enable these applications. The results will support the development of diamond power transistors, high frequency components for communications and electron emission into water for localized chemical reactions not possible with other materials. This project will collaborate with ASU Sundial, a program which supports retention and diversity in the physical sciences. The activities with Sundial include research related workshops, mentoring and the development of an outreach-level scientific conference, geared at community members and local high school students and teachers.  The goal of these activities is to increase access to science careers to students who are traditionally under-represented, by improving retention and educational enrichment opportunities for these students.<br/><br/>Technical Description <br/>Diamond is a wide band gap semiconductor with outstanding semiconductor properties that have long been recognized as beneficial for high power and high frequency applications. With specific surface termination, diamond has a negative electron affinity that can enable injection of electrons into water for localized catalysis.  The high electron and hole mobilities of diamond are unusual compared to all other wide band gap semiconductors. While p-type doping with boron has been well characterized for two decades, n-type doping with phosphorus has recently advanced in a number of laboratories, and understanding Electrons in Diamond could enable a new generation of diamond devices based on electron transport and electron emission from conduction band states into vacuum or water. The focus of this proposal is on electron injection and diamond-dielectric interfaces to enable electron transport, confinement, and surface emission. This proposal will address three fundamental challenges to achieving Electrons in Diamond: 1) Can electrons be transported into the conduction band of diamond? The low or negative electron affinity of diamond means that the n-type Schottky barrier for contact metals on diamond will be large and prohibit electron injection. 2) Can a dielectric-diamond interface be formed that confines electrons in diamond? A dielectric-semiconductor interface to confine electrons requires a conduction band offset where the dielectric conduction band minimum is above the diamond conduction band minimum. 3) Can a surface termination of diamond enable continued efficient electron emission into vacuum or water? While hydrogen terminated diamond has a negative electron affinity, the surface is unstable in vacuum or oxidizing environments including water.  The understanding gained from this program will set the stage for new applications of diamond as a semiconductor for electronics or localized catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, primarily of a geometric nature, and to use them to establish new instances of Langlands's conjectures. The award will support the training of students in this area of research that is considered of high interest.<br/><br/><br/>This project addresses the following fundamental question: what are the underlying geometric structures relating p-adic Galois representations to the mod p representation theory of p-adic groups? The project builds on several recent developments in which the various PIs have played key roles, including the construction of moduli stacks parametrizing p-adic representations of the Galois groups of p-adic local fields and of local models for these stacks, and recent extensions of the Taylor-Wiles patching method which relate it to the study of coherent sheaves on the local models, and to derived algebraic geometry. Some specific questions that the PIs will study are the problem of potentially crystalline lifts, the construction of a general p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and the possible local nature of the (a priori global) patching constuction.  More generally, the PIs intend to introduce algebro-geometric, categorical, and derived perspectives into the p-adic Langlands program, with the intention of gaining new insights into and making new progress on some of the key open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The compression software broker that this project provides will facilitate the adoption of modern compression techniques in many branches of science. Compressors come in two flavors: lossless, those that perfectly preserve the original information; and lossy, those that irretrievably discard parts of the ""signal"" to further improve compression. Modern lossless and lossy compression improvements in efficiency, speed, and fidelity, are striking and will benefit critical research areas by permitting researchers to simulate, store, and analyze phenomena such as stellar evolution, chemical reactions, and hurricane formation at finer detail than before, with no extra storage costs. Since digital storage consumes power, better compression also reduces power consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. This project will develop the software infrastructure necessary for scientific researchers to seamlessly shift their applications to produce and use data stored with state-of-the-art lossless techniques, and by new lossy techniques that are more accurate than any others.<br/><br/>The two most widely-used self-describing dataset storage formats, HDF5 and netCDF4, support by default only one patent unencumbered lossless compression format, the venerable DEFLATE algorithm standardized in the 1990s.

We will populate the CCR with cutting-edge open-source compression technology, including the LZ4, Facebook's Zstandard, and Google's Snappy codecs, and will implement default netCDF support for the CCR. Sequential lossy-then-lossless compression improves both the size and speed of compression/decompression yet is currently tedious to perform. We will implement a user-friendly method to ""chain"" codecs into sequential operations in memory (no intermediate files required) in our widely used netCDF Operators software package. We will also produce a new precision-preserving lossy codec, Granular Bit Grooming, that has unsurpassed compression ratio and statistical accuracy.

One can study the properties of the surface by considering the space of all shapes it can have. This space of shapes is called the moduli space of the surface. One example would be if a circle is allowed to change its shape but remain an ellipse, then the moduli space would be described by two numbers, the length of the short axis and the length of the long axis and therefore be two dimensional. Topological surfaces (and higher dimensional objects) can be studied by considering the shape or geometry of its moduli space. One such geometry is the Weil-Petersson geometry which plays an important role in mathematics and physics. This NSF award supports a project with a focus on the Weil-Petersson geometry of a moduli space. In prior work, the PI and collaborators introduced a flow on the moduli space of a surface, called the Weil-Petersson renormalized volume gradient flow. This flow reveals much of the structure of the moduli space of three-dimensional spaces. For a large class of three-dimensional spaces this is a uniformizing flow, flowing any shape to make it as symmetric as possible: in the circle analogy, making the ellipse become a round circle. One of the major directions is to show that this flow is uniformizing for all spaces of a certain type. This work is at the intersection of mathematics and physics and is expected to lead to new connections between the two fields. The project will support a graduate student and allow the PI to disseminate the work through conferences and seminars. <br/><br/>The project focuses on two main areas of research, 1) renormalized volume and its Weil-Petersson gradient flow and 2) the Weil-Petersson geometry of higher Teichmuller spaces. These two areas are relatively new, having developed over the last fifteen years. In 1) the PI plans to use renormalized volume to study the structure of hyperbolic three-manifolds. The renormalized volume of a hyperbolic manifold is closely related to its convex core volume but has nicer analytic properties such as being a smooth function on moduli space. In prior work, the PI and collaborators introduced the Weil-Petersson gradient flow of renormalized volume to study the geometry of the deformation space of convex cocompact hyperbolic structures on a three dimensional manifold. In particular this work showed that when the space is acylindrical then the flowlines are Weil-Petersson quasigeodesics and that the renormalized volume is minimized at the unique structure which has convex core boundary totally geodesic. Furthermore, a surgered version of the flow is a uniformizing flow, flowing every point to the unique structure which has convex core boundary totally geodesic. A major project is to show that in the boundary incompressible case, the flow limits to the conjectured decomposition along its windows and acylindrical pieces. In higher Teichmuller theory the PI and collaborators consider extending the analytic and metric structure of classical Teichmuller theory to geometric representations into higher rank Lie groups. In earlier work, the PI and collaborators introduced a natural extension of the Weil-Petersson metric to higher Teichmuller theory. More recently they have generalized the construction to define extensions based on the simple roots of the associated Lie algebra.

To remain competitive, U.S. industries need to rapidly accelerate the use of intelligent robotics.  As a result, the nation needs to train highly skilled technicians who can program, use, maintain, and repair intelligent industrial robots. This collaborative project will address the nation?s shortfall of qualified technicians in intelligent industrial robotics.  It intends to do so by establishing a collaboration between academic institutions and major manufacturers in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama. Together these partners will define the necessary skillset for the next-generation industrial robotics technical workforce.  They will also develop a curriculum that will allow students to learn those skills. This project will result in one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  This effort will thus support U.S. businesses and industries to rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.<br/><br/>The project has the following specific aims:  1) develop intelligent robotics curricular modules; 2) implement train-the-trainer workshops for educators; 3) identify skill sets needed for handling the next-generation robotics; 4) develop a knowledge base of next-generation robotics for secondary and post-secondary educators; and 5) increase public awareness of next-generation robotics.  By using a collaboration among four academic institutions in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama, and involving major manufacturers in the region, the project expects to deliver outcomes that will be sustainable and can be replicated or adapted at other institutions.  This project intends to develop one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training at community and technical colleges in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  Since community and technical college supply a significant percentage of the industrial workforce, this project has the potential to help U.S. businesses and industries rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.

These complexes also exhibit changes in magnetic properties with light. Functional materials that change magnetism, color or charge upon application of external stimuli (light, electric field, or magnetic field) are central to the development of non-volatile memory technologies for computers, spintronics devices, and sensors for quantum information science.  The materials designed and developed in this research can be used as ""qubits"" in Quantum computing, communications, and sensors. In general, a qubit possesses at least two well-defined states that can be prepared and addressed independently. Qubits can interact with stimuli to generate an infinite number of intermediate states leading to exciting new possibilities for data processing, storage, and sensing at the quantum level.  The immediate goal of this project is the creation of a generalized strategy for molecular qubits that can be controlled with light under ambient conditions to enable embedded resistive memory devices and sensors with significantly decreased energy demand. The research lies at the interface of chemistry, physics, and material science, providing multidisciplinary training to students in the STEM sciences. The research project will also serve as a platform for Community Engaged Learning and the development of modified teaching practices for increasing the success of diverse groups in the STEM fields. Community-engaged learning activities will involve research assistantships with structured mentoring activities for middle-school and high-school students and the development of new teaching strategies for diverse learners in the undergraduate classroom. <br/><br/>The concept of coupling optically-bistable photochromic ligands to electronically-bistable metal complexes is a strategy for controlling the electronic structure and lifetime of optically-gated functional materials. Photochromic spirooxazine ligands have two electronic states that can be gated optically. When coupled to an electronically bistable cobalt semiquinone with two ground state electronic states, a four-state electronic system is generated. This coupling, a Photoisomerization Induced Spin Charge Excited State (PISCES) process, could lead to a powerful strategy for optically gating spin states. The electronic coupling between metal center and photochrome states, however, is complex, and fundamental studies towards elucidating the primary mechanism of electronic coupling are central to the expansion of this strategy towards other spin-based systems. This project will determine the fundamental electronic and structural factors that govern PISCES processes in a broad class of electronically bistable metal complexes that can serve as spin-qubits;  evaluate the spin dynamics and decoherence times for optically-gated metal complexes to determine design principles for this class of spin-based qubits; and determine the effect of intermolecular interactions on PISCES processes, spin lifetimes and decoherence in nanostructured thin films and surfaces.

This collaboration between a synthetic inorganic chemist and inorganic spectroscopist seeks to provide new perspectives on the correlation of radical accumulation on main-group ligands towards base-metal C?H bond functionalization catalysis. Such information is critical to advancing both fundamental understanding as well as synthetic methodologies. The research involves the synthesis and characterization of novel metal-ligand multiple bonded (MLMB) systems that mimic biological monooxygenases that deliver diverse functionalities into C-H bond substrates.

These molecular materials comprise photo-active chemical groups that change shape when exposed to light. The light-driven molecular transformations cause the pores (holes) and channels in the crystals to change shape and dimension. This leads to the development of smart materials capable of selectively absorbing or releasing guest molecules, but only when exposed to the proper wavelength of light.

The research establishes much needed design principles to understand and enable the rational design of next-generation photo-responsive materials.

Given the importance of extending longevity in sustainable materials development, the proposed research also includes an effort to identify and understand the root causes of fatigue in these systems. The photochemical reactions in these materials, both desired and undesired, are precisely monitored through advanced spectroscopic and in situ X-ray diffraction methods.

Scalar curvature is the simplest curvature invariant of a Riemannian manifold. It represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. Scalar curvature also arises in natural sciences. For instance, in general relativity, it is the Lagrangian density of the Einstein-Hilbert action. A natural and deep question in geometry, topology and mathematical physics is to understand the affect of scalar curvature conditions on a manifold. The other main area of investigation concerns minimal surfaces. Minimal surfaces arise as the mathematical model of a number of interfaces in nature. In mathematical model of general relativity, minimal surfaces occur as ?apparent horizons? of black holes; soap films and capillary interfaces also provide examples of minimal surfaces. The PI will investigate the existence, regularity and topology of minimal surfaces. The two aspects proposed here are deeply connected via geometric variational theory.<br/><br/>The project concerns a range topics on differential geometry, geometric measure theory and partial differential equations. A main theme of the research in geometry will be a geometric comparison theorem for scalar curvature using Riemannian polyhedra, with the aim to define weak notions of positive scalar curvature on spaces with low regularity. The PI plans to continue his investigations into such a theorem for more general polytopes, especially simplexes of higher dimensions, and its connection to quasi-local mass in general relativity. The PI also plans to continue his investigation on the structure of moduli spaces of manifolds with positive scalar curvature and mean convex boundary, including studying its high homotopy groups, and the structure of moduli spaces defined by other related curvature conditions. In addition, the PI will study singular spaces with scalar curvature lower bounds, and understand when such a singular manifold arises as a certain limit of smooth manifolds with same assumptions. A central tool in the PI?s research is the theory of minimal varieties. The PI plans to understand the existence and regularity of minimal surfaces with free boundary and capillary boundary conditions in general Lipschitz domains, especially in locally convex polyhedral domains.

In recent decades, however, a great variety of noncoding roles for RNA molecules have been discovered, including in catalyzing chemical reactions, regulating gene expression, and in specialized functions such as CRISPR. To fulfill these roles, RNA takes up a wide variety of specific three-dimensional shapes and forms. Relatively little is known, however, about the formation of these three-dimensional RNA structures, leaving large gaps in the search for a predictive framework for the design of functional RNA molecules and of other molecules that target cellular RNAs. This project will carry out an integrated program of spectroscopic, biophysical, biochemical, and computational analyses in order to map out the energetics and folding pathways for RNA structures. The work will provide a full atomic-level description of the formation of an RNA three-dimensional structural interaction, and a scientific understanding of such RNA-RNA interactions in noncoding systems in general. This proposal will train underrepresented groups at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The PI?s efforts in mental-health awareness in the scientific workforce at regional and national conferences will be expanded.<br/><br/>Although the factors underlying secondary structure (helix formation) in DNA and RNA are relatively well understood, the detailed study of the driving forces and mechanisms of formation of complex RNA tertiary structures has not kept pace with the great recent advances in RNA structural biology. The docking transition in the hairpin ribozyme is a rare example of a tertiary-only interaction amenable to intermolecular biophysical and spectroscopic investigation, with a wealth of existing structural and functional data and multiple functional readouts. This project will use a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics computations to examine conformational sampling of the individual loops and use functional assays of dynamically-quenched variants to determine the relevance of the observed motional modes determined in each loop and derive internally-consistent models of docking-competent states.

The Loewner energy is a quantity measuring the roundness of a simple planar loop. It arises from the asymptotic behaviors of the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE), a model of random fractal curves. SLE plays a central role in random conformal geometry and two-dimensional statistical mechanics that study the macroscopic geometry of systems with given information on the microscopic level. Surprisingly, this probabilistically motivated Loewner energy can be described using fundamental concepts from seemingly disparate branches of mathematics and mathematical physics, including geometric function theory, Teichmüller theory, conformal field theory, and string theory. These links suggest deep connections between random conformal geometry and those branches. This research project aims at revealing these connections and exploring how the variety of perspectives around the Loewner energy can bring new insights to probability theory and other fields. The results are expected also to reveal new facets of the mathematical architecture underlying theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The Loewner energy of a Jordan curve is defined as the Dirichlet energy of its driving function via the Loewner differential equation. Finite energy curves can, therefore, be viewed as the Cameron-Martin space of SLE, which has a multiple of Brownian motion as driving function.  This definition of both Loewner energy and SLE depends strongly on the parametrization of the curves. However, an equivalent and intrinsic description of the Loewner energy was discovered using determinants of Laplacians and is known to be the Kähler potential of the Weil-Petersson metric on the universal Teichmüller space. This research project first aims to provide similar intrinsic descriptions of SLE loops via the canonical measures on the welding homeomorphisms, then studies generalizations of the Loewner energy to other scenarios involving multi-chords or higher genus surfaces, analytic identities inspired by results from random conformal geometry, and the relation to minimal surfaces in the hyperbolic 3-space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Brunn-Minkowski theory is at the heart of one of the core subjects that provides the mathematical and computational tools used in such applications. The core of the Brunn-Minkowski theory concerns the study of  types of geometric measurements (such as the surface area, volume, curvature of its boundary) of an object. Another central area are Minkowski problems, which ask whether an object can be reconstructed from a set of these geometric measurements. The investigators will continue their efforts to expand and enrich both of these central areas. They will also continue their work connecting ideas in information theory with Brunn-Minkowski theory.

These newly developed techniques (of the Investigators) of obtaining delicate estimates for integrals with respect to measures have led to the discovery (by the Investigators) that ""measure concentration"" is the key phenomenon displayed by solutions to those geometric characterization problems. Continuing these investigations should enable the Investigators to make significant progress on fundamental problems regarding characterizing geometric measures.

They are important for human health because they protect shorelines, and provide food and economic security for many coastal and island communities. Despite this great importance, coral reefs are under threat due to warming ocean waters. The coral animal consists of many cells including immune cells and gastrodermal cells. Gastrodermal cells have algae that live within them, and this symbiotic relationship is important to maintain coral health. When water temperature increases, coral bleaching occurs. The coral and algae stop living together. During bleaching the coral?s immune system is compromised making it more likely for it to get sick and die.  Thus, this research aims to understand how the immune system of corals responds to heat. This research is important for the bioeconomy: if it is known how corals defend against disease, then this information could be used to make diagnostic tools to identify sick corals.  We could also create therapeutics to help save corals.  These tools would protect coral reefs, which would protect shorelines, and provide food and economic security for coastal communities in the USA.

An ecologically important example of this exists in stony corals. While also maintaining a beneficial relationship with an endosymbiotic alga, Symbiodiniaceae, stony coral innate immune system must also identify potential pathogens. The scientific community lacks information on the plasticity and function of the coral cells responsible for the innate immune reaction, and/or the cells responsible for symbiosis. The overall goal of this grant is to apply a unique approach, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to determine the function of immune cells and Symbiodiniaceae-interacting cell populations in heat stressed and control conditions. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that corals possess specialized populations of immune cells unique from the cells which engulf the Symbiodiniaceae. Using FACS and RNA sequencing, this international team will determine the morphology and gene expression of isolated coral cell populations under control and heat stress conditions. Determine what the function of immune cells during control and heat stress conditions and determine the source of the immune signal during heat stress induced bleaching.

Due to  ongoing NSF support,   gravitational wave observations   now accumulate at an ever-increasing pace.  Previously unidentified sources are and will be uncovered.  Some, like merging neutron stars, can produce associated and distinctive electromagnetic emission.  These new sources and populations may push the frontiers of what we predict can happen, or challenge our capability to interpret what did happen.   The physical parameters of individual sources can be estimated from observed signals based on approximate predictions of their gravitational wave and/or electromagnetic emission.  Likewise, the physics responsible for an individual source or collection of sources can be deduced from their distinctive or well-measured collective properties, based on models for how they form.   The goal of this project is to help produce and interpret this new cosmic census, rapidly and reliably identifying new events and populations to inform follow-up observations and modeling.<br/><br/>This project has two major activities designed to enable multimessenger observations of GW sources to achieve their immense potential.  First, the group will construct and operate high-cadence, low-latency parameter and population inference codes for gravitational wave sources.  Principally created for interpreting LIGO's concrete observations, the group will also use these codes to assess and mitigate how much astrophysical conclusions depend on key uncertainties: the presence of matter (versus vacuum); the accuracy of our approximations to general relativity; and the significance of each source, given data quality.  Second, the team will develop and employ new phenomenological methods with which to interpret the cosmic multimessenger census, emphasizing  physically-parameterized and generative approaches based on detailed physical models. One long-term goal of this project is to help assemble the necessary framework  for the  discovery and interpretation of new high-impact populations, including high-mass and high-mass-ratio binaries; binary neutron stars; neutron star/black hole binaries; and  more exotic populations with distinctive observable signatures in their physical parameters. The group will deliver infrastructure to support rapid parameter estimation and source classification to inform multimessenger followup observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This belief is implicated in lowering girls? sense of their own STEM abilities, their feelings of belonging in STEM classes, and their interest in pursuing further education in STEM fields. The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, the University of Texas, Austin, and New York University is to answer important questions about how to teach genetics at the high school level in a manner that is scientifically accurate, but does not have these detrimental side effects. Specifically, this new line of experimental research will identify?and revise?the content in common genetics instruction that promotes the belief in neurogenetic essentialism. The proposed experiments will also explore how the beliefs of peers and teachers contribute to changes in such beliefs in students. This work has further implications for how the topic of differences between men and women is addressed during high school biology education. Furthermore, the research findings will advance theory on factors that contribute to gender disparities in STEM attitudes and aspirations. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, with co-funding by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK12) program. <br/><br/>Building on preliminary evidence, this project aims to accomplish four key goals. First, the project will study which specific aspects of genetics instruction affect students? beliefs in neurogenetic essentialism. Second, the project will identify the cognitive mechanisms through which these effects occur. Third, the project will uncover the downstream effects of revised genetics instructional materials on a broad range of motivational variables relevant to STEM pursuit, such as implicit person theories, sense of belonging in STEM, and interest in this domain. Fourth, the project will explore the contextual factors (e.g., teacher and peer beliefs) that may moderate or mediate how students respond to the instructional materials. The research team will develop and iteratively refine genetics educational materialsthat teach about genetic, neurological, and behavioral variation within and between sexes, as well as the social causes of such differences. The research team will then test the effectiveness of these revised materials through two large-scale randomized control trials, one targeting students directly and one targeting students? learning via their teachers.

While the chemical anchoring to the surface provides the required mechanical strength to the coating, the chemistry and structure of the polymer enables communication with the environment.  Hence, these coatings have broad relevance in  solving problems in materials science and in human health. They can act as sensors for rapid detection of biomarkers in biofluids when anchored to electronically active surfaces, direct cell growth for regenerative medicine, resist deposition of micro-organisms on surfaces, control flow of charge in batteries, control friction at relevant interfaces., etc. This research program will develop new synthetic methodologies to make these polymer brushes with well defined structure and chemistry. The methodology developed is high yielding, simple and reproducible on a wide range of surfaces, hence can be adapted by the coating industry. This program will develop characterization methods to aid in the molecular level understanding of the resulting structure.  The research program will serve to inspire and involve undergraduate students in polymer science and engineering research, by working with graduate student mentors, through the REU program. Educational modules will also be developed for dissemination through UW-Madison?s institute for Chemical Education, a national center dedicated to STEM education through outreach and education research.<br/><br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The research program will develop a highly versatile approach to grow mixed A/B polymer brushes from a substrate using a cross-linkable copolymer coating, which contains a polymerizable initiator (inimer) as a comonomer. Mixed A/B polymer brushes consist of chemically distinct A and B chains, randomly grafted to the surface. They show changing density, height and composition profile as a function of solvent environment. These polymer brushes will have high chain grafting density, uniform distribution of A and B graft points, controlled molecular weights, and excellent control over composition.  Theory predicts the lowering of critical point for phase separation in mixed brushes compared to block copolymers, and the formation of nanoscale morphology. However, experimental studies have fallen short of validating these predictions. The gap between theory and experiments is attributable to lack of: a) experimental methods for uniform growth of high grafting density mixed brushes with controllable grafting ratios, and predictable chain lengths, (b) accounting for chain end-groups in theory and experiments, and (c) characterization methods to study the morphology.  In this project the goal is to understand the role of chain-end density, size, distribution, and type on the A/B mixed brush morphology. This is a largely experimentally and theoretically unexplored area in polymer brushes. Key aspects of this research will be to develop synthetic strategies to append select chain end groups, quantification of the extent of functionalization and chain-end distribution by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Resonant Soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), and studying the effect of chain-end functionalization on lateral phase segregation by a combination of scattering and advanced microscopy techniques. The morphological insight developed through these experiments will contribute towards the broader understanding and application of polymer brushes.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These molecular materials comprise photo-active chemical groups that change shape when exposed to light. The light-driven molecular transformations cause the pores (holes) and channels in the crystals to change shape and dimension. This leads to the development of smart materials capable of selectively absorbing or releasing guest molecules, but only when exposed to the proper wavelength of light. Experiments using ultrafast pulses of light and/or X-rays reveal critical insights into the fundamental photochemistry that occurs in these novel materials. The research establishes much needed design principles to understand and enable the rational design of next-generation photo-responsive materials. The educational projects include the continuation of the U.S. Crystal Growing Competition, and a nation-wide crystal growing competition, that brings concepts of crystals and crystal growth into K-12 classrooms and home schools throughout the country by providing participants a fun and exciting hands-on STEM-based contest.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Integrating the photo-responsive properties of diarylethenes into hybrid crystalline systems transforms these traditionally passive materials into active materials that change their chemical or electronic properties in response to light stimulus. The PIs' innovative approach - using ring-closed diarylethene building units - ensures the reliable and predictable synthesis of photo-responsive crystalline materials. Given the importance of extending longevity in sustainable materials development, the proposed research also includes an effort to identify and understand the root causes of fatigue in these systems. The photochemical reactions in these materials, both desired and undesired, are precisely monitored through advanced spectroscopic and in situ X-ray diffraction methods. These experiments provide a crucial link between the molecular photochemistry and the photophysics of the proposed hybrid crystalline solids. It is anticipated that the design principles and experimental techniques developed through this collaborative research program can be extended to other photochromic systems.

Further advances of this area of research demand deepened knowledge of the behavior of such charged electrons after excitation with light. This excitation process is a complicated phenomenon consisting of a number of sequential processes, most of which happen within one billionth of a second. This research team controls the behavior of these hot electrons with other optical effects to understand the generation, transport, and decay of electrons. Moreover, the ultrafast behavior of optically induced hot electrons is harnessed for the all-optical control of light. The knowledge gained through this project lays the groundwork at the interface of semiconductors and optics, and leads to new insights into the design and implementation of devices for the detection and processing of light. This research, included with high school and collegiate education, promotes multidisciplinary thinking of the up-and-coming scientists and engineers. The project broadly disseminates interdisciplinary knowledge derived from this research effort, encourages early engagement of the youth via integration of research and education, and enhances the learning opportunities for high school students from minority groups.<br/><br/>The dynamics of plasmonically induced hot carriers is pivotal to a wide range of photophysical and photochemical processes. The current understanding is partially constrained by the capacities of prevailing characterization methods. Moreover, the fundamentals and applications of hot-carrier plasmonics are predominantly focused on the linear optical regime, while rather limited work has investigated the involvement of hot carriers in nonlinear light-matter interactions. This project aims to elucidate the dynamics of the generation, transfer, and thermalization of hot carriers via nonlinear optical means, and furthermore, to exploit hot-carrier induced nonlinear optical processes for signal detection and processing in photonic and quantum systems. The overall content of this research is to establish a new technique for the investigation and utilization of the ultrafast dynamics of hot carriers based on the second- and third-order nonlinear optical effects. Such novel nonlinear processes are explored in hybrid plasmonic platforms, where nanostructured metals interface electron-accepting materials. Of particular interest are the implementations of two hot-carrier induced phenomena, namely, the transient optical Kerr nonlinearity and the transient second-harmonic generation, for the investigation of hot-electron dynamics and the realization of ultrafast all-optical control of light. The successful execution of the research leads to new understanding of light-matter interactions at reduced dimensions, and facilitates improved understanding of hot-carrier physics, optical signal processing, and quantum transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many proteins, however, include parts where the structure is not well defined. The shape and thus the functions of these intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins are difficult study. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Dr. John Antos and Dr. Sergey Smirnov from Western Washington University to develop experimental methods to study the structures of IDRs. The research team is using use a splicing enzyme (sortase) to insert specific chemical tags into proteins that allow their shapes and changes to their shapes to be monitored by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  This project applies these methods to determine the key functional properties of dematin, a protein with a large IRD that helps control red blood cell shape and function. Results from these studies set the stage to study many types of IDRs in proteins that are prevalent across multiple kingdoms of life. The project prepares the next generation of scientists by training participating undergraduate and Masters level graduate students in state-of-the-art methods for analyzing protein structure and function. The project provides research opportunities to engage and attract underrepresented groups and high school students into the natural sciences. In addition, Drs. Antos and Smirnov incorporate authentic research experiences into Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) for biochemistry courses. <br/><br/>Approximately one-third of eukaryotic proteins contain within their polypeptide sequences sizable intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which are critical for a variety of cellular functions. Many of these IDRs are large (hundreds of residues), which makes the site-specific study of these dynamic protein segments and their binding interfaces technically challenging. For example, the application of NMR, one of the preferred methods for studying IDRs, is hampered by severe spectral overlap of resonances originating from large IDRs. Similarly, the targeted insertion of functional labels such as spectroscopic reporters or post-translational modifications is often impossible due to competing labeling of multiple identical sites in extended IDR sequences. This project addresses such problems via robust and efficient site-specific sortase-mediated ligation strategies tuned for large IDR-containing substrates. This includes the development of guidelines for the use of site-specific ligation strategies in the context of large IDR-containing protein substrates. The set of methods developed lead to the generation of derivatives of the erythrocyte-controlling protein dematin segmentally labeled with NMR-active isotopes (15N and 13C). Such derivatives enable characterization of a crucial regulatory intramolecular binding interface involving the large, 315-residue IDR that is central for dematin function and regulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

McMahon of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison investigates the behavior of organic compounds under extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, or radiation.  These conditions, which are similar to the conditions found in flames (combustion) or in space, cause the degradation of organic compounds and generate a complex mixture of highly reactive products.  This project explores the properties and chemical reactions of these reactive molecules.  This research provides a foundation for understanding two very different problems ? one involving combustion and another involving the chemistry of space.  Combustion of organic fuels is central to our nation?s energy supply and national economy.  A fundamental understanding of combustion offers the possibility of enhancing the energy efficiency of fuel combustion and minimizing pollutants (soot) that arise from incomplete combustion.  In interstellar space, it is now known that hundreds of different organic compounds exist throughout the galaxy in environments that are harsh because they are so hot (near stars) or because they are so cold (far from stars).  Studying these environments is a crucial step in understanding the distribution of organic material in the universe and identifying molecules that could be precursors to life.   This research program supports the education of graduate and undergraduate students in the study of complex chemical problems as part of an interdisciplinary research team.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia. Professor McMahon and his student engage in a variety of science education and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses challenges in mechanistic organic chemistry that are relevant to our understanding of harsh reaction environments.  The current proposal develops these issues along three major lines:  1) generation, detection, and characterization of key chemical targets by rotational spectroscopy, 2) spectroscopy and photochemistry of carbon-chain molecules, and 3) quantum mechanical tunneling in organic chemistry. The scientific impact of the proposed research reaches beyond chemistry and cuts across diverse areas of contemporary science.  Studies of spin delocalization and spin polarization underpin the development of new organic materials with novel electrical and magnetic properties.  Studies of reactive organic species contribute to a fundamental understanding of combustion.  The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), an NSF-funded astronomical interferometer of radio telescopes in northern Chile, is generating a deluge of new radio-astronomical data.  These data can be interpreted only by comparison with laboratory spectra of the type that are obtained in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This collaboration between a synthetic inorganic chemist and inorganic spectroscopist seeks to provide new perspectives on the correlation of radical accumulation on main-group ligands towards base-metal C?H bond functionalization catalysis. Such information is critical to advancing both fundamental understanding as well as synthetic methodologies. The research involves the synthesis and characterization of novel metal-ligand multiple bonded (MLMB) systems that mimic biological monooxygenases that deliver diverse functionalities into C-H bond substrates. The ability to selectively incorporate functionality into unactivated C-H bonds represents an advance in converting inexpensive chemical feedstocks (e.g. hydrocarbons) to value-added molecules (e.g., pharmaceutical precursors). To this end, Betley and Lancaster seek to synthesize MLMB complexes featuring N- and O-bearing functionalities to examine and harness their reaction chemistry. Betley and Lancaster propose to leverage N and O K-edge XAS as means to probe the sub-octet character of coordinated N- and O-based ligand donors and to quantify metal-ligand covalency in coordination complexes. These data will be used to rationalize periodic trends in the reactivity (nucleophilic vs. electrophilic) of MLMB complexes across the late first transition series.

Nevertheless, despite a century of investigation, researchers are still making fundamental discoveries in this field ? discoveries which lead to improved device performance, reduced manufacturing cost, or streamlined integration with other technologies. The project activity is based on the unexpected discovery by the research team that the fundamental properties of semiconductor materials stem directly from atomic-scale structural motifs, and not deviations from periodicity as is generally accepted. By shifting that viewpoint, it is possible to achieve a much larger range of parameter values than previously realized. The result is a completely new approach to selecting materials for specific applications. The project also incorporates development of outreach activities for both middle school children and teachers, involving the community directly in the project by investigating how artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques are applied to image recognition and data analysis, thereby helping to ensure a diverse and  motivated pool of young students for careers in science/technology/engineering/math (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>As part of a previous study on how cation disorder changes the band gap energy of the earth abundant element, sustainably-sourced ternary heterovalent semiconductor ZnSnN2, the research team has discovered the unexpected role played by structural motifs in determining this most fundamental of all semiconductor parameters. Carefully designed experiments indicate that it is not only possible to close the band gap of this material through systematic variation of the type and concentration of motifs that make up the lattice, but it is also possible to access ""negative"" band gap energies, corresponding to inverted bands. Further, preliminary evidence indicates that the same effect is possible in other compound semiconductors, including the commercially important InGaN family of materials, again through the action of structural motifs. The project investigates the full range of achievable band gap energies of both of these nitrogen-based material systems using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy based crystal growth in conjunction with a complementary suite of optical absorption, Hall effect and electron and x-ray diffraction techniques, with a view towards understanding the ramifications for charge carrier transport, optical properties, and ultimately material selection choices for devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic question is ""What do the frequencies of these waves tell us about their interference and vice versa?"". The interference of the waves has to do with the magnitude of their superposition, and the concentration of the interference can be made large by choosing the frequencies according to a strict pattern. One of the questions pursued by the PI is the converse: are these patterns necessary to achieve a very concentrated superposition. This is called the Inverse Littlewood Problem. The second question under investigation is an uncertainty principle. Suppose we have two families of waves that can be used to decompose a signal, and these two families are very incompatible. This incompatibility means we expect that a simple wave from one family looks much more complicated as a superposition from the second. A specific instance of this is whether a multiplicative character (a very simple wave in one family) can be decomposed as an additive convolution (a fairly simple superposition in another family). This is called Sarkozy's Problem.<br/><br/>There is a long history of comparing the distribution and arithmetic structure of sequences in number theory. Classically, the connection is observed by way of the Fourier transform. Towards a better understanding of this phenomenon, the PI plans to build upon recent results that relate the dimension of a finite subset of a lattice to estimates on the L^1-norm of its associated Fourier series. This area of investigation began with a conjecture of Littlewood on how small the L^1 -norm of the Fourier transform of a finite set of integers could be. The problem was resolved independently by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s. Recently, questions have turned to classifying the extremizers in this problem, and the PI has recently proved that they must be, in an appropriate sense, low-dimensional. In this project he will develop the method further, by weakening hypotheses and applying these results to problems in arithmetic reliant the L^1 norm. In the finite field setting, the PI and Petridis have made substantial progress on a problem of Sarkozy concerning sumsets and the quadratic residues. They have resolved the conjecture for almost all primes. The PI will develop the ideas further so as to resolve the conjecture in earnest. Beyond this, he will adapt the method to other problems, which in turn will lead to progress on Vinogradov?s conjecture on the least non-residue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These patterns can interact strongly with particular colors of light.  Fluorescent molecules are designed to give off certain colors of light, and are used to mark specific molecules and proteins in biological applications.  A nanopatterned metal surface can be made such that its optical properties match a particular fluorescent molecule and enhance the light signal from the molecule. Fluorescent molecules can also transfer light from one molecule to another, and this transfer is extremely sensitive to the distance between molecules. Biologists have used this property to measure distances at the sub-nanometer scale.  The team will use the unique optical properties of arrays of gold wires hundreds of nanometers wide to enhance this transfer of energy. The result of this work will aid in the study of this energy transfer in photosynthesis and in applications such as improving light harvesting in organic solar cells. The team will be completely comprised of a diverse set of undergraduate students at Trinity University. The students will take a leading role in every aspect of the experiments, will present their finding at national scientific meetings, and will be co-authors on any publication resulting from this work. Equipment and experimental techniques from this project will be integrated into upper division lab courses, broadening the impact to additional students at Trinity University. <br/><br/>This project characterizes the photophysics of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) paired donor and acceptor fluorescent molecules near a gold nanograting. The optical properties of structured metal surfaces can be engineered to influence the fluorescence of nearby quantum emitters. Applying this to FRET has many potential advantages, including the ability to enhance the energy transfer rate and increasing the Forster radius of FRET pairs. Metal enhanced fluorescence results from two effects, an enhanced excitation rate of the fluorophores and a decrease in their excited state lifetime of the fluorophore arising from altering the local density of optical states (LDOS). The geometry of gratings uniquely allows these two mechanisms to be measured separately, providing greater insight to the photophysics of the system. Surface plasmon modes on gratings follow a dispersion relationship, allowing for a wide wavelength range of relatively narrow surface plasmon resonances covering both fluorophores? absorption and emission spectra using a single substrate.  Time-correlated single photon counting will be used to directly measure both the FRET energy transfer rate and efficiency as a function of surface plasmon wavelength.  DNA will be utilized to attach the donor and acceptor molecules to the nanogratings, allowing for precise spacing between donor and acceptor molecules with respect to each other as well as the nanograting surface. The results of these experiments will allow one to optimize the enhancement in FRET rate and efficiency, as well as directly measure any increase in the Forster radius.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AR is the ability of some bacteria to survive antibiotic treatment, a capability encoded by antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).  AR rates are increasing globally, with the US Centers for Disease Control estimating 35,000 related deaths in the US per year in 2019, compared to 23,000 deaths per year in 2013.  It is a grand challenge that calls for an interdisciplinary approach to combat its spread.  Efficient and effective surveillance is needed to pinpoint where ARGs are spreading among bacteria and to inform ways to stop their spread. Combining next generation DNA sequencing with CI for monitoring patterns in ARG detection WWTPs is a promising and novel way to achieve this.  WWTPs aggregate antibiotics excreted by all people in a community undergoing antibiotic therapy, as well as any AR bacteria or ARGs that are present on their skin or eliminated by them.  Identifying anomalies in ARG patterns in wastewater could help identify potential outbreaks before they occur, better inform clinical use of antibiotics, and improve treatment practices to prevent release of ARGs to rivers and streams. <br/><br/>The objectives of this research are to: (1) Develop and demonstrate the CI4-WARS system using DNA sequencing data and associated metadata collected from a local WWTP; (2) Develop new computational tools to identify ARG occurrence patterns  in the DNA sequencing data that indicate the risk of AR spreading and develop and apply new algorithms for identifying anomalies in these indicators that are indicative of emergence of new AR bacteria or outbreaks; and (3) Integrate the developed computational tools into CI4-WARS, establishing it as a one-stop service for surveying, evaluating, communicating, and reporting/alerting indicators of AR risk.

For example, a payment system is allowed to use credit card details during a transaction, but it should not retain any record of credit card details once the transaction is complete. The dynamic nature of security concerns makes it challenging to build, verify and debug applications with non-static information flow policies. Consequently, the information flow policies of many security-sensitive applications are currently either unspecified at all, or being treated in an ad-hoc manner, resulting in large trusted computing bases and many security bugs in real applications. <br/><br/><br/>This award investigates an integrated research and education plan designed to transform the way that programmers understand, specify, verify and debug non-static information flow policies.

The writing workshop provides individual hands-on guidance and mentoring for 25 junior researchers in statistics, biostatistics, and data science on how to write journal articles and research funding proposals. Junior researchers apply to the workshop by May 15 with a writing sample and are notified of acceptance no later than June 15 after pairing applicants with mentors and senior editors.<br/><br/><br/>The ability to write well is a critical but often short-changed component of the education of statisticians and data scientists. The inability to write well can hinder not only publication of a researcher's results but also grant proposals.

The 2020 and 2021 NISS writing workshops will consist of two parts. The Sunday tutorial is an all-day session that covers scientific writing, as well as how to organize a paper. The workshop will cover ethical issues, writing grant proposals, strategies for journal choice, effective use of graphics, and understanding and responding to reviewers' comments.  At the end of this session, participants will meet with their mentor who will have analyzed a paper the participant submitted prior to JSM.  The Tuesday session focuses on specific issues for improving a manuscript, especially useful for participants whose native language is not English.  It will include the writing process and details of grammar, sentence structure, and word choice.  A panel of successful senior researchers whose native language is not English will discuss their experiences with technical writing in English and its importance to their success. Previous workshops have been very successful with many workshop participants going on to become associate editors or co-editors of major statistical journals. Individuals from among the 109 graduates from 2007 to 2011, the first five years, have held at least 23 associate editorships and one co-editorship.

The Kenyon College LIGO group will develop and incorporate a full suite of equation of state models available not only to the collaboration, but also available to the broader scientific community who rely on these results for followup analyses. This award intimately involves undergraduates in LIGO research and supports a no-barrier-to-entry astronomy research program that can recruit and bridge students into important LIGO research.<br/><br/>This award focusses on four types of equation of state models that will be used for parameter estimation: 1) piecewise polytopic models, 2) spectral decompositions of the adiabatic index, 3) models with built-in sharp, first-order phase transitions, and 4) models with nuclear physics parameters. Polytropic and spectral decomposition models have already been incorporated into lalsuite, which is LIGO?s algorithm library. However, they still require important development to make them more robust, which are great projects for training young undergraduates for more substantial research. Models with phase transitions and nuclear physics parameters have not yet been incorporated into lalsuite and will require a lot of development to get working seamlessly with the collaboration?s flagship parameter estimation software. Both sets of projects, though varying in required development, are essential additions for interpreting the physics of neutron star interiors.  These projects could potentially lead to conclusive evidence of a first-order phase transition in the neutron star equation of state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells utilize local environmental cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM), adhesive molecules, and local stiffness to make decisions about growth and movement. The process of converting mechanical stimulus to electrical energy at the ECM is commonly thought to act via adhesion proteins such as integrins. Emerging research on Piezo ion channels reveals that these channels can also respond to changes in the substrate mechanical properties. Therefore, these channels may serve as additional force sensors. This work will explore the role of a novel cell sensor, called Piezo1, in detecting ECM forces. The results may ultimately impact on human health. For example, the body?s mishandling of these mechanical signals results in a variety of diseases, including chronic kidney disease and cancer. The results of this work may lead to new types of treatment for these conditions.  The outcome has the potential to be broadly applicable, since Piezo1 is found in many cell types and organs where the mechanical environment plays a major role in proper function. The research findings will be integrated into outreach activities through an Education through Experimentation (E2E) platform that involves graduate, undergraduate, and local high school students in this project.<br/><br/>The project is based on the hypothesis that Piezo1 is the primary force sensor in epithelial cells, and that it detects the substrate mechanical cues translated into membrane tension. This occurs through a feedforward mechanism: local tension activates Piezo1 channels and calcium influx, which stimulates calcium-dependent contractility and cell spreading; the changes in cell geometry in turn, promote more Piezo1 activity and the migration of Piezo1 to regions under stress, causing further growth in the same direction. This hypothesis will be tested with substrate modulation as mechanical stimulus, a FRET-based fluorescent probe to report opening transitions in Piezo1, and a wound healing assay to screen cell mobility. There are three primary objectives. First, to identify ECM force sensors in cells by inhibiting Piezo1 activity and by knockdown of Piezo1. Second, to investigate how substrates alter Piezo1 responsiveness by visualizing the location and opening of channels during cell reshaping. Third, to test the hypothesis that functional Piezo1 expression level determines the identity of leader cells guiding collective cell migration. Taken together, the results of this work have the potential to transform our understanding of the mechanisms of various disease states that affect epithelial cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is the study of spatial structures (e.g. the surface of a donut, the large-scale shape of the cosmos, a tangled strand of DNA, a cluster of points in a massive data set), while algebraic geometry studies the mathematics of the ubiquitous polynomial equation. These disciplines have many and diverse points of contact; the principal investigator will study one in particular: families of Riemann surfaces. A surface is a topological object like the two-dimensional surface of a coffee cup, possibly one with lots of extra handles. A Riemann surface gives a special way of describing such an object as the solution to a polynomial equation, much as we learn in high school algebra that some equations describe circles, others ellipses, and others far more complicated shapes. A family of Riemann surfaces arises by varying the equations used to define the Riemann surface - one can imagine ""turning a knob"" to stretch and distort the shapes of the surfaces. Families of Riemann surfaces arise in many parts of mathematics and also play an important role in theoretical physics. The principal investigator will apply tools from topology and the related discipline of geometric group theory in order to better understand some of the most important families of Riemann surfaces that mathematicians today are interested in. Broader impacts include the establishment of a new chapter of the national Directed Reading Project network.<br/><br/>The project has two components. The first will investigate the topology of strata of Abelian differentials (translation surfaces). These families have been intensively studied by dynamicists and geometers, but there are foundational topological questions that still remain. In particular, the (orbifold) fundamental groups of strata are still highly mysterious. This can be effectively probed by way of the monodromy representation, a map into the mapping class group. The principal investigator will continue his work describing these monodromy representations, and will develop new tools to understand the monodromy kernel and so further develop the theory of fundamental groups of strata. Central to this endeavor will be an elucidation of the precise relationship between Artin groups and fundamental groups of strata. The second component of this project concerns families constructed via branched covers. These families have served as an important source of examples in topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory. The principal investigator will investigate the monodromy of these families with the objective of further synthesizing the topological aspects (braid groups, mapping class groups) with the algebraic (arithmetic groups and generalizations, Burau-like representations, primitive homology).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations and related mathematical structures. Classically one associates with such geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) the set of algebraic functions on them which forms a commutative ring (i.e., functions can be added and multiplied). Modern research involves more sophisticated algebraic structures associated with algebraic varieties, such as the category of coherent sheaves (the notion of a category is a generalization of that of an associative ring). One part of the project is to establish some cases of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture which identifies categories appearing in geometry in two seemingly unrelated contexts. Another part of the project aims to give a rigorous mathematical foundation to some aspects of the use of super Riemann surfaces (a generalization of the usual surfaces) in string theory. This project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the first part of the project is on homological mirror symmetry for symmetric powers of punctured spheres. The goal is to identify categorical resolutions of derived categories of coherent sheaves on certain algebraic varieties with partially wrapped Fukaya categories of the symmetric powers of punctured spheres.

The second part is to work out a generalization of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch formula to the categories of matrix factorizations over non-affine varieties and stacks. The PI also would like to use categories of matrix factorizations to find a Landau-Ginzburg counterpart of the G-equivariant Gromov-Witten theory. The third part of the project is to realize trigonometric solutions of the associative Yang-Baxter equation in terms of noncommutative orders over nodal cubics. The fourth part is related to the geometry of stable supercurves.

Whether trees thrive or falter during drought depends on how they respond to these stressful conditions. Despite many studies of leaf-level changes to photosynthesis and water use during drought, it is still unclear how trees make integrated and coordinated changes at the scale of the entire plant. For example, trees that change the angles of their leaves can reduce the radiation load at different levels of the canopy, reducing heat stress and water loss. This study investigates the coordinated adjustments of tree canopy structure and physiology under water stress using drought experiments in both growth chambers and in a forest that has a rainfall removal experiment. The investigators bring together traditional measurements of leaf and canopy gas exchange with novel remote sensing techniques that measure canopy structure and physiology. This project will provide interdisciplinary teaching, training, and learning experiences by collaborating with a non-profit organization (Math4Science) that promotes STEM, creating videos of 3D forests, mentoring undergraduate students, and exposing K-12 students from under-represented groups to STEM research.<br/><br/>The degree to which forests will continue to serve as carbon sinks and mitigate climate change hinges on whether trees can make physiological and structural adjustments to cope with changing environmental stressors. Most research to date on tree responses to drought has focused on how trees alter leaf-level physiology, phenology, and carbon mobilization and allocation. However, trees also make structural adjustments in response to drought (e.g., by changing leaf angles) to reduce radiation load and leaf temperature. The work extends current research on plant water use strategies, which is mostly focused on physiological responses at the leaf or ecosystem scales, to a new dimension - canopy structure (leaf angles). The investigators aim to answer the question ""To what extent do trees respond to water stress through coordinated adjustments of canopy structure and leaf physiology, and by what mechanisms?"" combining measurements of leaf and canopy gas exchange with novel remote sensing techniques that measure canopy structure and leaf physiology, including the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and the Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV). By taking advantage of both classical and novel techniques, this project will provide new insights into the coordination of plant response to water stress over spatial (leaf to canopy) and temporal scales (short to long term). Including mechanical responses in physiological studies of drought at the scales of entire tree crowns will provide novel mechanistic insights into drought-science and will facilitate building comprehensive mechanistic approaches into ecosystem-scale models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, the study of Laplace eigenfunctions is a fast developing field which lies on the intersection of the theory of partial differential equations, differential geometry, and spectral theory. Numerous connections to other areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, ergodic theory and number theory make this field attractive to researches with various backgrounds. The principal investigator (PI) plans to continue working on a number of longstanding problems on behavior of Laplace eigenfunctions on compact manifolds and solutions to elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs), using local techniques and methods that already led to a number of interesting results. One of those is called quantitative unique continuation. The PI's research on quantitative properties of solutions of elliptic PDEs has numerous applications in other areas of mathematics, including nodal geometry, geometric measure theory, and mathematical physics. A number of research problems for current and prospective graduate students are formulated in the project. The PI is active in disseminating the results obtained as part of this project through series of lectures and mini-courses. One of the goals of the project is to support activities that introduce junior researchers with various backgrounds to the theory of Laplace eigenfunctions. The PI is committed to encouraging full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, promoting diversity in academia. <br/> <br/>Recent progress in the understanding of the behavior of the doubling index of harmonic functions and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator led to a proof of Nadirashvili's conjecture and a partial solution of Yau's conjecture. The PI will continue to collaborate with A. Logunov on problems related to Yau's conjecture. In particular, they plan to study the nodal sets of the Dirichlet-Laplace eigenfunctions on domains on manifolds with smooth Riemannian metric and on surfaces with smooth metric. In many questions, Laplace eigenfunctions behave as polynomials of a corresponding power. For example, Donnelly and Fefferman proved that the vanishing order of an eigenfunction is bounded by a multiple of the square root of the eigenvalue. The PI and A. Logunov showed that the BMO norm of the logarithm of an eigenfunction is bounded by the same quantity. The PI will continue to study this analogy; one of the open problems is to obtain dimension-free Bernstein's inequalities for eigenfunctions, generalizing results of Donnelly and Fefferman. Local methods developed to study eigenfunctions are connected to more general problems on the properties of solutions of second order PDE. The PI plans to continue this research, first addressing questions of quantitative propagation of smallness for the gradients of solutions. Another goal of the project is to study the order of vanishing of solutions to Schrodinger's equation with bounded potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials are promising candidates for making devices for storing energy such as lithium-ion batteries and for converting energy such as solar cells. However, their efficiency has been fundamentally limited by the slow movement of negative and positive charges in them, restricting their use in practical applications. The main reason for the restricted movement of these charges is that they get trapped by the distortions in the materials? atomic structure. This project will investigate the use of dopants to improve the mobility of the charges in iron oxide, a representative of these transition metal oxides. It will determine the design principles of ?good? dopants that improve the transport of charges in these oxides so that they can be used in practical energy applications.

This project will initially use hematite, a representative polaronic oxide, doped with tin and other 4+/5+ ions as a model system for the study. The dopant clustering is believed to be due to ionic size mismatch, and consequently limit the carrier conductivity. The research team will use a ?co-doping? strategy to improve the solubility of dopants and avoid clustering and correspondingly enhance carrier mobility as a function of doping concentration. A crucial step in this project is determining the local environment about extrinsic dopants and dopant clusters and if/how they are modified when the second dopants are incorporated; this work will combine physical measurements with first-principles simulations. The findings in this project can provide rules for rational design of polaronic oxides with improved transport properties, and more importantly, develop a fundamental understanding of key factors determining whether an isolated dopant, dopant cluster or co-doping can be beneficial or harmful for transport properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, high-speed and accurate DNA methylation detection in nanopores still lags behind. This is attributed to an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) resulting from the inherent large electrical capacitive noise from the conductive silicon (Si) and also the complex DNA dynamic interaction with nanopore surface.  This project proposes a multidisciplinary research plan to address the fundamental challenges in high-speed and low-noise biomolecular sensing in a solid-state nanopore device. The new design combines electrical and optical sensing on a single sensor platform to improve the sensing accuracy. It utilizes crystalline sapphire as an insulating substrate and integrates large-bandgap titanium oxide thin film as the sensing element to minimize both the electronic and optical noise. The demonstration of DNA methylation detection will prove the feasibility of our TiO2/sapphire nanopore sensors in detecting complex molecular structures that will have broad impact on molecular marker detection and molecule-molecule interactions. The educational objectives are to promote electronic nanosensors related engineering education to undergraduate and graduate students, and to better prepare them as future innovators to transform nanobiotechnologies. The outreach objectives are to promote public awareness of the importance of nanosensors in health care and to attract the participation of K-12 students and underrepresented individuals in STEM careers.<br/><br/>This research is to fill the knowledge gap in nanopore sensing research by creating a significantly improved nanopore sensor platform that integrates low-optical background titanium oxide membranes on low-capacitance and hence low-electrical-noise sapphire. The research team will fabricate small and thin TiO2 membranes on sapphire, establish high-throughput manufacturing methods for both membrane formation and nanopore drilling, perform single-molecule DNA translocation, study the DNA-nanopore interaction, and analyze the data for methylation detection. The proposed sensor platform has a number of key features to support the development of a wide variety of emerging biomolecular diagnostic technologies. First, the creation of ultrasmall (<10 ?m) dielectric membranes on insulating sapphire eliminates substrate conductance, and drastically minimizes the chip capacitance to a few picoFarads even for high-dielectric-constant and ultrathin (<5 nm) TiO2 devices, thus significantly reducing the background high-frequency electrical noise and markedly improving high-bandwidth sensing. Further, both membrane formation and nanopore drilling will be achieved by high-throughput manufacturing methods, i.e. wafer-scale and batch-processing compatible sapphire etching and direct laser drilling, thus enabling low-cost and repeatable production. The scalably manufactured, low-noise, high-sensitivity nanopores will facilitate high-resolution gene identification and quantitation of their methylation status in a single measurement and at a greatly reduced cost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by developing new lab modules based on industry-recognized skills for each course in the biology major sequence.  Students will be able to earn badges that certify their mastery of each workforce-relevant skill. Accumulation of badges will lead to Certificates of Completion, which will provide concise information about a student's proficiencies. This approach incorporates technician education into a traditional biology program that has a current focus on preparation of its graduates for transfer into four-year institutions.  By expanding the program focus to include preparation of students for technical careers, this approach is intended to address an important workforce need in the San Francisco Bay Area.  This new pathway is expected to open the biotechnology program to more students and to promote completion of the entire biology major sequence as students accumulate critical workforce skills. Because the college serves a large Latinx student population, this approach is likely to contribute to broadening participation in the biotechnology field. The project has the potential to provide a novel model that might be replicated by academic biology programs interested in meeting local workforce needs for biotechnology technicians.<br/> <br/>To achieve its goal of embedding relevant technician education into the biology program, the project will develop lab modules and badge requirements in collaboration with local biotechnology industry partners. With input from the advisory board and local industry surveys, the project has identified needed technical skills. These skills, such as micropipetting, DNA and protein extraction and purification, and enzyme-linked immunoassay, will be the foundation of the modules and badges. The lab modules will become part of each course, thereby ensuring that all students develop biotechnology skills. Although the badges will not be required, they will be strongly recommended, especially for students considering temporary or career-long work as technicians in the local workforce. Badging will support many students by providing a pathway of incremental and achievable steps embedded in course completion. Pairing badges with in-class career-development activities and providing industry examples (through speaker series and other events) will provide a new, clear career pathway into biotechnology within the existing biology major. In addition to developing the labs and badges, the project will support technician-level biotechnology education with targeted recruiting at the college and the local high schools, and by collaborating with employers to secure paid internships and job placements.

This belief is implicated in lowering girls? sense of their own STEM abilities, their feelings of belonging in STEM classes, and their interest in pursuing further education in STEM fields. The goal of this project, led by a team of researchers at Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, the University of Texas, Austin, and New York University is to answer important questions about how to teach genetics at the high school level in a manner that is scientifically accurate, but does not have these detrimental side effects. Specifically, this new line of experimental research will identify?and revise?the content in common genetics instruction that promotes the belief in neurogenetic essentialism. The proposed experiments will also explore how the beliefs of peers and teachers contribute to changes in such beliefs in students. This work has further implications for how the topic of differences between men and women is addressed during high school biology education. Furthermore, the research findings will advance theory on factors that contribute to gender disparities in STEM attitudes and aspirations. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning, with co-funding by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK12) program. <br/><br/>Building on preliminary evidence, this project aims to accomplish four key goals. First, the project will study which specific aspects of genetics instruction affect students? beliefs in neurogenetic essentialism. Second, the project will identify the cognitive mechanisms through which these effects occur. Third, the project will uncover the downstream effects of revised genetics instructional materials on a broad range of motivational variables relevant to STEM pursuit, such as implicit person theories, sense of belonging in STEM, and interest in this domain. Fourth, the project will explore the contextual factors (e.g., teacher and peer beliefs) that may moderate or mediate how students respond to the instructional materials. The research team will develop and iteratively refine genetics educational materialsthat teach about genetic, neurological, and behavioral variation within and between sexes, as well as the social causes of such differences. The research team will then test the effectiveness of these revised materials through two large-scale randomized control trials, one targeting students directly and one targeting students? learning via their teachers. The results of this project will produce generalizable knowledge regarding the cognitive, sociological, and educational factors that contribute to STEM gender disparities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dynamical systems are mathematical models for physical processes such as the motion of the planets in the solar system. One basic goal is to understand periodic orbits; these correspond to repeating behavior such as a single planet revolving around a star. In particular, for a given dynamical system, it is important to understand how many periodic orbits exist, and whether or not a random configuration is close to a periodic one. The principal investigator will also study related questions about the existence of symplectic embeddings; these are mathematical transformations that can be used to relate different dynamical systems to each other.<br/><br/>In order to study these kinds of dynamical questions, mathematical tools will be developed in the theory of embedded contact homology (ECH) of three-manifolds, and other kinds of contact homology in higher dimensions. The foundations of ECH will be extended to the case of Morse-Bott contact forms. ECH of unit cotangent bundles will be studied and related to string topology. Spectral invariants in periodic Floer homology (a variant of ECH) will be developed and used to study whether or not generic area-preserving maps of surfaces have dense periodic orbits. Cobordism maps on ECH will be used to study Lagrangian embeddings in four-manifolds, and to investigate generalizations of the Arnold chord conjecture on the existence of Reeb trajectories with ends on a given Legendrian knot. Nonequivariant and equivariant contact homology will be studied in three and higher dimensions. Symplectic capacities arising from these different kinds of contact homologies will be compared. Combinatorial Reeb dynamics on polytopes will be developed and used to perform computer experiments to test Viterbo's conjecture and other related conjectures about Reeb dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meanwhile, GPGPUs are also quickly becoming an essential part of data centers around the globe. The number of data centers are growing drastically due to the recent explosion of social networking, movie streaming, online shopping, big data, internet of things, etc.  With hundreds or thousands of cores running in each GPGPU, severe heating is a serious challenge which   can significantly degrade GPGPU performance, reliability and energy efficiency unless effective cooling is employed.  However, effective cooling of data centers requires enormous expenditure of energy.  To ease all these problems, effective thermal management and thermal-aware task scheduling for GPGPU operation are needed, which however requires an accurate simulation tool that is able to offer efficient dynamic thermal prediction with a reasonable spatial resolution.   Currently, there is a lack of thermal simulation tools that offer high efficiency and accuracy with a reasonable resolution. The proposed work aims to develop an efficient simulation methodology based on a reduced learning algorithm that is capable of predicting accurate dynamic temperature distributions with a high resolution in GPGPUs.  With this novel approach implemented in GPGPUs, effective thermal management and task scheduling will become possible and will improve GPGPU performance and reliability.  This will also improve energy savings in cooling, computing and streaming and minimize the earth?s environmental stress.  This project will also contribute to interdisciplinary workforce training and prepare students for the emerging challenge of heating problems in GPGPU computing. Research related to the proposed work will be integrated into several courses taught by the PIs. Course projects will be developed by the Ph.D. and undergraduate students working on the proposed work. This will offer undergraduate and graduate students a useful learning experience beyond the textbooks and lectures. The PIs will also expand and integrate several ongoing activities to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM, e.g. through the Co-PI's NSF REU site. A special effort will be made to recruit and mentor Native Americans from an Indian Reservation near the PI?s university to join STEM activities and to pursue their careers in STEM.<br/>The goal of this project is to develop a multi-block simulation methodology for efficient, accurate prediction of dynamic thermal profiles of GPGPUs derived from a reduced learning algorithm. To reduce simulation space and thus the computational time while maintaining accurate thermal solution, the domain structure of a GPGPU is projected onto a functional space described by a set of basis functions obtained from the reduced learning method.  This projection learning process however requires collection of massive amounts of thermal data for the entire GPGPU and is computationally prohibitive. Domain decomposition is therefore applied to partition the GPGPU domain into hundreds of smaller generic building blocks. This building-block approach enables more efficient training of the basis functions to develop the multi-block thermal model.  This methodology offers a reduction in the computational time by several orders of magnitude for thermal simulation of semiconductor chips, compared with the direct numerical simulation.  Currently, thermal simulations of GPGPUs rely on the efficient compact resistance-capacitance (RC) thermal model that provides poor resolution and inaccurate thermal profiles. It is expected that the developed thermal simulation model will be even more efficient than the compact RC model.  Also, the multi-block approach possesses a natural advantage of effective parallel computing. This project will implement the developed multi-block model in hundreds of cores in a GPGPU to perform parallel GPGPU computing that will further speed up the thermal simulation of GPGPUs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Guimond has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to study coastal high-latitude hydrology at Dalhousie University in collaboration with the Water Cycle Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey. Through field data collection and numerical modeling analyses, this research will investigate interactions between high-latitude groundwater reservoirs and the coastal ocean. In the Arctic and subarctic, water flow patterns and storage are rapidly changing due to pronounced atmospheric warming. Alterations in groundwater flow and aquifer-ocean connectivity due to permafrost thaw will have profound impacts on global climate and high-latitude coastal zones, including marine and freshwater resources. Coastal systems are particularly vulnerable to climate-induced change due to changes in sea level and sea ice in addition to permafrost distribution. The primary goal of this research is to identify the mechanisms mediating aquifer-ocean exchange in permafrost regions to better understand how these processes will be modified under changing climatic conditions. Results from this study will help inform water and marine-resource management and climate adaptation strategies for Indigenous communities and northern governments and identify where coastal water resources are most vulnerable to climate change-induced contamination mobilization.<br/><br/>The integrated field and modeling study undertaken by Dr. Guimond aims to unravel the feedbacks between climate change and aquifer-ocean exchange in high-latitude permafrost regions. Results will identify the factors influencing Arctic and subarctic submarine groundwater discharge and saltwater intrusion and characterize the spatial and temporal scales over which they occur, improving predictive capacity under changing climatic and hydrologic conditions. Results of this study will enhance our knowledge of 1) present-day rates of groundwater discharge to the ocean, 2) processes controlling aquifer-ocean exchange in permafrost-bound regions, and 3) aquifer-ocean exchange response to climate-induced change (e.g. permafrost thaw). The field portion of this study will be conducted in Sanikiluaq, Canada and in Cambridge Fjord, Baffin Island, Canada. A suite of hydrogeological and geochemical field tools and methods will be used to assess present-day conditions, such as conductivity, temperature, depth loggers and radium isotopes. Also, numerical, hydrological models with freeze-thaw, coupled surface-subsurface processes, and variable density capabilities will be used to expand understanding in space and time. The processes and mechanisms elucidated through this integrated study will promote development of new conceptual and quantitative models that predict feedbacks between climate-change driven permafrost thaw and land-sea water exchange in high-latitude coastal systems that can inform groundwater management policies.  The PI will help develop a cyber-seminar series as educational outreach to the broader geoscience community on climate-change driven issues in Arctic and subarctic regions.

For example, natural disasters initiate a myriad of human communications, data exchange, and situational assessments. It is crucial to quickly collect and analyze all of the relevant data, as life or death decisions may rest on the outcome. Hurricane Irma in 2017 caused the largest civil evacuation in Florida?s history and emphasizes two critical problems in emergency management: 1) pre-storm evacuation coordination; and 2) post-storm support for shelter-in-place locations. Disaster information integration and fusion technologies have the potential to deliver enhanced situational awareness tools across all sectors, enabling a more efficient, effective, and automated emergency management and recovery process. However, there is no discernible approach to identify and exploit the underlying patterns of each dataset while also minimizing possible drawbacks. This project aims to utilize multimodal data, such as text messages, images, videos, traffic information, and geo-referencing information, from various sources including social media, news, government announcements, and radio broadcasts. This work will investigate the analysis and fusion of this information to provide useful insights for aiding the decision-making process for both residents and government agencies. The goal is to develop new tools and technologies that can support emergency managers to better evaluate the effectiveness of disaster management policies such as evacuation. <br/><br/>The proposed research provides potential solutions to solve crucial information analysis challenges related to disaster information management while leveraging the team's previous work.

Children?s first mathematical skills, like counting and number estimation, are typically measured using tasks that require children to sustain attention. In some cases their knowledge of mathematics is intrinsically linked to attentional processes. For example, in counting, children must learn to attend selectively to each object in a set and do so in sequence. They must then say a different word for each object that is selected. Despite the importance of attention in these early mathematical skills, the precise role that it plays in supporting or constraining early mathematical development is not understood. The research described in this proposal will involve tasks that measure attention in conjunction with mathematical skills for individual children between 2 and 8 years of age in order to clarify the role that attention plays in early mathematics. It will help point to whether difficulties in some mathematical skills may be traceable to differences in underlying attentional systems. The researchers will recruit both high and low SES (socioeconomic status) children in order to understand whether SES differences in mathematical cognition may be traceable to these systems, thereby providing a necessary first-step in developing cognitively-based interventions which may improve achievement in these groups. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>Two of the most widely studied numerical skills, counting and approximate number estimation, depend on appropriately deploying attentional resources in order to arrive at a mental representation of quantity. However, many cognitive theories and experimental studies treat measurements of these abilities as reflecting purely numerical processes rather than being dependent on general cognitive resources like attention. This project aims to quantify and formally model the role that attention plays in counting and estimation, and to clarify the degree to which it accounts for individual differences in performance on mathematical tasks, thereby allowing further investigation of whether attentional limitations may constrain mathematical development across age and SES. This will have the potential to show, for example, how much of children?s protracted timeline in learning counting may be due to waiting for the underlying attentional system to develop. If successful, this work will further help suggest what kinds of interventions on non-numerical cognitive skills may have important implications for improving mathematical education or potentially STEM education more broadly. The researchers will also create an open dataset of eye-tracking trajectories as children engage in numerical tasks, create tools for analyzing eye-tracking data, and formalize accounts of how visual information processing may give rise to patterns observed in numerical cognition, like subitizing, Weber?s law, and numerical estimation biases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decades of study on subduction zones have provided insight into the overarching processes that produce the magmas erupted, how the erupted magmas are produced at individual volcanoes, and a number of related questions. Despite this progress, a complex and largely unsolved problem is the cause of ubiquitous and dramatic variations in the amount and composition of magmas that erupt at volcanoes within the same subduction zone. Do these reflect processes acting deep within the Earth?s mantle, or in the overlying crust? Addressing this problem has important implications for understanding magma production and volcanic hazards, as worldwide almost a billion people live at risk from volcanoes. There is also a potential for scientific breakthrough by utilizing the existing large data sets acquired from recent NSF investments such as the MARGINS, GeoPRISMS, and EarthScope programs. However, addressing the question has proven challenging to date in part because of a lack of critical data for some locations, but largely because of the lack of suitable tools and approaches that allow us to quantitatively synthesize and compare the existing large data sets. <br/><br/>Thus, this is a multidisciplinary study to conduct a quantitative comparison of existing large geophysical and compositional datasets at the spatial scales of the entire Cascades subduction zone, linked through sets of common intensive variables such as heat and density, to determine the primary drivers of intra-arc magmatic diversity. Building on a successful Proof of Concept project that demonstrates the promise of the approach (Till et al., 2019), the project will test hypotheses about the relative roles of mantle magmatic flux vs. crustal characteristics and crustal magma storage depths in producing variations in erupted compositions and fluxes, and in controlling the geophysical state of the crust along strike in the Quaternary Cascades arc. The project has the potential to transform our understanding of these important regions and will produce a number of important broader impacts including, catalyzing interdisciplinary collaborations between three PI?s at three institutions, producing expert datasets widely and easily available to the Earth Science community, supporting undergraduate experiential learning activities.

The quantum states or waves are described as solutions of partial differential equations and their properties are often determined by the properties of underlying classical (particle) systems. The subject has its origins in geometric optics (going back to the 17th century) and quantum mechanics (going back to the first half of the 20th century) but the numerical, experimental and mathematical advances provide a new range of challenges and research opportunities. For instance, quantum resonances, which in chemistry can describe transitional states in chemical reactions, are now more accessible experimentally, and mathematically, compared to the time when they were introduced. Quasinormal modes, which are an analogue of these resonances in general relativity now have a chance of being observed for the first time, thanks to the LIGO experiments. At the same time, the methods originally developed to study differential equations using insights from classical dynamics, are now successfully used to answer questions about chaotic systems or geometry of geodesics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Among the specific problems studied by the PI are: (1) distribution of scattering resonances for classically chaotic systems; (2) understand dynamical zeta function (generating function for periods of closed orbits in much the same way as the Riemann zeta function is a generating function of prime numbers); and (3) spectral problems arising in fluid mechanics, specifically in the formation of internal waves. The concrete problem about chaotic scattering concerns the existence of a spectral gap for any (hyperbolic) configuration of convex obstacles in the plane. Since the late 80s it was proposed in the mathematics and physics literature that the gap is determined by the ""topological pressure"" of the trapped reflected rays. Recent advances on the fractal uncertainty principle should imply that there always is a spectral gap. For dynamical zeta functions, one of the goals is to understand the Fried conjecture which proposes a relation between dynamical (value of the zeta function at 0), spectral and topological quantities (corresponding torsions) for general manifolds with chaotic flows. The microlocal tools developed, among others by the PI, are particularly promising here. Internal waves in fluids, theoretically described by spectral methods, have only been observed, in a controlled experiment, 25 years ago. The importance of viscosity and nonlinear effects (on both classical and wave level) is still to be fully understood. The PI and his collaborators made some advances here but many questions, such as the analysis of the physically relevant boundary value problems, remain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This documentation will enable the doctoral student to develop a wide-ranging grammatical description of the language, and to conduct analysis of the phonology and semantics of the language. Accessible, data-driven descriptions of the grammar of world languages allows linguists to make and evaluate theories and claims regarding the variation in form of human language, how languages change over time, and the historical relationships between different speech communities. The documentation of endangered languages which belong to small, isolated language families such as this language is a critical endeavor in linguistics as such languages contain many unique and undescribed grammatical features which can expand our understanding of the nature of human language.  Language documentation also permits minority and indigenous communities to create long-lasting representations of community knowledge and life ways, and to build a language infrastructure on which to base language revitalization and maintenance work. This project works closely with local teachers and language workers, building academic and technical capacity which will aid in the maintenance and institutionalization of the language which until now has suffered marginalization in society. <br/><br/>The doctoral student will conduct fieldwork with native speakers working to improve the quality of translation and annotation of existing texts and recordings of the language, as well as creating new video recordings with a wide range of participants. This improved and expanded documentary corpus will inform the student's dissertation, which consists of a reference grammar of the language in typological perspective, employing best practices in documentation-based language description. This language belongs to a language family which exhibits unique variations on a number of common traits of indigenous languages: highly synthetic and phonologically fusional verb morphology, extensive directional and associated motion systems, nominalization as the primary means of verbal subordination, and semantically complex means of indicating epistemic mood, evidentiality, and stance through grammaticalized systems. The doctoral student's dissertation will contribute to the regional typology of these languages, and will be sensitive to major topics of ongoing discussion in the regional linguistics literature, while also aiming to create a grammatical description that is of the broadest possible use and accessibility to language typologists and theorists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This motion represents the surface expression of the Earth?s heat loss by convection currents in the mantle. Thus, the history of plate motions provides fundamental insight into the internal operations of the planet. As a consequence of the changing polarity of the Earth?s magnetic field, magnetic isochrons on either side of spreading ridges can be identified and used to infer relative motions between two or more plates. Armed with a database of magnetic picks and additional constraints on convergence at subduction zones, scientists have produced reconstructions of global plate motions extending back over 200 million years. Yet, observations of ridge spreading and subduction convergence only constrain relative plate motions (RPM) not linked to the deep mantle.  In fact, deep mantle forces that propel tectonic plates and the sub-lithospheric deformation that slows them are best understood within the context of absolute plate motions (APM).  Most methods for determining APM use observed age progressions along linear island and seamount chains produced by a deep-seated mantle plume bringing hot materials to the surface.  If these plumes remain fixed in the mantle then it is possible to directly solve for the APM. However, evidence is mounting that the plumes themselves are also moving and thus do not represent the desired fixed reference frame.  A new method has been discovered that may solve for both absolute plate and plume motions simultaneously, and this project will develop this new method and calibrate it with the most comprehensive datasets on seamount chain geometry, age, paleomagnetic latitude, and more. An improved understanding of APMs has broad benefits for other studies of the Earth. It determines a framework for relating the surface to the mantle, which allows other geoscience data, such as geochemistry and seismology, to be linked. The project will train a student in plate kinematics and data analysis. Besides data and software products, the collaborating institutions will offer a joint plate tectonic seminar using remote guest speakers, with recordings made available as video podcasts on YouTube.<br/><br/><br/>Observed paleomagnetic anomalies interpreted as plume drift make modeling of APM challenging as direct observations of plume drift are lacking. Using plume drift predictions from mantle circulation models that broadly satisfy observed paleolatitudes has so far been the best approach for deriving APM over moving hotspots. Yet, uncertainties in mantle rheology, temperature, and initial conditions make such models nonunique. A new approach (plume-spotting) has been discovered to address this unresolved problem. It is demonstrated that age progressions along Pacific hotspot trails provide strong constraints on allowable plume motions, making it possible to derive models for relative plume drift from these data alone. Relative plume drifts are estimated from inter-hotspot distances derived from age progressions, but these lack a fixed reference point and azimuthal orientation. Interpolated paleolatitude histories for Hawaii and Louisville add further constraints on plume motion, yet one parameter remains unresolved: a longitude history shared by all plumes beneath the Pacific plate. Thus, it is possible to only resolve the motion of hotspots relative to an unknown longitudinal shift. Consequently, and per Euler?s theorem, resolved APM rotations are therefore corrupted by a corresponding rotation about the north pole. Yet, such APM models still satisfy the data, forcing the use of methods involving RPM as new constraints. One such method is ridge-spotting, a technique that uses RPM models to examine the viability of APM models. Ridge-spotting has reconstructed the Pacific-Farallon ridge since 80 Ma and implies northward migration and monotonic clockwise rotation of the ridge. Some APM models imply large rotations of the ridge system and exhibit intermittent erratic behaviors. These properties suggest ridge- and plume-spotting combined may yield an optimal data-driven APM. The new plume- and ridge-spotting methods will be developed to handle the inconsistencies and uncertainties of plate kinematic data and used to derive data-driven models of plume and plate motions. Hotspot trail age-progressions will be developed and inter-hotspot age-distance curves with confidence limits will be published; these data and paleolatitudes will be used in the plume-spotting inversion. Paleolatitudes uncertainties, true polar wander, and alternative paleomagnetic interpretations will be considered in a Bayesian inversion framework. APM models will be tested for compatibility with RPM models via the ridge-spotting method. Additional considerations, such as geodynamic limits on both plate and plume speeds, net lithospheric rotation, the proximity of plumes to LLSVP edges and plate boundaries, and overall model smoothness will add further constraints to produce a unique model of Pacific absolute plate and plume motions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although this technology was developed and used for plant improvement since the 1980s, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has numerous limitations.  Key among these is that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is limited to specific plant species and/or varieties of particular plant species.  Agrobacterium is a natural plant pathogen, and it therefore frequently elicits defense reactions from infected plants, causing tissue necrosis.  Such necrotic tissue cannot be genetically transformed.  Ensifer adhaerens is a bacterium related to Agrobacterium.  When supplied with the relevant genetic elements it can, like Agrobacterium, genetically transform plants.  Ensifer is not a pathogen and therefore fails to elicit necrotic plant defense responses.  However, Ensifer-mediated plant genetic transformation remains inefficient and cumbersome to perform in the average plant biology laboratory.  The work described in this project will develop an Ensifer-mediated plant genetic transformation system, greatly simplifying the use of Ensifer in the laboratory and improving the efficiency of Ensifer-mediated transformation.  The resulting system will greatly extend the host range for plant transformation, allowing for the genetic improvement of a wider range of crop species than that now permitted by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.  <br/><br/>Agrobacterium-mediated plant genetic transformation has been used for transformation of many plant species.  However, numerous plant species and cultivars/varieties remain highly recalcitrant to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, in part because they react with a necrotic defense response to Agrobacterium infection.  As a non-pathogen, the related bacterium Ensifer adhaerens does not elicit a strong plant defense response.  Ensifer can, with the appropriate genetic alterations, transform a wide spectrum of plant species.  A limitation to using Ensifer as an alternative to Agrobacterium is that the best Ensifer strain currently used for plant transformation, E. adhaerens OV14, is naturally resistant to many antibiotics commonly used to manipulate Agrobacterium. To develop Ensifer-mediated transformation, this project will first delete Ensifer genes responsible for kanamycin resistance. Once a kanamycin-sensitive strain is created, various virulence (vir) gene complements from different Agrobacterium strains will be introduced into it, including the trans-zeatin synthase (tzs) gene  that directs synthesis of cytokinins, that potentiates plant transformation susceptibility, and a virG mutant (N54D) allele that permits vir gene induction in the absence of phenolic compounds such as acetosyringone. These novel Ensifer strains harboring various vir gene complements will initially be compared to equivalent Agrobacterium strains for virulence on several model plant species, including Arabidopsis and tobacco. Finally, the transformation efficiency of the best Ensifer strains will be compared with equivalent Agrobacterium strains on various cultivars of two crop species: soybean (which is highly recalcitrant to AMT) and potato (many cultivars of which react to AMT with a necrotic response).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Community colleges are adept at meeting rapidly changing workforce needs such as this.  To this end, Delaware Technical Community College proposes to develop and incorporate CRISPR-based gene editing training into its biotechnology curriculum. This work will be done in collaboration with the Gene Editing Institute at ChristianaCare, a Delaware-based healthcare organization. The project also aims to provide workshops to train community college faculty across the nation in CRISPR-based gene editing techniques. The trained faculty can in turn educate large numbers of students about this gene editing technique, to better prepare students for the current biotechnology workforce. <br/><br/>This partnership combines the content expertise of staff at the Gene Editing Institute with that of faculty at Delaware Technical Community College to develop and implement a high impact CRISPR-based gene editing curriculum and to offer training workshops for faculty. The project includes engagement with industry partners and national experts in bioethics. The professional development workshops will enable participants to broaden biotechnology instruction related to CRISPR use, as well related ethical issues.  Through these activities, the project expects to serve nearly 100 bioscience students at Delaware Technical Community College and 90 community college faculty. The intention is to help students gain the knowledge and skills needed to contribute to a rapidly expanding field with a wide range of applications. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) continue to update and provide effective training in state-of-the-art gene editing techniques to prepare students in a two-year biotechnology program to enter bioscience careers or further education; (2) disseminate an advanced, current curriculum and model high impact teaching practices to community college instructors through three and five day gene editing workshops. The employability skills of graduates will be strengthened and broadened with the use of classroom activities that involve analysis and interpretation of bioinformatic data, technical oral presentations, understanding and evaluation of scientific literature, and group work as examples. As a result of these efforts, the project team expects to contribute to the national need for technicians who are skilled in gene editing technologies.

Molecular electronics aims at developing devices that will complement and eventually supersede current semiconductor technologies. Molecular transport junctions have unique advantages, due to their hybrid solid state-molecular nature and novel interface properties. The variety of possible combinations of molecules and electrodes also permits tailoring the transport properties. Electrically gating charge transport was key to the electronics revolution, but no mechanism currently exists to effectively gate molecular transport junctions. This project will address that gap through a systematic probe of the factors related to electric transport. This will improve the fundamental understanding of these novel devices and enable a new gating mechanism to control electric transport with an unprecedented level of control. This will allow for integration of specific functions into molecular junctions that will enable practical applications. These include bio-photonics and optoelectronic device such as solar cells and LEDs at the single molecule level. This project will train for undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary nanotechnologies that span physics, chemistry and engineering.

It will do so by examining the impact of a multigenerational mentorship environment designed to support persistence of undergraduate women of color in STEM.  This environment focuses on supporting student well-being and thriving. Women of color include women who identify as Black/African American, Latina, Asian American, and Indigenous.  This group remains significantly underrepresented at all levels of education in the physical sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This continued underrepresentation does not reflect limited academic capacity to excel in STEM, but instead appears to be driven by experiences that lower the sense of belonging in STEM.  More research is needed both to understand the psychological toll of persisting in an unwelcoming STEM environment, and to implement effective interventions. This project will examine efforts to transform STEM participation through creation of spaces (i.e. counterspaces) that holistically support the complex interplay of students? intersecting identities, including their STEM identities. Such counterspaces have the potential to shift deficit narratives to asset narratives and thus promote students? persistence and achievement. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of a counterspace on student persistence; 2) extend the application of this counterspace to a minority-serving institution and compare its effectiveness among women of color enrolled at an minority-serving institution and a predominantly white institution; 3) understand the ways in which an intentional and explicit focus on psychosocial wellbeing affects STEM persistence among women of color; and 4) examine the long-term impact of engagement in the counterspace on women of color, including on degree completion and entry into the STEM workforce. To achieve these goals, the project team will conduct a multi-methodological longitudinal research and evaluation study that includes both process and outcome metrics. This intersectional examination has the potential to advance knowledge and theory in three significant ways. First, these studies will add to the understanding of counterspaces, and the features of counterspaces that are supportive of women of color in STEM. Second, it will identify the similarities and differences in the experiences of women of color in different types of institutions and in both urban rural settings.

In these courses, many students feel uncomfortable asking questions. This reluctance is caused by issues such as a lack of confidence, fear of looking foolish, and discomfort with interrupting.  The reluctance to ask questions in class is more pronounced for students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. Accordingly, mitigating these classroom climate factors is considered critical to decreasing STEM college student attrition. A promising approach to increase student inquiry in large classes is to use in-class anonymous backchannels as a social layer to improve student classroom engagement. Backchannels are digital conversations, such as ?chat,? that occur during a class session and allow students to anonymously post questions. There is evidence that the use of a backchannel increases the frequency of questions posed and the range of students participating in classroom interactions. Thus far, however, the research has not connected the use of backchannels in classes to the broader goal of maintaining student STEM persistence. This research will obtain information about the effectiveness of backchannels as a teaching technique to improve STEM education for undergraduate students, determine whether the use of backchannels increases student STEM identity and persistence, and determine whether backchannel use differs for students traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Research will be conducted in coordination with a consortium of eleven universities that are working to improve foundational STEM courses through development of equitable and inclusive STEM curricula and teaching practices. Further dissemination will occur via a higher education video-platform company that can share lessons learned by the project with their client institutions.<br/> <br/>The proposed research is grounded in existing educational frameworks and is based on a model that includes potential mediators between backchannel availability and its influence on STEM identity and persistence. The mediators are based on Expectancy-Value Theory, Self-Determination Theory, and extensive studies of belonging, classroom questioning, and help seeking. Expectancy-Value Theory focuses on student efficacy, values, and the personal and social cost of asking questions, and is relevant to recent studies in the STEM education literature. Self-Determination Theory mediators are the basic needs of belonging and autonomy, the extent to which students feel that they belong to the class as well as the STEM discipline, and are especially important for underrepresented student populations. The extensive literature on student questioning and help seeking is critical since it has yet to be incorporated into backchannel research. This research will compare students? perceived help-seeking threat versus the perceived benefits of asking questions.

In the last five years, the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration has detected several gravitational wave signals from merging binary systems consisting of black holes and neutron stars. These observations are already yielding new insights into the assembly and evolution of stellar remnants in the Universe, which are currently limited by the low numbers of events. In this context, the award supports research that will push forward innovative methods to (a) understand and mitigate factors that limit the sensitivity of the searches, and (b) characterize the properties of the signals that are detected. This approach is complementary to hardware improvements that boost the sensitivity, and by helping to detect and characterize the faintest and most distant signals, will help maximize the scientific yield of the LIGO-VIRGO observations. The resultant rapid and robust understanding of the source properties will also help better guide subsequent observations. The program will also facilitate NSF?s long-term vision on expanding the gravitational wave community by developing broader expertise in analyzing the LIGO strain data, releasing more derived data products, engaging and involving local undergraduate and high school students in the research, and organizing a pedagogical workshop for the wider field. <br/><br/>The research plan has two components. The first aim is to characterize and better mitigate two systematics that have been proven to affect the noise background, and consequently affect the sensitivity of searches: very short time-scale glitches in the detector, which are known to be extremely localized in parameter space, and moderate to longer-term variations in the noise characteristics, which affect the precision on the recovered signal-to-noise ratios of events. These systematics have been previously identified, but with the expanded level of detail that would be achieved in this research, it is possible to develop simple measures to curb their impact that are natural extensions of existing methods (such as signal-quality vetos and re-weighted signal-to-noise ratios). The second aim is to improve existing parameter estimation pipelines to help rapidly and robustly infer the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of gravitational wave sources. The methods build on existing codes that exploit the frequency structure of the signals (i.e., the smooth behavior of their phase with frequency), and insights from the searches on how to insulate the detection process from localized instrumental artifacts, i.e., glitches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the proposed research will develop a statistical framework for generative learning, which is primarily motivated by applications for unstructured data, namely topic sentence generation and high-order hyperlink prediction. The research will develop powerful generative methods for generating instances or examples to describe and interpret the corresponding learning model.  Moreover, it will develop network models for modeling high-order interactions and relations of units by identifying hidden structures in networks. It will proceed in two areas: (1) instance generation and topic sentence generation; (2) hyperlink prediction for multiway relations in hypergraphs. In the first area, instance generation, particularly sentence generation, will be performed collaboratively with numerical embeddings in categorization and regression. In the second area, hyperlinks will be predicted based on observed pairwise as well as unobserved high-order relations, characterized by graphical models with hidden structures.

The virus lives on the surface of currently available PPE materials for many days. Recent evidence suggests that copper or copper zinc oxide composites with antimicrobial activity may inactivate virus. However, the mechanism for this is poorly understood at present. This project will test the hypothesis that PPE surfaces coated with copper or zinc oxide nanoparticles (NANO-PPE) will cause denaturation and degradation of viral biomolecules, thus leading to viral inactivation. The project sheds new insight into hybrid materials containing these biotic metals on the PPE surface, especially characterizing their interactions to biomaterials such as lipid, protein or RNA and the impact on structure-function. The RAPID project draws on several complementary areas of technology including, nanomaterial surface chemistry and processes, biophysics, biochemistry, and virology. This provides a unique interdisciplinary training environment for a diverse group of post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate students to engage in this cutting-edge research. Societal impact is that NANO-PPE stands to inactivate virus on contact, better protecting personnel from viral infection and thus limiting community spread, and long-term may help protect against other healthcare associated infections and drug resistant bacteria. This project is jointly funded by the  Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET)  Division and  the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The primary objective of this RAPID project is to gain a more fundamental understanding of nanoscale interactions of viral or viral-mimetic lipid, protein and RNA to PPE materials surface-coated with copper or copper/zinc oxide composites. The goals of the project are; 1) to fabricate PPE materials coated with copper and/or zinc oxide nanoparticles, mixtures and composites, 2) to characterize their nano-bio interactions and quantify the biomolecular denaturation and degradation caused by the nanoscale interaction, and 3) to place surrogate respiratory virus in contact with NANO-PPE and determine functional impact on viral titer and infectivity. Standard industrial scale processes such as electrospinning and deep coating will be used to coat the surface of PPE (face-mask, nitrile glove and surgical gown) with copper and zinc oxide nanoparticles. Surface interactions with the viral lipid, protein and RNA will be investigated by transmission electron microscopy, FT-IR, Raman/Photoluminescence, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Biomolecular denaturation and degradation will be quantified by 2-dimensional fluorescence difference spectroscopy, circular dichroism, gel electrophoresis, tryptic digestion and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Finally, viral titer and RT-PCR will be used to quantify impact of nanoscale interaction on biological activity.   Overall, the experiments will probe structure-functional impact of nanoscale interaction of virus and its inhibition by coming into contact with NANO-PPE. The project  will be integrated into a graduate class in Nanomedicine within a unit on nanoscale interactions and characterization methods and into the PI and co-PIs research programs involving undergraduate, masters, PhD and post-doctoral students.

This project will make available software for modeling with PDEs. It will also apply the code for simulations of complex groundwater flow processes in Hawaiian islands characterized by highly heterogeneous volcanic rocks and dynamic interaction between freshwater and seawater. Roughly half the population in the US lives near coastal areas where groundwater supplies much of the domestic, agricultural, and industrial water supply.  Almost all of Hawaii?s domestic water use is pumped from volcanic aquifer systems since the islands are completely surrounded by the Pacific Ocean. In Hawaii?s groundwater resources, freshwater accumulates on top of the denser underlying saltwater, making it highly susceptible to anthropogenic activities and saltwater intrusion induced by possible sea water and volcanic events. It is essential that Hawaii?s groundwater resources are properly modeled and managed for sustainable use. Island-scale numerical groundwater flow modeling with PDEs on HPC will play an important role in predicting the sustainable yields for the volcanic aquifer systems and planning groundwater resources management. The software in this project will be used both for applications and as a nexus for student involvement in HPC. Curriculum material associated with the project will be developed and offered at university level groundwater modeling classes.<br/> <br/>The PDE software developed, distributed, and applied in this project uses an innovative combination of advanced mathematical techniques for the solution of PDEs including parallel software tools to dynamically adapt the grids and special Lagrangian-flow methods that allow for solution of equations that can reproduce the sharp freshwater-seawater interface observed in sea water monitoring locations. The software is particularly appropriate for applications with equations that can be couched in a conservation law form. Source terms of these applications can be included using complex numerical techniques including the ability to handle anisotropic tensors components.The software is based on techniques of ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Methods) with AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement) to create a publicly available sustainable branch of the software known as PISALE for Pacific Island Structured-amr with ALE.

Its uses are broad: in batteries, in medication, in metallurgy and pyrotechnics, in nuclear power plants and weapons, in soaps and greases, etc. It is even a superconductor: when compressed, it carries electrical current without resistance. By being so light, lithium atoms display conspicuous quantum effects. For example, their quantum ?jiggling? makes the thermal expansion of lithium metal unusually high. It is interesting and important to understand lithium?s quantum behavior, to search for its novel manifestations, and to harness it for future use. This research focuses on nanoclusters particles of lithium: aggregates of tens to hundreds of atoms which can be size-selected with atom-by-atom accuracy. By studying such microscopic metallic droplets, the research team can precisely tune their properties and select the most promising quantum configurations. The project?s aim is to (i) explore in detail the thermal expansion of lithium; (ii) produce lithium nanoclusters which become magnetic when heated (this is unusual, especially since bulk lithium is nonmagnetic); and (iii) create nanoclusters which are simultaneously oblate and prolate in shape, a unique and purely quantum effect. The graduate and undergraduate students on the team receive training in a wide range of scientific and leadership skills. In addition, the subject matter is used for fruitful outreach programs.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>This project encompasses complementary experiments on size-, isotope-, and temperature-controlled metal nanocluster particles. It aims to reveal novel phenomena lying at the interface of nanoscale and quantum-solid behavior. The optimal material for this purpose is lithium, which displays distinctive behavior stemming from it being the lightest metallic element with the smallest electron core. Measurements on individual free particles make it possible to focus on the intrinsic properties of systems with a precisely defined size and composition and to trace the emergent physical properties from the nanoscale to the bulk. The research explores three inherently quantum phenomena: (i) Temperature, isotope mass, and cluster size dependences of thermal expansion as manifestations of the zero-point motion of ions at the nanoscale; (ii) The ability of nanoclusters to undergo quantum shape oscillations, i.e., to be in a linear superposition of two different shapes at the same time; and (iii) Temperature-induced magnetism in nanoclusters: the appearance of high-spin superparamagnetic states with increasing temperature. The experimental approach employs photoemission, photoabsorption, and Stern-Gerlach deflection of free nanoclusters. The results can serve as benchmarks for microscopic theories of electronic and lattice structure. Potential areas of applications include optical nanoelectronics, quantum sensing, and magnetic storage and detection. The project offers graduate student training in experimental and theoretical aspects of an inherently interdisciplinary field, encourages involvement by undergraduates, and serves as a fruitful resource for outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, current quantum computers based on superconductors, ions, or atoms are prone to error due to imperfections. The solution to this grand challenge is to use new, engineered materials which are inherently immune to these imperfections. However, key questions remain regarding how to make a material that integrates the demanding properties needed to achieve superior performance in a technologically relevant manner. The principal investigators have created a new method to make ultra-thin metals, and this project focuses on understanding the microscopic properties of such metals, specifically bismuth and lead. The investigators will evaluate the impact of thinning these materials down to just a few atoms thick to explore how their properties change when they are manipulated at the atomic-scale. Beyond the scientific impact, this collaborative project will provide interdisciplinary research training for underrepresented graduate students, to broaden participation in science and engineering programs. The project will also develop a unique industry/university consortium to impart the importance of safety in industrial and research settings. This will not only better train future scientists for post-graduate careers in industry, but will also improve safety preparedness in academia.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The creation of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) by reducing the dimensionality of a topological insulator from 3D to 2D could provide a unique, robust route to achieving topological superconductivity. This project will investigate the atomic-scale physical, chemical and electronic properties of 2D bismuth (Bi) and lead (Pb). Lead and bismuth exhibit very strong spin-orbit interactions, and exceptionally robust and easily accessible topological insulator properties that may enable the design of groundbreaking electronic devices with dissipationless spin currents, and the realization of Majorana bound states. Furthermore, these elements exhibit unconventional superconductivity, and could be combined with ferromagnetic materials, suggesting the possibility of creating a Pb-based topological superconductor. The investigators enable the study by synthesizing atomically thin, two-dimensional forms of these materials prepared via confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) ? a novel intercalation process that stabilizes 2D forms of 3D materials developed by the PIs. The SiC/graphene interface passivation is investigated before, during and after synthesis to understand how interface reconstruction can enable in-situ removal of the graphene cap for direct characterization access to the 2D-Bi and Pb.  Additionally, removing the graphene cap enables direct functionalization of the 2D metal to explore how modifying the surfaces of 2D-Bi and Pb changes their underlying physical properties, including bonding and electronic character. Finally, the project is developing a mechanistic understanding of how the structure and interfacial interactions with SiC and graphene impact electronic structure of 2D-Bi and 2D-Pb and elucidate how they differ from thin films deposited by traditional methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This influence is evident during El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Interannual ENSO variations in the tropical Pacific drive large shifts in global weather patterns, including regional rainfall extremes that can lead to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Decade-to-decade changes in the tropical Pacific also have large impacts on global climate, including the rate and pattern of global warming. Thus, to predict future changes in global climate and weather extremes we must know about the long-term state of the tropical Pacific and about changes in ENSO variability. However, the impacts of human activities since the start of the Industrial Revolution on conditions in the tropical Pacific are poorly known. This limits our ability to predict climate for the coming decades. Direct climate observations from the central equatorial Pacific are sparse prior to 1950, but this data gap can be filled by records of climate from geologic archives such as corals, tree rings, and ice cores. This project will use precisely dated coral records from the central equatorial Pacific to produce a record of ocean temperature since about 1800. This temperature record will be compared with climate model simulations to understand the observed trends and variability in ocean temperature, and their impact on climate. The project will support research by both graduate and undergraduate students. It will also develop outreach videos aimed at K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/><br/>The project aims to generate up to 20 new precisely-dated records of monthly-resolved sea-surface temperature and hydrological variability in the central tropical Pacific during the period from 1800-1950CE using paired oxygen isotope and trace element measurements in modern and fossil corals from Kiritimati Island (2N, 157W). The proposed work builds on the success of recent ""ensemble"" approaches to coral-based climate reconstruction that allow for the development of high-fidelity, monthly-resolved records tropical Pacific climate with explicit quantification of uncertainties, grounded in calibration of modern corals against instrumental climate records over recent decades. Moreover, the application of paired coral d18O and Sr/Ca analyses allows for the separate identification of temperature and hydrological trends over the last centuries - filling critical data gaps and allowing for detailed data-model intercomparison with advanced ocean state reanalyses products. The proposed work includes the application of a wide variety of strategies to assess the robustness of the coral-based climate records, including detailed analysis of sample preservation, as geochemical alteration can introduce significant artifacts into coral-based climate reconstructions if it goes undetected. If successful, the proposed work would provide a blueprint for the extension of the short instrumental climate record throughout the Pacific Ocean, utilizing samples from extensive coral rubble fields that are present on many ocean islands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, primarily of a geometric nature, and to use them to establish new instances of Langlands's conjectures. The award will support the training of students in this area of research that is considered of high interest.<br/><br/><br/>This project addresses the following fundamental question: what are the underlying geometric structures relating p-adic Galois representations to the mod p representation theory of p-adic groups? The project builds on several recent developments in which the various PIs have played key roles, including the construction of moduli stacks parametrizing p-adic representations of the Galois groups of p-adic local fields and of local models for these stacks, and recent extensions of the Taylor-Wiles patching method which relate it to the study of coherent sheaves on the local models, and to derived algebraic geometry. Some specific questions that the PIs will study are the problem of potentially crystalline lifts, the construction of a general p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and the possible local nature of the (a priori global) patching constuction.  More generally, the PIs intend to introduce algebro-geometric, categorical, and derived perspectives into the p-adic Langlands program, with the intention of gaining new insights into and making new progress on some of the key open problems in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To remain competitive, U.S. industries need to rapidly accelerate the use of intelligent robotics.  As a result, the nation needs to train highly skilled technicians who can program, use, maintain, and repair intelligent industrial robots. This collaborative project will address the nation?s shortfall of qualified technicians in intelligent industrial robotics.  It intends to do so by establishing a collaboration between academic institutions and major manufacturers in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama. Together these partners will define the necessary skillset for the next-generation industrial robotics technical workforce.  They will also develop a curriculum that will allow students to learn those skills. This project will result in one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.  This effort will thus support U.S. businesses and industries to rapidly and effectively incorporate next-generation robotics in their workplace.<br/><br/>The project has the following specific aims:  1) develop intelligent robotics curricular modules; 2) implement train-the-trainer workshops for educators; 3) identify skill sets needed for handling the next-generation robotics; 4) develop a knowledge base of next-generation robotics for secondary and post-secondary educators; and 5) increase public awareness of next-generation robotics.  By using a collaboration among four academic institutions in the eastern and central regions of Tennessee and Alabama, and involving major manufacturers in the region, the project expects to deliver outcomes that will be sustainable and can be replicated or adapted at other institutions.  This project intends to develop one of the first programs in the nation for workforce training at community and technical colleges in intelligent robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.

Mathematically this object is a constant mean curvature surface. It is closely related to the solution of the Plateau problem, which requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given shape in space. This problem is a classical question in the Calculus of Variations. The area is an energy functional, and the expectation is that minimizing it will lead to a stable configuration. In this project the PI addresses questions concerning the minimization of certain energy functionals that take into account noise and small random fluctuations of the phenomena being modeled. The expectation is that this theory will be better suited to reflect actual minimization questions arising in nature. A fundamental feature of the area functional is that it is invariant under rotations of space (if that space is homogeneous). The PI will address geometric and analytic questions in inhomogeneous and crystal-like spaces providing a model that reflects nature more accurately. This project will contribute to US workforce development through training and mentoring of graduate students and post-docs.<br/> <br/>One of the PI?s goals is to show that ?almost minimizers?, which are minimizers to noisy variational problems inherit some of the properties of minimizers of the same functional without noise.

The bacteria may manipulate their insect hosts? reproduction in ways that improves the health or number of female hosts carrying the bacterium. Relevant to this study, these bacterial ?symbionts? can sabotage host sperm such that fertilized eggs laid by females without the bacterium die early in life (?cytoplasmic incompatibility,? or ?CI?). Currently, two common, unrelated bacteria are known to cause CI in insects: Wolbachia, and Cardinium hertigii, the focus of this study. The main goal of this project is to discover the molecular mechanism by which Cardinium causes CI in insects. The benefits of this work are at least two-fold. Bacteria such as Cardinium target animal cell division, a fundamental process that can be understood better when examining how Cardinium interferes with it. Secondly, CI-causing bacteria may be used for pest or vector management. The CI agent Wolbachia reduces the susceptibility to viruses of insects that carry it, and is currently being introduced around the world to mosquito populations, with major implications for reduction of vector-borne disease and the global bioeconomy. The project will also provide engaging science education targeted for under-represented groups through outreach programs for elementary school (U Arizona Insect Discovery and Insect Festival), high school (production of a book ?Animal Manipulating Parasites at NC State, and Iowa State George Washington Carver Internship program) and undergraduate students (via research opportunities at all three institutions). <br/><br/>For Cardinium strains that infect Encarsia spp., parasitic wasps of whiteflies, genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes that are likely to be important in CI and/or symbiosis. The central hypotheses are that (1) Cardinium effector proteins involved in modifying host DNA during spermatogenesis are associated with the testes, and other Cardinium effectors involved with rescue of modified sperm are present in the ovaries of infected wasps, (2) the role of these proteins can be inferred by identifying the host proteins they interact with and (3) that the B vitamin biotin has a critical role in CI and/or the symbiosis. The project presents a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses with a diverse array of approaches, in four objectives: (1) Compare Cardinium localization and CI candidate gene expression in male pupal Encarsia, the ?modification? stage, with patterns observed in adults.(2) Identify Cardinium and Encarsia proteins involved in CI with differential proteomics. (3) Use heterologous expression to identify interacting host proteins of CI candidate proteins. (4) Investigate the role of Cardinium synthesized biotin in modification of host proteins. This project will shed light on the sophisticated CI reproductive manipulation by Cardinium. Cardinium has received comparatively little attention, but produces a virtually identical CI phenotype to Wolbachia with what appears to be completely independent eukaryote-interacting genes, a plasmid and not a phage, and an unusual type 6 secretion system. What is learned about Cardinium candidate gene function, expression and host targets will illuminate CI and symbiosis in both systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some hosts combat such parasitism by actively defending their nests from adult parasites. Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) produce unique ""seet"" calls to warn about the presence of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). In response to seet calls, female warblers return to sit tightly on the nest to prevent cowbird parasitism. This means that, much like words in human languages, seet calls symbolize cowbird parasitism for the warblers. The project?s aim is to understand how hosts perceive and process the acoustic and functional meaning of these symbolic signals by studying the behavioral responses (in the field) and neurophysiological patterns (using fMRI) of warblers to the cowbird?s own calls, seet calls, and other sounds typical of the warbler?s habitat. The grant will train a postdoctoral fellow, three PhD students, one Master's student, and at least eight undergraduate researchers, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will write and share case studies based on their research as open online educational resources for undergraduate courses in organismal biology. Additional broader impacts will include bird banding workshops for the general public, especially during the vibrant migratory seasons in central Illinois and Michigan. Finally, a short 3D virtual reality film-feature will be produced entitled ""A Day in the Life of the Cowbird"", featuring characteristic daily activities of parasitic birds and their interactions with hosts, as seen from the parasite's own eyes' perspective.<br/><br/>Current and past research on alarm calling in animals has often focused on the detailed discovery and characterization of the meaning of referential communication signals. However, the sensory-perceptual abilities of animals to recognize referential calls and the potentially high-level neural processing that ultimately leads to a specific behavioral response have not yet been fully explored. Through integrating field and laboratory experiments and levels of analyses, this research aims to test the overarching hypothesis that referential signaling requires high-level cognitive abilities. Using Yellow Warblers? anti-brood parasitic alarm calls to Brown-headed Cowbirds as a study system, four specific predictions will be assessed regarding that referential calling (i) involves perceptual equivalency of alarm calls and their referents, (ii) is socially acquired but may be modified by personal experience with cowbirds, (iii) involves mental imagery, episodic-like memory, and mental time travel, modifying future behavior so as to decrease risks to fitness, and (iv) is a functionally specific response to obligate brood parasitism. The project couples behavioral and population-level predictions of Yellow Warblers' responses to seet calls with probing of developmental trajectories and neural substrates of referential communication in wild birds via in vivo imaging (fMRI) to repeatedly collect data across development. This integrative research will provide new perspectives on the cognitive ecology and mechanisms of referential communication, including potentially transformative understanding of the neural substrates underlying the perception of symbolic calls, the existence of mental time travel in novel contexts, and the functional substrates of referential signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising approach is to embed, within the tissue, microscopic sensors that can be stretched, compressed and deformed by cell-generated forces. By recording these sensor shape changes with microscopy, the cell-generated forces can be measured over time.  One barrier to developing this technology is the lack of robust, non-toxic, polymeric materials for use as sensors.

In this work, the PIs will test two novel approaches for genetically modifying parasitic wasps. One method relies on exposing wasps to genetically-modified hosts, and the other relies on injecting adult female wasps with constructs that will specifically be taken up by their ovaries and embryos. Success of either of these methods would revolutionize our ability to interrogate gene function in in parasitic wasps. This information would be helpful for the bioeconomy because it would provide the means to manipulate parasitic wasps to the benefit of controlling pest insects.  This award also funds training of a graduate student. Thus, this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science in an area relevant to the bioeconomy. The PIs will broadly publicize and disseminate their research to academia and biotech companies via conference symposiums, lab workshops, and video protocols. <br/><br/>Host-parasite interactions, like predator-prey interactions, are some of the most important ecological interactions in nature, and parasitic wasps and their arthropod hosts are one of the most ubiquitous examples of this type of relationship. Parasitic wasps are diverse, they infect most insect species, and they are one of the most common biocontrol agents used against agricultural pests. Unfortunately, standard functional genomics methods like RNAi and CRISPR are inadequate in parasitic wasps, given that they obligately complete their juvenile development inside their hosts and are thus recalcitrant to standard injection procedures. To fully harness the potential of parasitic wasps as a model system, the PIs will develop novel applications of RNAi and CRISPR to maximize the efficiency of dsRNA and Cas9-gRNA delivery into wasps. In Objective 1, the PIs will test whether ubiquitous expression of wasp-targeted dsRNAs in transgenic host flies will cause systemic RNAi knockdown in wasp parasites. This new method would take advantage of the facts that hymenopterans can be fed dsRNAs to induce RNAi, and that endoparasitoids obtain a majority of their nutrients by consuming host tissues. In Objective 2, the PIs will test whether use of a wasp-specific glycolipoprotein leader sequence will cause CRISPR components (Cas9/gRNA) to be trafficked into the developing embryos of wasp ovaries to cause gene knockouts.

A surface of a fixed topological shape can have many different geometries. For example, a two-dimensional shape with no holes is a topological sphere, which could be a round sphere (like the surface of a planet), a polyhedron (a crystal like-shape with facets), or an ellipsoid (an egg-type shape). A shape with one hole (a torus) could look like an inner tube, a tire, or a hula hoop. The collection of all possible geometries is known as a moduli space, and these spaces occur over and over again in fundamental physical questions. This NSF award provides funding for a project to study questions of what typical, or random, surfaces look like, from the point of view of understanding families of curves on these surfaces. The research and outreach activities are mutually reinforcing; the project highlights bridges between different areas of mathematics, and deep connections between research, mentoring, and public engagement programs in mathematics. In addition the project provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>Starting with simple to state problems about counting special trajectories on surfaces whose geometry comes from Euclidean polygons and polyhedra, and motivated by theoretical physics (Newtonian mechanics, electron transport, and supersymmetric quantum field theory), this project connects to fundamental questions in many different areas of mathematics, including Teichmuller and homogeneous dynamics; Diophantine approximation and the geometry of numbers; probabilistic models and limit theorems; and the geometry of moduli spaces of meromorphic differentials on surfaces. Building on his prior collaborative work, the PI plans to explore questions on the counting and distributions of curves in varying geometries on higher-genus surfaces and higher-dimensional tori.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A classification of these spaces will rest on a mathematical understanding of the possible shapes they can take and the rigidity and flexibility properties they can have. These properties are known as invariants and they come from algebraic, analytic, and geometric considerations, often with crucial input from physics. The proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture established that three-dimensional spaces, called manifolds, decompose into pieces that admit explicit geometries. In the last few decades, ideas from quantum physics have led mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of subtle invariants and structures of three-manifolds and the knotted curves contained in them. There are several open conjectures, both in physics and in mathematics, that predict deep relations between quantum structures and geometries of three-manifolds. This project will investigate the relations of these quantum invariants to the geometric structures arising from Thurston's picture and explore the ramifications and applications of these connections to mathematics and physics. The project also provides topics for graduate student research.<br/><br/>The project will combine geometric and quantum topology techniques to study the interplay of geometry, topological quantum field theories (TQFT), and combinatorial structures of three-manifolds, with an eye towards developing tools to tackle open conjectures in quantum topology. One part of the project will continue work around the Turaev-Viro invariants volume conjecture, and on the geometry of quantum representations of surface mapping class groups. The goal is to understand the extent to which asymptotic features of TQFT detect or determine the existence of hyperbolic pieces in the geometric decomposition of 3-manifolds. A second part of the project will study relations between the colored Jones knot polynomials, the topology of incompressible surfaces in link complements, and hyperbolic geometry. A third part will develop methods for recognizing geometric structures on three-manifolds from purely combinatorial input and derive estimates on geometric quantities from topological data. This includes the study of low-genus incompressible surfaces in certain link complements and the understanding of how knot diagrammatic properties and constraints affect the geometric structure of link complements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By utilizing remote cameras, biologists and ecologists can monitor and manage wildlife in order to prevent the transmission of zoonotic disease from animals and the invasion of wildlife on crops and livestock. However, current cyberinfrastructure (CI) in wildlife monitoring is limited to normal angle videos with a limited field of view and has caused missing the recording of important events that occurred outside of the direction being filmed. Moreover, existing remote cameras only allow the recording of short videos for a few minutes and thus cannot document many hours of wildlife activity in the monitoring zone. This project proposes methods for panoramic video monitoring that capture 360 degree uninterrupted videos to document complete wildlife activities. The project will allow wildlife scientists to access high fidelity monitoring data in both the spatial and temporal domains. Panoramic videos will not only capture comprehensive details on and near the monitoring site, but also depict the monitoring context of the data collection. The abundant research data and metadata embedded in panoramic videos will enhance the productivity of biologists and ecologists. If successful, the proposed wildlife monitoring CI will accelerate the adoption of panoramic data collection in other field research such as agriculture and archeology. The research outcomes, including the datasets generated and the software developed, will provide an interdisciplinary opportunity for undergraduate research, course curriculum development, and high school outreach activities, especially for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project investigates a video collection cyberinfrastructure to enable panoramic wildlife monitoring. The design objective is to archive days to weeks of high resolution video data for long lived monitoring under the limited storage and energy constraints of remote cameras. To this end, this project proposes a framework for collaborative local and networked storage. First, we propose camera computing strategies to understand the scientific value of monitoring content and maximally compress the video with negligible overhead. This would mitigate the overall need for storage. Second, we propose a networked storage scheme to address the intermittent nature of the network in the wild, where only partial video is transported while the remaining video is generated in the receiver. We then schedule compressed video tiles for local storage or networked storage by orchestrating the storage, network and battery resources. Finally, we will develop and deploy the panoramic video monitoring in real wildlife research. We will validate the CI on the Savannah River site and assist wildlife scientists to study the impacts of animal interaction on disease transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some hosts combat such parasitism by actively defending their nests from adult parasites. Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) produce unique ""seet"" calls to warn about the presence of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). In response to seet calls, female warblers return to sit tightly on the nest to prevent cowbird parasitism. This means that, much like words in human languages, seet calls symbolize cowbird parasitism for the warblers. The project?s aim is to understand how hosts perceive and process the acoustic and functional meaning of these symbolic signals by studying the behavioral responses (in the field) and neurophysiological patterns (using fMRI) of warblers to the cowbird?s own calls, seet calls, and other sounds typical of the warbler?s habitat. The grant will train a postdoctoral fellow, three PhD students, one Master's student, and at least eight undergraduate researchers, including students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The researchers will write and share case studies based on their research as open online educational resources for undergraduate courses in organismal biology. Additional broader impacts will include bird banding workshops for the general public, especially during the vibrant migratory seasons in central Illinois and Michigan. Finally, a short 3D virtual reality film-feature will be produced entitled ""A Day in the Life of the Cowbird"", featuring characteristic daily activities of parasitic birds and their interactions with hosts, as seen from the parasite's own eyes' perspective.<br/><br/>Current and past research on alarm calling in animals has often focused on the detailed discovery and characterization of the meaning of referential communication signals. However, the sensory-perceptual abilities of animals to recognize referential calls and the potentially high-level neural processing that ultimately leads to a specific behavioral response have not yet been fully explored. Through integrating field and laboratory experiments and levels of analyses, this research aims to test the overarching hypothesis that referential signaling requires high-level cognitive abilities. Using Yellow Warblers? anti-brood parasitic alarm calls to Brown-headed Cowbirds as a study system, four specific predictions will be assessed regarding that referential calling (i) involves perceptual equivalency of alarm calls and their referents, (ii) is socially acquired but may be modified by personal experience with cowbirds, (iii) involves mental imagery, episodic-like memory, and mental time travel, modifying future behavior so as to decrease risks to fitness, and (iv) is a functionally specific response to obligate brood parasitism. The project couples behavioral and population-level predictions of Yellow Warblers' responses to seet calls with probing of developmental trajectories and neural substrates of referential communication in wild birds via in vivo imaging (fMRI) to repeatedly collect data across development. This integrative research will provide new perspectives on the cognitive ecology and mechanisms of referential communication, including potentially transformative understanding of the neural substrates underlying the perception of symbolic calls, the existence of mental time travel in novel contexts, and the functional substrates of referential signaling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many forests, however, historical information is limited and it is difficult to assess the impact of loss of species on forest ecosystem structure and function. Historical landscape paintings may be a valuable source of information about the past, as they present color images that pre-date photography. These pictures may offer a way to explore past changes in forest structure that relate to current patterns in forest productivity and ecosystem function. However, the use of these images in historical ecology has been hampered by questions of image validity: How truly accurate are the images portrayed in these paintings? How much of an image is an artist?s manipulation of a scene to best illustrate a message, allegory, or romanticized view of nature? The proposed interdisciplinary project uses tools and knowledge from humanities and ecological sciences to address these concerns. The main objective is to assess how to mine forest paintings by nineteenth-century American artists as a potential data set for historical ecology. This project also represents a rare deep integration of approaches from science and humanities and has the potential to serve as a model for how crossing of disciplinary boundaries may have high value to society.<br/><br/>This project joins the expertise of art scholars (who understand how and why nineteenth-century landscape images were created) with the expertise of scientists (who understand the structure and function of forest ecosystems). Research will focus on images and forests in the northeastern US from the nineteenth century. This was an era in which the forest landscape was rapidly transforming, and during which the popularity of landscape painting ? particularly as practiced by the so-called Hudson River School ? was simultaneously exploding.  With historic and ongoing land use changes coupled with historic (and ongoing) species losses, northeastern forest landscapes are an ideal place to explore forest change over the past two centuries.  Most historic records for this region, while extensive in some regards, generally tell us little about forest structural dynamics, stand regeneration dynamics, or community composition and natural disturbance rates.  An interdisciplinary research approach exploring forest ecology and art history in tandem can help us understand historic ecosystems and how the representation of forested landscapes affects modern concepts of wilderness and nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In summer/fall 2019, 90% of the scallops in eastern Long Island died, and this coincided with the emergence of an undescribed parasite that disrupts the kidney of infected animals. Genetic analysis showed that the parasite belongs to the Coccidia subclass of parasites, and this pathogen is now designated bay scallop Coccidia or BSC. This project will identify how BSC infects and kills scallops, and why some scallops are resistant to infection or death. Results from this study  promotes the progress of science because research will identify mechanisms that regulate host-parasite interactions in scallops, and may help us understand how other Coccidia cause disease in economically important systems. It advances the national prosperity and the bioeconomy because results help scallop farmers and ecologists prevent or minimize death of this economically-important crop. This research will also provide tools to enable a broad research community working on apicomplexan parasites of invertebrates. This proposal also uses funding to train a post-doc, and graduate and undergraduate students to train the next generation of scientists. Results expected from this work will facilitate the recovery of bay scallops in New York waters, and will serve as a reference if BSC spreads to other coastal regions in the USA.<br/><br/>Despite the common nature of Coccidia infection in invertebrates, very little is known about the biology of these microorganisms and the factors that regulate infection success. This RAPID will use an ongoing epizootic to generate information needed to characterize an ecologically- and economically-important member of the Coccidia that infects bay scallop (BSC). The study will use a combination of high-throughput sequencing techniques (genome and RNA sequencing), traditional cellular techniques (parasite purification, primary cell culture), and molecular biology methods to characterize BSC and probe the relationship between parasite life stages and scallop health; to evaluate how the disease will develop with the onset of summer conditions, conditions thought to be stressful to bay scallops; and to determine what genetic and environmental factors differentiate resistant scallops from susceptible ones. The new data are expected to solve an information gap that has been hampering the understanding of the mechanisms of survival and disease of BSCs in marine invertebrates. Moreover, the genetic information obtained from this work can be the basis for developing diagnostic tools to identify BSC infections and outbreaks in the future, which helps the bioecomony. This research will identify mechanisms that regulate host-parasite interactions in scallops, and may help us understand how other Coccidia cause disease in economically important systems.

Examples of research that uses the Neotoma resource include understanding the causes and consequences of past extinction, assessing the sensitivity of species to large environmental changes that accompanied past ice ages, and measuring how quickly species adapt to past rapid environmental changes. Neotoma?s open data access will also facilitate new forms of education and outreach, by giving students and teachers direct access to research-quality data and empowering them to run their own analyses of past climate and biodiversity dynamics. This will help train the next generation of the scientific workforce, with crossover skills in both geological and data sciences.<br/><br/>Neotoma has become a research resource in paleoecology, paleoclimatology, macroecology, biogeography, and environmental archaeology, with rapid growth in data volume, kinds of data supported, and active third-party and externally-supported research projects. Gathering thousands of site-level records into high-quality, global-scale, data networks requires substantial effort. Datasets must be carefully checked, taxon names harmonized, age-depth models updated, and uncertainties quantified. Neotoma will continue to address these challenges through a model of centralized infrastructure and distributed data governance. Priorities for this project are: 1) establishing international coverage for data types and research communities that now have critical masses of trained data stewards and data volumes in North America (pollen, diatoms, ostracods, testate amoebae, vertebrates), and 2) establishing critical masses of data and data stewards for recently added data types (specimen-level stable isotopes, organic biomarkers). Cyberinfrastructure improvements will include: 1) a web-based interface for bulk-uploading metadata and data from many sites, 2) better support for specimen-level isotopic measurements, 3) better visualization and analytical support for micropaleontological species-environment calibration datasets, and 4) a rebuild of Neotoma?s home webpage. Sustainability priorities include: 1) support for the recently launched non-profit EarthLife Consortium Foundation, and 2) a workshop in which leaders from Neotoma and other community data resources will receive training in building strategic sustainability plans, learn tools to manage finances and plan for the future, develop strategies to diversify their funding base, and enhance communication skills. These updates and improvements to Neotoma will enhance the existing data resource for current users, and will help early-career researchers, for whom data availability and data-science training can open new career pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical part aims to advance our understanding of the shapes that surfaces present when they are most efficiently navigating their environment. Of course, the notion of efficient depends on the context, so the project considers a number of settings, expecting to find both differences and similarities in the optimal shapes as the criteria for ""best shape"" are changed.  In terms of education, the setting is that nation will need about a million more engineers in the coming decade than we expect the pipeline, as it is currently configured, to produce. At the same time, students from less well-resourced high schools, even if smart and hard-working and interested in a career in science, technology, engineering or mathematics, leave those STEM fields at an alarming rate, as they have trouble transitioning from high school to college. A program led by the PI has achieved notable success in cutting the attrition from STEM students of high potential but less-than-optimal preparation: the grant will help grow, sustain, develop and disseminate information about this comprehensive holistic approach to retention of students in STEM. <br/> <br/>The project will investigate, via harmonic maps, the asymptotic holonomy of surface group representations in the Hitchin component of several low rank Lie groups. The equivariant harmonic maps from surfaces to the associated symmetric spaces have holomorphic invariants, the geometric topology of which can predict the holonomy of the representation, up to a decaying error.  At the same time, the error estimates are strong enough to suggest a unity of approaches: a rescaling of the range and the maps produces a harmonic map to a building, while an apparently different building may be constructed algebraically via an associated real closed field and a valuation. Other projects include finding a new basic minimal surface in three-space through moduli space techniques, a new type of uniformized metric through geometric analytic techniques, and a refinement of a classical circle-packing result on surfaces.

The discovery and design of such alloys demand a detailed knowledge of the thermodynamic factors governing stability in a very high dimensional composition space with potentially many competing crystal structures. This complexity tests the limits of current thermodynamic modeling capabilities due to the sheer number of input data needed and of parameters entering the model. The project addresses this by combining (i) large-scale meta-databases of experimentally-derived thermodynamic models with (ii) thermodynamic data from high-throughput quantum-mechanical calculations, using formal statistical and active machine learning techniques. The end product of this effort is an openly distributed large-scale encompassing thermodynamic model that can be queried in a high-dimensional compositional space and that returns structural stability information as interactive tridimensional cross-sections, or as composition- and temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties. As this space of possible alloys is so vast compared to the number of known high-entropy alloys, the potential for discoveries of novel alloys through this tool is significant and this could broadly impact numerous engineering applications where capabilities are limited by materials properties.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/><br/>The project leverages and integrates two recent developments from the PI's group: (i) a search engine (the Thermodynamic DataBase DataBase or TDBDB), that indexes all available experimentally-derived thermodynamic data electronically available in standardized format in the scientific literature; (ii) a suite of software tools (the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit or ATAT) that streamlines the generation of thermodynamic databases from ab initio data. This hybrid approach aims to combine the distinct advantage of state-of-the-art experimental and computational methods, namely, the higher accuracy of the former and the high-throughput nature of the latter.<br/><br/>Active machine learning and statistical techniques are used to (i) target the exploration of promising composition regions likely to form solid solutions with simple crystal structures and (ii) develop efficient statistical mechanics models of non-stoichiometric solids that require few ab initio inputs, thus enabling ""high-throughput"" operation. Whereas existing computational high-throughput efforts primarily focus on the properties of defect-free stoichiometric compounds at absolute zero, this project targets, at all temperatures, the broader range of materials including disordered alloys with possible short-range order and ordered alloys with possible point defects. This demands efficient statistical mechanical models of (i) short-range order, (ii) strongly anharmonic phases and (iii) magnetic ordering, each of which requiring fewer ab initio input than existing brute force methods, by exploiting both known and data-mined trends.<br/><br/>The data and tools devised during this project are expected to have broader impacts: virtually all engineering materials are nonstoichiometric alloys whose properties are tuned by controlled additions of numerous components (with high entropy alloys only representing an extreme example). Hence, this resource could greatly facilitate materials discovery and optimization by augmenting existing computational high-throughput efforts that currently only target ordered compounds at absolute zero. The broad compositional gamut covered also enables applications that could range from identifying glass-forming metallic alloys to determining possible exoplanet core compositions and structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike clinicians providing ongoing care in hospital wards, emergency care providers engage in complex tasks that are unpredictable, time-critical, and cognitively consuming. More importantly, most of these tasks require their eyes and hands on the patient, rather than on a medical record. Emergency care work is inherently important to society as it involves life-threatening injuries and situations that affect people from all backgrounds. Improving the work efficiency of emergency care will lead to decreased medical errors and better patient outcomes. To this end, this research will develop novel tools and interaction techniques for real-time and hands-free data capture in fast-paced medical work. This project uses Emergency Medical Services (EMS) as an example domain to derive design requirements by determining how context-specific information should be captured and integrated in real time, to support the work of emergency medical teams while also accounting for their limited capacity to interact with handheld computing devices. The specific research contributions of this project will include: 1) a conceptual and empirical understanding of the information behaviors and temporal rhythms of emergency care providers collecting data during fast-paced medical work; 2) approaches for supporting real-time data capture and integration; 3) novel interaction techniques to reduce the physical and cognitive demands of using data capture tools; and 4) recommendations based on the development and evaluation of hands-free data capture prototypes in both simulated and real-world settings.<br/><br/>This research has two main aims. The first aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the work practices, issues, and the technological needs around real-time data capture during fast-paced medical events. Understanding what, when, and how contextual information is currently being documented will inform the design of innovative approaches toward seamless and unobtrusive data capture. The researchers will pursue this objective by conducting fieldwork and video analyses. Building upon the findings, the second aim focuses on iteratively designing technological solutions to support rapid, hands-free data capture. The researchers will take a multi-phased, user-centered approach involving participatory design, rapid prototyping, and formative evaluation methods. Findings and design recommendations will be generalizable to multiple domains including information behaviors in time-critical work, human-computer interaction in environments where direct interaction with devices is limited, and designing for wearable technologies to support rapid data capture and integration from multiple sources. The conceptual insights and design recommendations derived through this project can potentially be applied in other settings facing similar challenges with real-time data capture and integration such as disaster response.

A fundamental feature of quantum mechanics is that if you perform a measurement on a physical system, it has the effect of permanently altering the state of the system.  This means that the order in which one performs measurements on certain physical systems matters.  In this context, we say that measurement is ""non-commutative"".  The inherent non-commutativity of quantum mechanics is described by the theory of operator algebras, which is the branch of mathematics that investigates how to efficiently manipulate and encode arbitrarily large matrices of numerical data.  Today,  operator algebras and quantum theory are both well-established and independent branches of the mathematical sciences. However, in recent years, with the advent of quantum computation and quantum information science, there has been a resurgence of fruitful interactions between the more mathematical theory of operator algebras and the more physical theory of quantum mechanics.  The primary goal of this project is to explore and deepen the emerging connections between operator algebra theory and quantum information theory (QIT).  The central objects of study in this project are quantized symmetries in operator algebras and QIT.  Understanding the symmetries of systems has long been a powerful tool in mathematical and physical problems, and the highly non-commutative nature of both operator algebras and QIT naturally leads to the discovery of more flexible notions of symmetries, called quantum symmetries.  In this project, we will use various mathematical incarnations of quantum symmetries to provide a link between operator algebra theory and QIT, and we will use this link to provide new insights into both of these important fields. This project will contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research project breaks up into two main directions. The first direction concerns the structural theory of some new and interesting classes of operator algebras arising from quantum isomorphism spaces.  Quantum isomorphism spaces appear naturally in the study of quantum teleportation and super-dense coding schemes in QIT, and also in the representation theory of quantum permutation groups.  The study of these algebras leads us to propose a quantum analogue of Lueck?s determinant conjecture from geometric group theory and investigate its potential applications to constructing new examples of strongly 1-bounded and strongly solid von Neumann algebras. The second direction of this project relates to the Principal Investigator's pioneering work on the interactions between quantum symmetries and QIT. Here, geometric and representation-theoretic tools will be used to find applications of non-local games arising in QIT to the construction of new examples of hyperlinear discrete quantum groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Edge computing environments pose new challenges, as devices are heterogeneous, widely distributed geographically, and physically closer to end users, such as mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. This project develops EdgeVPN, a software element that addresses a fundamental challenge of networking for edge computing applications: establishing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to logically interconnect edge devices, while preserving privacy and integrity of data as it flows through Internet links. More specifically, the EdgeVPN software developed in this project addresses technical challenges in creating virtual networks that self-organize into scalable, resilient systems that can significantly lower the barrier to entry to deploying a private communication fabric in support of existing and future edge applications. There are a wide range of applications that are poised to benefit from EdgeVPN; in particular, this project is motivated by use cases in ecological monitoring and forecasting for freshwater lakes and reservoirs, situational awareness and command-and-control in defense applications, and smart and connected cities. Because EdgeVPN is open-source and freely available to the public, the software will promote progress of science and benefit society at large by contributing to the set of tools available to researchers, developers and practitioners to catalyze innovation and future applications in edge computing.<br/><br/>Edge computing applications need to be deployed across multiple network providers, and harness low-latency, high-throughput processing of streams of data from large numbers of distributed IoT devices. Achieving this goal will demand not only advances in the underlying physical network, but also require a trustworthy communication fabric that is easy to use, and operates atop the existing Internet without requiring changes to the infrastructure. The EdgeVPN open-source software developed in this project is an  overlay virtual network that allows seamless private networking among groups of edge computing resources, as well as cloud resources. EdgeVPN is novel in how it integrates: 1) a flexible group management and messaging service to create and manage peer-to-peer VPN tunnels grouping devices distributed across the Internet, 2) a scalable structured overlay network topology supporting primitives for unicast, multicast and broadcast, 3) software-defined networking (SDN) as the control plane to support message routing through the peer-to-peer data path, and 4) network virtualization and integration with virtualized compute/storage endpoints with Docker containers to allow existing Internet applications to work unmodified. EdgeVPN self-organizes an overlay topology of tunnels that enables encrypted, authenticated communication among edge devices connected across disparate providers in the Internet, possibly subject to mobility and constraints imposed by firewalls and Network Address Translation, NATs. It builds upon standard SDN interfaces to implement packet manipulation primitives for virtualization supporting the ubiquitous Ethernet and IP-layer protocols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particulate matter in the open ocean consists primarily of organic material from plankton and other biological detritus, which can readily aggregate to form large flocs. A combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes transforms these flocs as they settle, redistributing material throughout the water column and potentially sequestering elements such as carbon in the deep ocean. The impact of these transformations is affected by the sinking speed of these flocs, with larger and denser particles settling faster than smaller, less-dense ones. One of the key questions facing oceanographers today is what controls particle settling speed (for example, particle size, shape, and density). There is considerable evidence that particles readily break apart as they settle, decreasing their average size and settling speed, but it is not yet understood what conditions cause these disaggregation events. This work will measure the breakup characteristics of organic settling particles both in the laboratory and at sea to quantify the importance of these breakup processes relative to particle transport. The work will be done at the Pennsylvania State University in collaboration with the University of Georgia to target the development of future marine particle disaggregation models for use by the oceanographic community.<br/><br/>This research will play an important role in determining the importance of disaggregation on the vertical transport of particulate matter in the ocean. The project will quantify the breakup of organic marine aggregates due to fluid forces caused by turbulence or swimming organisms. Phytoplankton will be cultured and formed into aggregates in the lab prior to disaggregation using calibrated turbulence. The size, shape, and structure of these aggregates before and after breakup will be quantified using high-speed visualization and holographic imaging. In addition to the laboratory measurements, a deployable instrument that can disrupt particles in-situ and measure their size and shape will be built and deployed in the North Atlantic during the spring bloom of phytoplankton. Detailed measurements of particle concentrations, breakup characteristics, organic content, and ambient turbulence as a function of depth in the water column will be collected. This work will represent the first study of marine aggregate breakup in-situ. Specifically, the project will clarify: (1) under what conditions disaggregation is important, (2) how strong different types of natural marine aggregates are and how their strength varies with size, composition, and morphology, and (3) how aggregate size, composition, and structure influences the distribution of its breakup mass.

The development of high performance, low cost and environmentally friendly solar cells is therefore critical for our energy security. One of the most promising new class of materials for solar energy is metal halide perovskites.  The power conversion efficiency of solar cells made from such perovskites has witnessed an unprecedented rate of increase. Despite their outstanding performance, perovskites have poor stability and are prone to photo-decomposition due to ion migration. There are also serious issues with their environmental compatibility as the highest performing perovskite solar cells contain lead, a highly poisonous metal. Furthermore, lead iodide, a common decomposition product of these materials, is carcinogenic. In the face of these challenges, it is necessary to identify and develop high performing and lead free perovskites that are intrinsically stable under light irradiation and when exposed to the environment. This project will investigate solar cells based on chalcogenide perovskites?an alternative to metal halide perovskites typically used in solar cells. These materials are free of lead and use a chalcogen such as sulfur, which could result in superior stability. This project could lead to a new class of high performance and environmentally stable solar cells and photodetectors with transformative impacts.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>A number of fundamental science and device engineering issues will be addressed in this project in order to enable the successful deployment of chalcogenide perovskite based materials in high performing optoelectronic devices such as photo-detectors and solar cells. These include: (1) understanding the nature of defects in these materials, and how they affect the dark current, band structure, mid gap states, and carrier lifetimes. The chalcogenide perovskite material growth conditions will be carefully controlled, to minimize such defects; (2) Alloying strategies to optimize the band gap of chalcogenide perovskite based materials will be theoretically predicted using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Such alloying will also be experimentally realized to demonstrate chalcogenide perovskite materials with optimized bandgaps; (3) State of the art machine learning tools (guided by ab initio calculations and experiments) will be used to systematically screen the entire family of chalcogenide perovskite materials in order to find the optimal material and alloying combination; (4) Photo-detector and solar cell devices constructed using the optimized chalcogenide perovskite material will be developed and systematically characterized to demonstrate the proof of concept. The above tasks will together provide the fundamental knowledge that is needed to demonstrate high performing, environmentally stable and lead free optoelectronic devices using the family of chalcogenide perovskite materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key unanswered question is how Antarctic life will respond. If warmer waters contribute to fish disease susceptibility, then iconic Antarctic predators they support, including penguins, seals, and killer whales, will suffer. A recent scientific cruise on the Antarctic peninsula encountered a population of crowned notothen fish that were plagued by pink, wart-like tumors that covered 10% to 30% of the body surface on about a third of the animals. Similar tumors had not previously been reported, suggesting that this might be a new disease that threatens Antarctic fish. The goal of proposed work is to identify the biological origins of the tumor and how it affects cell function and organismal physiology. The work is potentially transformative because it studies what might be a harbinger of Antarctic fish responses to global climate change. The project has several Broader Impacts. First, it will publicize the tumors. Because Antarctic researchers have never reported a tumor epidemic, the community must become aware of the outbreak and the tumor?s distinct diagnostic features. Second, dissemination of project results will stir further research to determine if this is an isolated event or is becoming a general phenomenon, and thus a broad concern for Antarctic ecosystems. Third, assays the project develops to detect the disease will enhance research infrastructure. Finally, work will broaden the nation?s scientific workforce by providing authentic research experiences for high school students and undergraduates from groups underrepresented in scientific research. <br/><br/>The overall goal of proposed work is to identify the biological origins of the neoplasia and how it affects cell function and physiology. Aim 1 is to identify the pathogenic agent. Aim 1a is to test the hypothesis that a virus causes the neoplasia by isolating and sequencing viral nucleic acids from neoplasias and from animals that are not visibly affected. Aim 1b is to test neoplasias for bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or invertebrate parasites not present in healthy skin. Aim 2 is to learn how the disease alters the biology of affected cells. Aim 2a is to examine histological sections of affected and control tissues to see if the neoplasias are similar to previously reported skin diseases in temperate water fishes. Aim 2b is to examine the function of neoplastic cells by RNA-seq transcriptomics to identify genes that are differentially expressed in neoplasias and normal skin. Achieving these Aims will advance knowledge by identifying the causes and consequences of an outbreak of neoplasias in Antarctic fish. Proposed work is significant because it is the first to investigate a neoplasia cluster in Antarctic fish.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will devise new mathematical tools and methods to systematically describe CPHS and optimize their operation. The application focus is on wireless body area networks, a natural CPHS representative with humans in the loop, heavily resource-constrained operation, and heterogeneous components that are intertwined with and altered by human behavior. The end will result will help understand important factors related to the operation of CPHS and how to optimize their operation. It will advance stochastic modeling, estimation and control theories to collectively address the challenges associated with this problem. It will also expose underrepresented K-12 students in Albany city to STEM fields from the lens of CPHS through project-based school visits and hands-on workshops on simple sensor systems, and prepare UAlbany students to become CPHS innovators by introducing CPHS concepts and activities in existing courses. Women and underrepresented groups will be encouraged to participate in this project by leveraging existing minority and underrepresented groups programs at the University at Albany.<br/><br/>CPHS have the potential to adaptively optimize their operation towards continuous real-time monitoring of an individual's state, environment and related behaviors, while providing real-time recommendations. To unleash the potential of CPHS, unique challenges related to sensing, communication, computation and control need to be jointly addressed in the presence of heterogeneous data, resource constraints and humans-in-the-loop. This fundamental research will advance cyber-physical systems science by devising new mathematical tools and methods, and a theoretical framework that can be used as a building block for various CPHS applications. Specifically, the project will (i) devise a new theoretical stochastic model to describe key CPHS variables and their interactions, (ii) design novel accurate and scalable estimators for CPHS and derive relevant theoretical performance bounds to quantify the fundamental limits of the estimation process in this context, and (iii) devise new controlled sensing, commmunication, and recommendations strategies to optimize the operation of systems with complex dynamics and heterogeneous capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Landslides occur globally, can cause tsunamis, and pose threats to people and infrastructure, especially near coasts. To reduce this impact on people and infrastructure, it is critical to advance our understanding of slope stability in ocean sediments. This project focuses on continental margins where earthquakes typically do not occur, and as such, do not act as triggers for landslides. In these sites, it remains unclear how the skeletal remains of microorganisms that live in the ocean and end up in ocean sediments could potentially weaken and precondition those sediments for failure and underwater landslides. The goal of the education activities is to provide high impact learning experiences and research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. This project is geared towards students from underrepresented groups in a STEM field, namely geosciences, in Texas, which lacks Earth science curriculum requirements. This will be achieved through an annually recurring education program with the local Bryan High School consisting of classroom visits, a one-day workshop, and two-week summer research activity. An undergraduate and graduate student course will be developed, which includes a domestic field trip to West Texas and New Mexico to study submarine slope channels and landslide deposits. Through all components, this project will foster next-generation researchers who can facilitate interdisciplinary science and broad collaboration to advance knowledge and mitigate natural hazards.<br/><br/>This research project integrates experimental and numerical efforts and aims to characterize the role of microfossils in generating weak layers, which could become large-scale glide planes for submarine landslides. In this project, marine sediments will be systematically mixed with diatomite in varying concentrations and under repeatable conditions. The research goals are to determine key microfossil concentrations with threshold behavior, exact location within the sediment package, and burial conditions under which overpressure may be induced and wide-spread failure initiated within or above a microfossil-rich weak layer. Therefore, this proposed research will not only provide insights into slope failure mechanisms for microfossil-rich sediments but will also help in identifying potential future glide planes from cores and/or logging data from submarine and lacustrine settings where landslides may occur without external triggers like earthquakes. To document mechanical, hydraulic, and shear properties of microfossil-rich marine sediments, uniaxial resedimentation and constant rate of strain consolidation, as well as direct shear and triaxial shear experiments will be conducted at effective stresses corresponding to common landslide initiation depths. Microstructural changes, microfossil deformation, and development of shear failure planes will be qualitatively and quantitatively characterized by integrating analysis of hydromechanical data from deformation experiments with microscale imaging observations. Numerical slope stability models will provide insights into upscaling measured properties and introducing heterogeneous layered systems that analyze the interaction between microfossil-rich weak layers with over-and underlying non-biogenic sediments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These occur in numerous systems that cut across multiple NSF programs involving soft matter, an umbrella term for readily deformable materials, and includes soft robots, plastics, complex fluids, textiles, particulate media, glasses and biological materials as well as other applications in mathematics and computer science involving computational geometry. Shape change is an important feature of these systems, or a goal of the envisioned applications, but predicting their behavior is very challenging. There is presently a lack of appropriate simulation tools readily available to practitioners working in these domains inhibiting quantitative, mechanistic understanding of their behavior and optimization for applications. With Morpho, domain scientists gain a powerful new simulation tool that enables them to tackle larger and more complex shape evolution problems than presently possible. The project also creates a user community by providing extensive training opportunities including an immersive annual workshop, high quality documentation and a virtual community.<br/><br/>Shape optimization and evolution problems are numerically extremely challenging because the final shape is not known ahead of time: The numerical representation must be continuously monitored to ensure the solution obtained is correct and of high quality. The central innovation of Morpho is to regularize ill-posed shape problems by introducing auxiliary functionals that capture some notion of mesh quality. The aim of this work is to extend the range and complexity of problems Morpho can solve in two ways. The first is to allow the user to incorporate arbitrary types of manifolds, field quantities defined on the manifolds, discretizations, functionals and constraints pertinent to their problem. The second is to leverage multilevel algorithms and GPU computing to accelerate the simulations and enable the software to predict the dynamical response of the system given an initial configuration. The project also engages domain scientists in creating and using Morpho through a user-centered development process and a community driven science and education program, incorporating documentation, a repository of example code and tutorials, a virtual community and an annual training workshop. The resulting software and educational materials enable other researchers to simulate shape evolution in several emerging fields involving soft matter and other areas including active materials, soft robots, programmable materials and extreme mechanics. <br/><br/>This award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research within the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The magnetism is the result of an interaction of light with gold metal. Although gold metal has no magnetic behavior in the dark, and light does not usually generate stable magnetic fields, two features of this system enable light-induced magnetism. First, the gold is prepared in the form of very small particles, called nanoparticles, that are much smaller than the wavelength of light. Because of their small size, gold nanoparticles have a unique ability to greatly concentrate and enhance the absorption of light. Second, the light is circularly polarized, meaning that the beam of light also causes rotational motion of electrons in the metal nanoparticles. These combined effects produce large circulating electric currents in the nanoparticles that, in turn, give rise to magnetic fields. Each nanoparticle behaves like a small, very strong magnet. The magnetic field is only present when the light is shining, so the magnetism can be switched on and off as quickly as the light can be turned on and off. With better understanding, this behavior can allow for even smaller and faster magnetic switching than current computer memory systems that store information in switchable magnets. This work also supports student training in scientific communication to non-technical audiences.<br/><br/>This research analyzes the optical, magnetic, and thermal behavior that results from resonant enhancement of coherent, rotating charge displacement in plasmonic metal nanostructures during excitation with circularly polarized light. The generation of magnetic fields in matter due to the direct transfer of angular momentum from circularly polarized optical fields is termed the inverse Faraday effect, and is the central focus of study in these experiments. The inverse Faraday effect is analyzed using both time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy and continuous wave spectroscopy on colloidal suspensions of gold nanoparticles that are designed to provide plasmonic enhancement of the incident optical field. Experiments are focused on distinguishing optically-induced magnetism from other non-linear optical phenomena, such as the optical Kerr effect, or non-coherent thermalization processes. The experiments also quantify the magnitude, frequency dependence, time response, and microscopic mechanism of the optically-induced magnetism, in order to elucidate new avenues of optoelectronic and opto-magnetic functionality in nanostructures enabled by ultrafast, optically modulated magnetic field generation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These materials are composites with hard-magnetic particles embedded in soft matrices. The actuation is achieved through transferring the magnetic micro-torques in the magnetic particles to the soft matrix.

The development of high performance, low cost and environmentally friendly solar cells is therefore critical for our energy security. One of the most promising new class of materials for solar energy is metal halide perovskites.  The power conversion efficiency of solar cells made from such perovskites has witnessed an unprecedented rate of increase. Despite their outstanding performance, perovskites have poor stability and are prone to photo-decomposition due to ion migration. There are also serious issues with their environmental compatibility as the highest performing perovskite solar cells contain lead, a highly poisonous metal. Furthermore, lead iodide, a common decomposition product of these materials, is carcinogenic. In the face of these challenges, it is necessary to identify and develop high performing and lead free perovskites that are intrinsically stable under light irradiation and when exposed to the environment. This project will investigate solar cells based on chalcogenide perovskites?an alternative to metal halide perovskites typically used in solar cells. These materials are free of lead and use a chalcogen such as sulfur, which could result in superior stability. This project could lead to a new class of high performance and environmentally stable solar cells and photodetectors with transformative impacts.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>A number of fundamental science and device engineering issues will be addressed in this project in order to enable the successful deployment of chalcogenide perovskite based materials in high performing optoelectronic devices such as photo-detectors and solar cells.

This water movement?or transpiration?is also linked to a tree?s ability to store carbon via photosynthesis. However, it is not well understood how different tree species respond to urban heat with respect to maintenance of transpiration at high temperatures or shifts in the dates of leaf development and leaf fall. Thus, cities do not have adequate information to choose the species that are best equipped to thrive under stressful conditions and bolster climate resilience under warming. This project uses drone and satellite imagery analysis to observe these responses in a manner only previously possible under laboratory conditions. This project will increase our understanding of how trees in an urban environment can help to mitigate the warming of cities though the cooling impact of trees.<br/><br/>Information on how species and planting site (e.g., downtown street tree, suburban park tree) influence urban forest transpiration is lacking, in part because it is difficult to account for a city?s high degree of land cover heterogeneity at fine spatial scale.

Drone measurements of leaf temperature and chemistry will be acquired multiple times per day to examine the extent to which photosynthesis and transpiration track one another or diverge. Weekly satellite imagery capable of measuring leaf abundance at the individual tree scale across a large city will be used to assess changes in urban forest start and end of season, a fundamental control on seasonal transpiration. These analyses are among the first to provide observational evidence of how urban tree function may be altered by increased heat at daily and seasonal increments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Operator theory began with the study of matrices (arrays of numbers), and by the early twentieth century, had given much of the mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. Since then, operator-theoretic techniques have had several applications, especially in constructing and studying a variety of useful functions, i.e., rules that encode specific types of information. For example, in control engineering, setups such as autopilot systems that accept inputs, receive feedback, and release outputs can be modeled with general matrices (or operators), while a system?s key information is often encoded in its transfer function. Recently, operator theory techniques have also been used to decompose signals into simple pieces, via something called a wavelet construction. In this project, the principal investigator will use operators to study problems related to a specific class of functions, called rational functions, which appear in such applications. Many of these problems have parts that are amenable to undergraduate research, and much of the research in this project will be explored alongside diverse groups of undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>More precisely, this project concerns rational functions in one and more variables that are bounded on certain domains. Such rational functions include finite Blaschke products (FBPs), which have played significant roles in factorization, interpolation, and approximation problems in complex analysis. Recently, FBPs have arisen in the context of a famous open problem in operator theory called Crouzeix?s conjecture, which basically says that the numerical range of a bounded operator on a Hilbert space is a 2-spectral set for that operator. The first goals of this project are to use FBPs to investigate and solve various cases of Crouzeix?s conjecture, use Crouzeix?s conjecture to ask and answer new questions about FBPs, and to explore related questions about spectral sets, compressed shifts, and truncated Toeplitz operators. The second topic of this project concerns multivariate (rational and non-rational) functions on the bidisk and polydisk. Specifically, the second main goal is to use model/realization theory to systematically characterize the structure and fine boundary regularity of bounded analytic functions on the bidisk and polydisk. This goal is motivated by recent work on both the structure of rational inner functions near boundary singularities and new canonical realization formulas for general bounded analytic functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zircon is common in crustal rocks and is the most frequently used mineral to infer ages and crystallization temperatures attained by rocks. Despite the extensive use of zircon for time and temperature determinations, there are no methods for determining the depth of zircon crystallization. The objective of this project is to develop a method to determine depth of zircon formation by investigating quartz crystals trapped as inclusions at various stages of growth in >4 Ga old Hadean zircon. Dr. Gonzalez will achieve these goals by modeling the elastic interactions between quartz inclusions and their zircon host and integrating model results with existing zircon geochronologic and thermometric determinations. The quartz-in-zircon elastic model applied to Hadean zircons from the Jack Hills province of Australia will give insights into the timing and evolution of the onset of Earth?s plate tectonics. During his tenure as an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, Dr. Gonzalez will organize and participate in educational events hosted by the University of Pavia to explain ongoing research to the general public and prospective students. Furthermore, he will co-mentor undergraduate and graduate students and organize a dedicated website about the project, where plain language descriptions of ongoing results will be accessible to anyone interested.<br/><br/>Elastic models of host-inclusion mineral pairs have become frequently used tools for investigating the thermobarometric conditions of inclusion entrapment during host mineral growth. However, elastic models have only been developed for elastically anisotropic inclusions (e.g. quartz) contained in elastically isotropic host minerals (e.g. garnet). In order to understand the elastic interactions between elastically anisotropic host and inclusion minerals (e.g. quartz inclusions in zircon), the reciprocal crystallographic orientation (CORs) between the host and inclusion must be incorporated. At the University of Pavia, a series of finite element models will be completed to quantify the effect of crystallographic orientation on the strain and stress between the zircon host and quartz inclusion minerals. Once the effect of orientation is known, model results can be applied to quartz inclusions contained within Jack Hills zircons to infer the crystallization depth. Single crystal X-ray diffraction will be used to obtain the crystallographic orientation and unit cell parameters of the zircon host and quartz inclusion, permitting calculation of the remnant pressure within the inclusion. Remnant pressures and crystallographic orientations can be used in finite element models and applied to 3-D X-ray tomographic models of targeted inclusions to determine the possible entrapment conditions of the quartz inclusion within the zircon host. Quartz-in-zircon results from Jack Hills zircons will be used to evaluate hypotheses that modern style plate subduction processes began under relatively cool thermal regimes in the Hadean Eon. More broadly, the quartz-in-zircon elastic model will be widely applicable to crustal rocks and can be combined with other petrologic methods to increase understanding of Earth processes.

Results of this research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 or COVID). This project will produce an understanding of why some coronavirus strains that normally infect specific animals (such as birds and bats) sometimes also infect humans, whereas other strains do not. This knowledge is critical for understanding how viruses break species barriers to colonize new hosts and precipitate widespread infections, as experienced during the ongoing COVID pandemic. Coronaviruses infect cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and passing through organelles known as endosomes and lysosomes to access the cell interior. This project will investigate how the environment within these cellular structures regulates the intensity of viral infection. Through the use of comparative biology across different vertebrate species, the goal will be to identify conditions in endosomes and lysosomes that facilitate infection in particular organisms. This research may be the basis for identifying biomarkers of severity of disease or COVID spread. This research will also provide tools to enable a broad research community working on COVID and other viruses. This proposal also uses funding to train graduate and undergraduate students. As such this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science. Results expected from this work will facilitate identification and control of COVID spread in humans and other animals. <br/><br/>The coronoaviridae (CoVs) are a family of single-stranded RNA viruses that infect three vertebrate groups: mammals, birds and fish. Understanding the molecular determinants underpinning this tropism, namely why CoVs naturally and efficiently infect these species, and target specific tissues within these animals, is a fundamental biological concept. Definition of the mechanisms restricting CoV tropism is therefore critical for our understanding of how CoVs break species barriers and colonize new hosts. In this RAPID proposal, the role of the luminal microenvironment of the endolysosomal system in determining the efficiency of CoV infection will be studied for different CoVs in different vertebrate species. The central hypothesis is that the cellular proteins called ion channels resident in endosomes and lysosomes are differentially present in lower mammals and humans. Furthermore, these ion channels uniquely create environments within endosomes and lysosomes in lower mammals that are critical for supporting coronaviral infection  and the differential expression of endolysosomal ion channels between tissues and species regulates the effectiveness of CoV infection. This hypothesis will be tested using a variety of cell models, imaging approaches and infection assays.

Such times include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 21 thousand years ago (a colder time with lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) and the Pliocene Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (a warmer time with higher carbon dioxide). These periods can be used to estimate the sensitivity of climate to changes in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Those sensitivity estimates help predict the amount of global warming we should expect to see in response to future greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent work has shown that the climate?s sensitivity to greenhouse gases depends not only on the average surface temperature change but also on the geographic pattern of that change. Thus, use of geological paleoclimate records to estimate future warming must account for how the spatial pattern of temperature changes in the past differs from that expected in the future. This project will combine information from paleoclimate data and climate models to evaluate the spatial pattern of surface temperature changes during the LGM and Pliocene. It will then develop methods to account for temperature pattern differences when using data from these past periods to help estimate future global warming.<br/><br/>Earth?s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the change in average surface temperature associated with a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) relative to the pre-industrial atmosphere. The ECS is set by the radiative feedbacks that link surface warming to changes in the amount of radiation leaving Earth?s atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that global radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial pattern of sea-surface temperature (SST). Estimates of ECS based on the proxy record of past climate changes ? such as those during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pliocene ?  have traditionally been based on global mean energy budget constraints and thus do not account for how SST patterns in those states may be different from those in the future. This research will use recently developed data assimilation techniques, combining information from climate models and proxies, to reconstruct gridded SST fields for the LGM and Pliocene that are dynamically consistent with available proxy data. These SST fields will then be compared against those projected by global climate models under CO2 forcing. The sensitivity of radiative feedbacks to differences between LGM / Pliocene and CO2-forced SST patterns will then be quantified using a suite of atmospheric general circulation models and Green?s functions that link warming patterns to radiative feedbacks. By producing estimates of LGM and Pliocene surface temperature patterns and quantifying the impact of temperature pattern differences on radiative feedbacks, this research will improve our understanding of ECS derived from those past climate states. This work will further facilitate researchers? participation in activities aimed at introducing high school students to climate science, through Current Climate Science workshops for high school teachers facilitated by the University of Washington?s Program on Climate Change and through George Mason University?s Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Non-Technical Summary  <br/><br/>One of the major limitations in the discovery and design of new materials is the capability of predicting which compounds can potentially be synthesized.  The underlying fundamental principles are not well understood and have historically required extensive trial and error.  This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, investigates and pushes the boundaries of synthesizability of crystalline solids, enabling the development of new strategies for preparing future technological materials.  Discoveries stemming from the research efforts can provide new methods to prepare, for example, less toxic or more energy-efficient compounds that are critically important to the nation?s semiconductor and electronic ceramics industries.  More generally, the advancement of strategies to synthesize materials over a wider attainable range of compositions and structures enables the rapid acceleration of their technological development.  An in-depth characterization of the local and long-range structural features is aimed at understanding the impacts on the local structure and/or disorder of materials that occur at the edges of synthesizability.  The inspiration and training of the next generation of scientists is facilitated within these technologically relevant basic research activities, including professional experiences at national laboratories and the development of research experiences for high school and community college teachers.  The educational activities also emphasize the recruitment and participation of research students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.  <br/><br/><br/>Part 2. Technical Summary<br/><br/>Metastable crystalline solids are ubiquitous and can be commonly found as a result of either synthetic or naturally occurring processes, such as in the formation of crystalline diamond or in the synthesis of austenite stainless steel.  The synthesis of metastable solids with technologically relevant properties, but that are extremely difficult or impossible to prepare, is a growing limitation in many research fields.  The central objective of the research project is to elucidate and exploit the underlying factors that can govern the kinetic stabilization of metastable phases.  Research thrusts specifically focus on metastable Sn(II)-containing perovskites that have potential applications as new lead-free ferroelectrics and as small bandgap semiconductors.  The synthetic component is directed toward the discovery of new pathways to increase the range of synthesizability that can be experimentally achieved with the use of reaction conditions that can, for example, drive product formation while controlling ion diffusion and phase segregation in order to inhibit decomposition.  Structural characterization by X-ray and neutron scattering techniques is aimed at answering key questions regarding the formation and decomposition pathways of these compounds.  The extent and distribution of local and long-range structural disorder is probed at the precipices of energetically downhill decomposition pathways and the resulting new insights can help to push the limits of kinetic stabilization.  Experimental efforts are complemented with quantification of thermodynamic relationships using open materials databases and density functional theory.  Educational initiatives within this project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, include research training of undergraduate and graduate students, involvement of high school and community college teachers in research, and offering of an annual workshop on Rietveld methods for learners at a range of stages in their education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When metal ions move though water, they push past the water molecules as they go. It is already known that hydrogen ions migrate in a completely different manner and faster. The researchers study in detail how this process works and what makes it many times faster than the diffusion of metal ions, for example what makes it faster than that of lithium ions in batteries. Several factors can enable very fast, hydrogen-ion batteries that have the potential to be charged and discharged for millions of cycles, and so present a remarkable opportunity to realize the Holy Grail of electrochemical energy storage: to achieve simultaneously the energy densities of batteries and the power and cycle life of capacitors. The abundance of hydrogen also makes hydrogen-ion batteries a promising candidate for the grid-level storage batteries that are needed to provide a continuous and dependable electricity supply from intermittent power sources such as wind and solar energy. Advancing knowledge and the associated technology in these areas aids the United States to remain economically competitive. Additionally, the project produces educational videos targeted to students and the broader public that present concepts in energy storage and its role in society. Training of graduate and undergraduate students with the skills needed to enter the workforce in the energy technology sector and additional outreach activities take place at both institutions.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The existing knowledge of battery chemistry is built upon the understanding that the kinetics are dictated by desolvation and vehicular diffusion of the working ion. The research in this collaborative project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, explores a new paradigm of battery chemistry where by using protons as the working ions with an aqueous electrolyte, charge conduction does not rely on the long-range physical migration of ions through the host electrode but instead obtains long-range movement of charge via the Grotthuss mechanism of proton displacement along the crystal water network in an electrode. Transport of protons via the Grotthuss mechanism involves the movement of a quasiparticle defect in the bonding topology of water. It is fundamentally different from the vehicular transport of metal cations and could give rise to ultra-fast insertion kinetics and the ability to provide batteries that deliver high power at ultra-low temperatures. The project focuses on mechanisms of proton transport and storage in Turnbull blue and its family of analog compounds. These systems have an open and defected crystal structure that hosts an internal network of crystal water. The crystal water network provides pathways for Grotthuss diffusion, making the kinetics of proton transport and storage exceedingly fast, even at temperatures well below the freezing temperature of water. This project tests the central hypothesis that the transport performance of protons in this system depends on the topology imposed on the H-bonding network of crystal water by the surrounding host framework. To test this, the researchers a. determine the topological characteristics of the water network in Prussian blue analogs, from the atomic to the mesoscopic scale, and the role they play in Grotthuss topochemistry; b. elucidate the mechanisms of proton insertion, storage, and transport in the water network within Prussian blue analogs at all states of charge; and c. formulate testable design principles that can guide the development of new reticular materials for proton transport and storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How RNAs function in gene expression is dependent on their specific and complex three-dimensional shapes or structures and on their ability to undergo precisely timed and executed structural changes (their dynamic rearrangements). With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Ruben Gonzalez and Dr. Colin Nuckolls from Columbia University to study how RNAs fold and/or undergo structural rearrangements and how the dynamics of a particular RNA structural ?switch? controls the expression of a human gene. Drs. Gonzalez?s and Nuckolls? research team uses carbon nanotube-based field-effect transistors (smFETs) to follow the detailed dynamics of individual RNA molecules in three-dimensional space and across time. Notably, the smFET method allows the study of RNA dynamics without the need to chemically modify the RNA or apply invasive external forces. A deeper understanding of how RNA-based structural switches function to control gene expression impacts the discovery and development of therapeutics that act on important biomolecular targets and/or functions. In addition, the project increases participation by women and underrepresented minorities in STEM by leveraging existing outreach programs in New York City. Kits are developed to demonstrate nucleic acid structures and single-molecule biophysics in K-12 community outreach, while education modules are developed to teach integrated concepts of chemistry, biology, and computer science at local high schools. <br/><br/>Using smFETs, Drs. Gonzalez?s and Nuckolls? research team investigate the kinetic mechanisms with which RNA stem-loops, a fundamental class of RNA structures, fold and undergo functionally important, dynamic structural rearrangements at unparalleled molecular, spatial, and temporal resolutions. The resulting model is used to determine the mechanism through which the naturally occurring, post-transcriptional methylation of the N6 position of an adenosine in the stem of a RNA stem-loop found within a human precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) regulates the dynamics of this RNA stem-loop as a means for controlling the splicing of the pre-mRNA. Specifically, the proposed studies characterize the folding and dynamics of this stem-loop and tests the hypothesis that the post-transcriptional, N6 methylation of the adenosine alters the dynamics of the stem-loop (i.e., throws the ?switch? on) so as to unmask the binding site of an RNA-binding protein that directs the differential splicing of the pre-mRNA. The results of these studies provide a general model for the function of RNA stem-loop based conformational switches and a detailed understanding of the mechanism through which a post-transcriptional modification of a stem-loop controls the alternative splicing of a pre-mRNA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has long been known that Earth?s ice sheets expand when atmospheric CO2 is low and melt as CO2 rises, but the underlying climate mechanisms remain unclear.  Expanded sea ice coverage in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica may have limited the release of carbon from the deep ocean during natural cold periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~20,000 years ago).  Greater sea ice extent and northward movement of oceanic fronts may have also led to carbon storage in the deep ocean.  Reliable paleoclimate records from the Southern Ocean are thus essential to understanding the controls on atmospheric CO2 over long timescales. The proposed study will develop new methods to produce such records, using chemical analyses of microscopic fossils from marine sediment cores. The educational impact of the proposed work includes support for a graduate student and an undergraduate at the University of Connecticut.  <br/><br/>The proposed work will focus on developing a new proxy for sea ice extent based on the oxygen isotope ratios (d18O) of benthic and planktonic foraminifera. Sea ice formation in the Southern Ocean is characterized by near-freezing surface conditions and negative buoyancy forcing, which creates a unique vertical profile in d18O.  Preliminary data from the published literature shows that the d18O difference between recent planktonic and benthic foraminifera yields an estimate of sea ice extent consistent with modern observations.  We also plan to develop a novel proxy for subtropical front position based on foraminiferal magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) and d18O analyses. Contemporary measurements of sea-surface temperature and the d18O of seawater capture the position of the subtropical front, implying that reconstructions based on Mg/Ca and d18O can be used to track frontal position in the geologic past.   Motivated by these initial results, we propose to use a transect of cores from ~55ºS to 35ºS in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean to: 1) estimate sea ice extent and surface buoyancy forcing during the LGM, and 2) reconstruct the position of the subtropical front during the LGM to constrain inter-basin exchange between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The proposed work could transform our understanding of the Southern Ocean by adding two new methods to the paleoclimate toolkit.  The d18O sea ice proxy will complement existing diatom-based methods and it can be used in regions where diatoms are sparse.  Similarly, development of the subtropical front technique will lay the groundwork for studies of the deglaciation when changes in frontal position have been invoked to explain rising atmospheric CO2.  Given the relevance of the techniques to research questions across a range of timescales, we anticipate our results will be of broad interest to the paleoclimate community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An ionic material is a salt.  Professor Lavallo is developing novel ionic materials where both the negatively charged part (anion) and the positively charged (cationic) portion form new materials that may have applications in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to catalysis to environmental waste remediation. This group has a long history of mentoring high school students from underrepresented groups and will continue and expand these outreach activities.  In addition, undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be directly involved in the project and provided with training to prepare them for entry into the workforce in high technology areas.<br/><br/>Weakly coordinating anions generally function as spectators with little or no function in chemical reactions.  In this project, the implementation of super bulky phosphines and N-Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHC), containing two covalently bound polyhalogenated closo-carborane anions, will be explored as weakly coordinating anions that are also capable of controlled reactivity.  The spectator carboranes that flank the phosphine and NHC lone pairs of electrons provide kinetic protection at these reactive sites, enabling the formation of complex ion pairs that contain both a reactive cation and anion. These systems are akin to traditional frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP), except that these species are electrostatically tethered. Such species could achieve more challenging bond activations/group transfers for C-F bond activations, exemplified by the CF bond scission of CF4, a potent greenhouse gas. Additionally, these systems will provide a unique opportunity to isolate the so-called elusive encounter complex in FLP chemistry.  These systems will be formed via the solid state hydrogenation of crystalline ion pairs and studied via subsequent analysis via cryo micro electron diffraction. A second embodiment of this project is the exploration of ligand effects on anionic Au(I) hydroamination catalysts, supported by the dianionic phosphines and NHCs. These transition metal anions will be paired with trityl and silylium ions to form reagents capable of generating highly reactive carbocations in the coordination sphere of the metal.  Such reactions may lead to a heterolytic oxidative addition and unprecedented low-coordinate alkyl/aryl Au(III) compounds. The targeted Au(III) compounds will have two cis accessible coordination sites and thus may be capable of classical d8 transition metal catalysis. The ability of these species to mediate migratory insertion, carbonylations, as well as other reactions mediated by other low-coordinate D8 metals will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dimensions are special from an anthropic perspective, since they model our everyday perception of the physical world, and from a mathematical perspective, since the phenomena they exhibit and the collection of techniques used to study them are rather different from those in higher dimensions.  Combinatorics refers to the study of discrete structures, such as networks and flows, and it is influential in the development of codes and algorithms.  Combinatorial methods have long influenced topology.  Amongst the various techniques that come to bear on low-dimensional topology are graphs of surface intersections; lattice-theoretic methods; and extremal combinatorics. Each technique has led to sensational progress on the main problems in low-dimensional topology, and they lend very different perspectives on the subject.   The unifying goal of this research project is to advance combinatorial methods towards problems in low-dimensional topology. Alongside the research component, the PI will conduct activities that integrate his research interests with education and training initiatives that reach audiences from the high school level to postdoctoral researchers. For instance, the PI is actively involved with mathematics enrichment at the high school level through the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics and Mathematical Staircase, Inc. In the context of these programs and in other mentoring activities, he seeks to inspire the discovery process and aid in the exposition of beautiful mathematics. He ran a graduate summer school focused on a central theme in low-dimensional topology, Dehn surgery, and is in the process of editing a book based on it.  He has also written a survey article on Heegaard Floer homology for the Notices of the AMS, the most widely-read general interest periodical targeted at professional mathematicians, and he is committed to more expository work aimed at a wide mathematical audience. The award provides funds for supporting graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will develop combinatorial methods in low-dimensional topology, in continuation of an established program. The main projects focus on studying graphs of surface intersections in application to exceptional Dehn surgery and embeddings of surfaces in the four-sphere; lattice embeddings and their refinements in application to the study of rational homology balls, slice links, and surface isotopy; and extremal combinatorics in application to properties of curves on surfaces. The surface intersection techniques are more direct and rely on the development of graph theoretic tools in order to draw topological conclusions.  Floer homology methods are less direct but apply heavy machinery to a vast collection of problems.  This project will more closely bind combinatorics and low-dimensional topology. The PI currently advises three PhD students and has just graduated one student.  The PI runs original graduate courses on various themes, including advanced combinatorics and the knot complement problem, and will continue to do so.  This award will support graduate students during summer months and assist them with travel funds. At the postdoctoral level, the PI mentors and collaborates with post-doctoral fellows.  This award will support them with travel funds. At the scholarly outreach level, the PI intends to undertake more expository projects with the aim of reaching and educating a wide audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several factors threaten the freshwater resources of the RMI. These include high rates of local sea-level rise, year-to-year sea-level extremes, flooding during storms, and droughts.  In addition, the seasonal northward shift of the tropical rain belt is critical for renewing the RMI water supply each year.  Planning for the future in this and other low-lying island nations in the Pacific requires an improved understanding of the response of the tropical Pacific to climate change. Those responses include changes in temperatures, winds, precipitation, and sea level.  The research goal of this study is to use climate data from corals, sediments, and models to document the response of the tropical Pacific to past natural climate change.  The integrated education and research aspects of this CAREER program will build on existing partnerships with the Biosphere 2 (B2), Tucson Unified School District (TUSD), and the Marshall Islands Marine Resource Authority (MIMRA). This study will improve our understanding of the risks of drought and salt-water flooding in the Marshall Islands, train the next generation of scientists, and inspire solutions for an improved future.<br/><br/>	This CAREER program will expand the network of high-resolution records to the northwest equatorial Pacific Ocean, developing the first coral paleoclimate reconstructions from the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). These coral records, which provide a monthly history of temperature, salinity, and wind conditions, are particularly critical in this data-poor region. Further, RMI sits on the axis of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and at the northern limit of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), providing a critical end member for assessing their climate impact. Finally, westerly wind events are common in this region and drive severe coastal flooding, making these sites promising candidates for the application of a novel wind proxy to improve our understanding of trade-wind variability and inundation risk.  This CAREER program will utilize new and existing cores from living and fossil coral boulders to develop the first coral-based reconstructions of ITCZ variability (Objective 1), last-millennium hydroclimate (Objective 2) and inundation risk (Objective 3) in the RMI, and assess Pacific hydroclimate dynamics over the last millennium (Objective 4). These results will therefore improve our understanding of tropical Pacific hydroclimate and water resources (e.g., drought and inundation risk) under natural and anthropogenic climate changes.  This integrated science and education program will also provide unique research and educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students in both the USA and RMI. Through progressive and cooperative solution-oriented learning activities, this program will bring together Arizona and Marshallese communities to develop and evaluate new K-12 educational modules, train a diverse group of next generation marine scientists, and share powerful Marshallese stories to promote urgency for solutions.  These modules will create hands-on activities with 3D printed corals, and interactive virtual reality tours of reefs and coastal communities under a changing climate.  To maximize the impact of these educational activities, the resources and outcomes will be disseminated at professional development workshops for teachers in TUSD and RMI schools. The material will also be integrated into the B2 website and marine educational program (reaching over 100,000+ visitors and 10,000+ K-12 students each year) and posted on Carleton Cutting Edge website for educators nationwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coastlines, clouds, and leaves are examples of such objects that occur in nature. The famous coastline paradox states that since a coastline is so rough at so many different scales, it has no defined length. The PI plans to develop and study new methods to build such multiscale objects and to break them down into easily handled pieces. New ways to decompose objects often lead to great advances in mathematics, where simple problems can have complicated, multiscale solutions. The project?s three-prong approach includes studying ways to break down complex objects, build complex objects out of simple pieces, and to measure multiscale complexity. In addition to the research, the PI will train graduate students and postdocs in the techniques developed by this project through advising, seminars, minicourses, and reading groups and disseminate material on his webpage for public access.<br/><br/>The project aims to study problems in metric geometry, geometric measure theory, and harmonic analysis related to maps and surfaces with multiscale structure, that is, objects like Lipschitz and Holder maps or fractals, that are hard to approximate by affine maps or by planes. One focus is the study of geometric problems that have non-smooth solutions but no smooth solutions, such as the Nash Embedding Theorem. Solutions to these problems often use multiscale or self-similar structure to break rules that smooth maps have to satisfy, and one aim of this project is to understand when and why this phenomenon occurs. Another focus is quantitative and uniform rectifiability. Uniform rectifiability has been a powerful tool for studying singular integrals and geometric measure theory in Euclidean space. Recent work has made it possible to find sharp bounds on the quantitative rectifiability of surfaces in the Heisenberg group, and this project will explore the possibility of extending notions of uniform rectifiability to the Heisenberg group and using them to solve problems in the geometry of Euclidean space and the Heisenberg group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a project to both solve some long-tanding classical problems at the interface of Representation theory and Quantization and to uncover and study a new kind of ""double affine"" symmetry.

Such computer models could help predict cardiovascular disease by simulating spatial and temporal patterns of disease growth. To develop these models, we need a software infrastructure that integrates modeling techniques from multiple disciplines. This project will develop software for this purpose and will apply the software to the calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) problem, which is prevalent in aging adults. The project will also help to understand the interaction between the fundamental biological and mechanical processes involved in CAVD. The project leverages existing resources at Northern Arizona University to perform outreach activities targeting underrepresented minority students in the region. The outcome of this study will contribute to advancing the national health and improving our scientific understanding of the interaction between different processes in cardiovascular disease. <br/><br/>During the past two decades, significant advances have been made in the development of organ-scale patient-specific computational models of cardiovascular disease. These models often focus on a specific spatial and temporal scale and their goal is to quantify biomechanical biomarkers of cardiovascular disease growth. However, quantitative information about disease growth over long time scales is missing in these models. The goal of this project is to 1) Develop a software platform for multiscale two-way coupling between organ-scale biomechanics and cell-scale systems biology models. 2) Apply the computational framework to study the long-term spatial and temporal progression of CAVD. The organ-scale model will be based on continuum solid and fluid mechanics models, and the cell-scale model will be based on systems of differential equations. The developed software infrastructure could be applied to patient-specific data to model disease progression patterns. This will enable the development of transformative models that advance our knowledge of cardiovascular disease. The project will train highly interdisciplinary researchers at the interface of software development, biomechanics, and biology.

While the former three branches originate from quantum physics, the last one deals with applications of purely algebraic concepts to geometry. Representation theory concerns the study of symmetries of a vector space such as three-dimensional Euclidean space (more generally, an infinite dimensional space) with additional structures. These symmetries can be often thought of as algebraic structures such as groups, Lie algebras, or associative algebras. Two cases are of particular interest: (1) the case of sufficiently many pair-wise commuting symmetries, which is a primary subject of study in integrable systems, and (2) the case when the underlying vector spaces arise via generalized cohomology theories associated with geometric moduli spaces. This project aims at resolving several open questions pertaining to those cases through the study of shifted quantum groups; the first surprising connections of those novel algebras to Toda-like quantum (difference) integrable systems and quantized Coulomb branches were discovered in the recent work of the PI.<br/> <br/>The major theme of the proposed research is the study of shifted quantum affine algebras and the corresponding new structures on the quantized Coulomb branches. The project is broken down into five parts, as follows. The first part will investigate integral forms of shifted quantum affine algebras. One objective is to show that they map surjectively onto quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches and to describe explicitly the kernel of these maps using the shuffle approach. Another important structure to be constructed on such integral forms are coproduct homomorphisms: these will descend to the truncated counterparts, thus quantizing multiplications of the corresponding classical K-theoretic Coulomb branches. The second and the third parts of the project are aimed at the construction and study of monoidal categorification of the quantum cluster algebra structure on quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches via shifted quantum affine algebras, and a construction of new vertex operator algebras via shifted affine Yangians of gl(n). The fourth part deals with a novel approach to Lax matrices via antidominantly shifted quantum groups. This will bring new insights into now relatively old subject of the inverse scattering method. At the same time, it will also emphasize an overlooked importance of antidominant shifts, leading to a new study of Bethe subalgebras of the quantized Coulomb branches. This work will also provide a systematic construction of Baxter Q-operators, implying functional and TQ-relations for them. The fifth part of the project aims to obtain Kazhdan-Lusztig type character formulas for finite-dimensional representations of DeConcini-Kac truncated shifted quantum affine algebras at roots of unity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A good number of the issues the PI plans to address are a natural continuation of problems he has explored recently that keep progressing and diffusing through a wider mathematical community. The questions to be studied have a certain universality in the sense that the same paradigm reappears from geometry and analysis, to fluid dynamics and material sciences, to financial mathematics and, more recently, biology and stochastic geometry. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The first project concerns compressible flow (for instance, a gas) in porous media, in particular when the flow has a ""history"" that clogs with time the porous media (the Caputo diffusion model). Some important aspects of the Caputo diffusion model are being studied by the PI and an advanced graduate student, in particular when it occurs through two media with different porosity (transmission condition). Related mathematical phenomena concern the saline flow through semipermeable membranes (where the salt can flow only in one direction through the membrane). Another case where the flow is induced by global considerations concerns the quasi-geostrophic equation: this equation describes the evolution of the temperature on the surface of the ocean, and here temperature is influenced at a distance though the atmosphere. In collaboration with a graduate student the PI is working on the time evolution of this process in the land-sea interphase. Another interesting problem considered is concerned with ""overlapping"" interactions. An example is the structure of pricing for buying vs selling of goods. There is an area of ""values"" of the underlying good where the two prices diverge, and one where they come together. Mathematically, these are very interesting problems concerned with the stability of the configuration, in particular for the edge dividing one behavior from the other in a nonlinear way.

In addition the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will develop and extend invariants including abelian gauge theoretic models, cobordism invariants arising from the critical values of Morse like functions such as Daemi's Gamma invariant, equivariant extensions such as equivariant singular instanton knot homology, and new parameterized invariants that combine Konno adjunction-style complexes with homotopy invariants of families. It will also translate structures uncovered in some gauge theory packages to other packages, for example translating L-space notions from Heegaard Floer theory to analogues in the instanton case, or equivariant structures from the Seiberg-Witten Floer theory to the Heegaard Floer theory. Topological applications will include new insights into knot concordance, homology cobordism, diffeomorphism groups of 4-manifolds, and SU(2) representations of 3-manifold groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This electro-hydrodynamic phenomenon enables numerous engineering applications that range from water treatment and membrane-based separation processes, to energy storage and biomedical devices for drug delivery and diagnostics. Conventional models for electrokinetic flows do not properly account for nanoscale physical or chemical heterogeneities found on the surface of typical engineering materials or on advanced nanostructured materials. This project aims to develop a better fundamental understanding of electrokinetic flows on nanostructured surfaces that are superhydrophilic (i.e., strongly water-attracting) or superhydrophobic (i.e., strongly water-repelling). The knowledge gained will help in the development of key technologies for sustainable production of drinking water, food, and energy, and the design of more effective nanofluidic devices for analytical chemistry and biomedicine. Two educational initiatives will be created with this project; the ?Fluid Dynamics Day at Stony Brook University? and ?The Nanoscale Simulation Online School?. Research and educational activities in this project will have strong focus on the professional development and participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM, which include undergraduate and graduate students from low-income households.<br/><br/>The objectives of this research will be pursued through three specific aims: (1) formulation of a compact hydrodynamic description valid for electrokinetic flows on superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces, which will be validated against experimental data and molecular dynamics simulations; (2) experimental characterization of electrokinetic flows on superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces, to determine steady-state electroosmotic and pressure-driven flow rates as a function of the nanostructure period and height for different pH and electrolyte concentration; and (3) fabrication of surface samples having well-controlled periods (30-130 nm) and heights (20-200 nm) to enable the planned experimental study. In addition, the ionic composition of the liquid-solid/vapor interfaces formed on the studied nanostructured surfaces will be probed by x-ray and IR spectroscopy to unambiguously establish the origin of the zeta potentials measured in the electrokinetic flow experiments.  The proposed work will provide answers to open questions such as the specific mechanisms for electroosmotic flow and zeta potential enhancement on different hydrophobic surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such times include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 21 thousand years ago (a colder time with lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) and the Pliocene Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (a warmer time with higher carbon dioxide). These periods can be used to estimate the sensitivity of climate to changes in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Those sensitivity estimates help predict the amount of global warming we should expect to see in response to future greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent work has shown that the climate?s sensitivity to greenhouse gases depends not only on the average surface temperature change but also on the geographic pattern of that change. Thus, use of geological paleoclimate records to estimate future warming must account for how the spatial pattern of temperature changes in the past differs from that expected in the future. This project will combine information from paleoclimate data and climate models to evaluate the spatial pattern of surface temperature changes during the LGM and Pliocene. It will then develop methods to account for temperature pattern differences when using data from these past periods to help estimate future global warming.<br/><br/>Earth?s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the change in average surface temperature associated with a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) relative to the pre-industrial atmosphere. The ECS is set by the radiative feedbacks that link surface warming to changes in the amount of radiation leaving Earth?s atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that global radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial pattern of sea-surface temperature (SST). Estimates of ECS based on the proxy record of past climate changes ? such as those during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pliocene ?  have traditionally been based on global mean energy budget constraints and thus do not account for how SST patterns in those states may be different from those in the future. This research will use recently developed data assimilation techniques, combining information from climate models and proxies, to reconstruct gridded SST fields for the LGM and Pliocene that are dynamically consistent with available proxy data. These SST fields will then be compared against those projected by global climate models under CO2 forcing. The sensitivity of radiative feedbacks to differences between LGM / Pliocene and CO2-forced SST patterns will then be quantified using a suite of atmospheric general circulation models and Green?s functions that link warming patterns to radiative feedbacks. By producing estimates of LGM and Pliocene surface temperature patterns and quantifying the impact of temperature pattern differences on radiative feedbacks, this research will improve our understanding of ECS derived from those past climate states. This work will further facilitate researchers? participation in activities aimed at introducing high school students to climate science, through Current Climate Science workshops for high school teachers facilitated by the University of Washington?s Program on Climate Change and through George Mason University?s Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They operate without monitoring, do not emit pollution, and can be made from earth-abundant and non-toxic materials. The use of solar energy is rapidly growing, but it still accounts for only a small fraction of electricity production. To increase their share of the energy market, the cost of making and operating solar cells must be decreased and their efficiency must increase. Carrier-selective passivating contacts hold the promise of doing just that. Such contacts increase cell efficiency by reducing electrical losses at the interface between the layer of a solar cell that absorbs light and the metal contacts that extract electrical current. This project will use a unique way to improve the fundamental understanding and control of loss mechanisms in solar cells with such contacts. Laser processing provides a way to electrically activate carrier-selective passivating contacts by selectively depositing laser energy into a selected layer with fine control at high speed. This process has the potential to increase the power conversion efficiency of solar cells while maintaining low temperature and high throughput, thereby decreasing the cost per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. The generated knowledge will improve various types of solar power generating as well as other electronic and photonic devices. The proposal brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team with expertise in solar cell fabrication, laser processing, and atomic-scale characterization. The PIs will engage in extensive outreach to local high schools, museums, and libraries. The economic impact will be amplified through work with solar cell manufacturing companies. This project will help society meet its future energy needs using fewer resources at a reduced cost while preventing pollution and climate change.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>This project encompasses carrier-selective passivating contact development, photovoltaic device fabrication, laser processing, and imaging at the atomic level using transmission electron microscopy. Carrier-selective passivating contacted (CSPC) devices are a promising next generation technology for photovoltaic devices because they eliminate the two primary loss mechanisms: the direct metal contact to silicon and dopant diffusion into the bulk. A fundamental understanding of the interface quality, dopant type, dopant activation (and potential diffusion), tunneling mechanism, and the effect of the passivation layer is still lacking. Through a combination of device modeling, fabrication and laser processing experiments, and transmission electron microscopy studies, the quantitative degree of CSPC band bending and band gaps; effect of thermal crystallization on optical absorption, implied open-circuit voltage and defect content; and independent control of dopant activation, crystallization, grain growth, and dopant diffusion will be investigated to provide the photovoltaic industry a better understanding of CSPC for is manufacturing adoption. The novelty of the aim of this study lies in the use of pulsed laser processing of CSPC to provide a non-contact way of annealing the device with surface heating only. This work will provide a fundamental understanding of the interface properties at the atomic and nanoscale level and relate these studies to the optical and electronic properties as well as to device performance of a full-area state-of-the-art CSPC device. This project will have a broad impact by training an interdisciplinary, interuniversity, and diverse team of graduate and undergraduate students across two universities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the reliability of self-driving cars is a crucial step to ensuring that the impending ubiquity of self-driving cars causes as few fatalities as possible. Components like actuators, sensors, and computational elements that make up such systems have inherent vulnerabilities to faults due to manufacturing defects, aging, cyberattacks, and environmental factors. Repair and replacement of such components may reduce the risk of fault occurrences, but may be infeasible in terms of cost, safety, and availability. Alternately, certain faults and their false positives may trigger unnecessary repair or cause unnecessary reactions by the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify faults in real time. This research will facilitate the development of in-the-field error mitigation techniques, resulting in more reliable autonomous cars. Furthermore, this research will support the technical development and engagement of an underrepresented cohort of graduate and undergraduate students at North Carolina A&T State University and North Carolina Central University through curriculum enhancements and participation in extracurricular activities such as the AutoDrive Challenge, a national self-driving car competition.<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide real-time diagnosis of transient, intermittent, and permanent faults that occur in a self-driving car. This analysis will substantially improve the performance and accuracy of fault classification/identification in complex systems. Multi-perspective error detection techniques, including discrete-event system analysis, data-driven analysis, and chip-level analysis, will be combined to diagnose faults in automotive systems. The discrete-event system analysis will detect and isolate a system's fault occurrences from external observation of general behaviors of the system and in the absence of full observation of occurred events. The data-driven analysis will use a novel fuzzy type-2 clustering-based method to detect whether a fault degraded performance. The chip-level analysis will detect when a computational component is malfunctioning based on equivalence checking of logic signals and state traces. The combination of these approaches will facilitate fault diagnosis of automotive systems in real-time and with greater accuracy and speed. The multi-perspective analysis will improve the understanding of how each perspective interacts with the other and has the potential to identify new fault types and patterns. The enhanced awareness created by integrating these three unique methods will facilitate automotive system fault diagnosis in real time with greater accuracy and speed than could be achieved by any of the methods individually.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research suggests that more expansive STEM learning opportunities are possible in school and out of school when youth have opportunities to develop and share their experience with others, both in and beyond the classroom. Mentoring is a widely accepted strategy for supporting youth learning and identity development across a variety of sectors including education and workforce development. There is broad concern, however, that more empirical research needs to be done, especially related to middle school and high school youth in STEM. Young people can be effective leaders in both formal and informal learning contexts and such mentorship and pedagogy can lead to STEM learning and positive identity development with implications for broadening participation. In formal and informal contexts, having youth act in facilitator roles holds promise for identification with engaging in STEM content and practices. As such, this project investigates the ways in which young people construct and develop affiliations with STEM in their capacity as mentors, facilitators, and curators of STEM ideas and practices among younger youth. Additionally, the project outcomes seek to understand the design of formal and informal learning environments that support STEM identity development for youth of color by orienting to youth as knowledgeable experts and focusing on youth's ongoing pedagogical development as mentors in STEM.<br/> <br/>In partnership with two informal and two formal learning partners in the Boston area, this project will work with 140 young people, aged 14-24, 96% from communities of color, who participate in activities related to youth mentoring initiatives in STEM areas. These partners have a rich history of initiatives focused on developing high school and college youth mentors to work in STEM summer camps and juniors and seniors in high school to mentor freshmen and sophomores in mathematics and digital fabrication engineering. The project intends to investigate how youth mentors teach, where they are successful and where they need support, and to develop principles for professional learning opportunities for schools and out-of-school organizations. The project focuses, in particular, on understanding ?youth pedagogical development? (YPD), or youth?s ongoing process of learning to be mentors. Exploring YPD involves understanding youth?s learning of STEM ideas, literacies, and pedagogical strategies and how youth come to identify with STEM and STEM mentoring. Youth mentors can reach large numbers of learners, and more importantly they can connect deeply with other youth in meaningful ways. This participatory project draws on ethnographic and case study methods and employs areas of work shown to support broadening participation in STEM: a) prior research on youth as mentors in STEM learning; b) distributions of power and authority in formal and informal learning contexts; c) academic identity development; and d) STEM literacies. By collecting and analyzing data from four different contexts with organizations that have shared values and practices, including distributed authority for knowing, the partnership intends to understand program design principles that support students as mentors in regard to STEM literacies, learning, identity development, and pedagogy. By following youth mentors over two years, the case studies will highlight how STEM learning, identity building, and pedagogy are developed when youth participate as mentors in sustained ways over longer stretches of time. In addition to disseminating this work at academic conferences, the project will have a website that will be useful to other community groups and schools that utilize mentoring practices and will host a conference that will involve all partner organizations as well as groups from around the US who use mentoring to support STEM learning and identity development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cyberinfrastructure improvements will include: 1) a web-based interface for bulk-uploading metadata and data from many sites, 2) better support for specimen-level isotopic measurements, 3) better visualization and analytical support for micropaleontological species-environment calibration datasets, and 4) a rebuild of Neotoma?s home webpage. Sustainability priorities include: 1) support for the recently launched non-profit EarthLife Consortium Foundation, and 2) a workshop in which leaders from Neotoma and other community data resources will receive training in building strategic sustainability plans, learn tools to manage finances and plan for the future, develop strategies to diversify their funding base, and enhance communication skills. These updates and improvements to Neotoma will enhance the existing data resource for current users, and will help early-career researchers, for whom data availability and data-science training can open new career pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such times include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 21 thousand years ago (a colder time with lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) and the Pliocene Epoch 5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (a warmer time with higher carbon dioxide). These periods can be used to estimate the sensitivity of climate to changes in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Those sensitivity estimates help predict the amount of global warming we should expect to see in response to future greenhouse gas emissions. However, recent work has shown that the climate?s sensitivity to greenhouse gases depends not only on the average surface temperature change but also on the geographic pattern of that change. Thus, use of geological paleoclimate records to estimate future warming must account for how the spatial pattern of temperature changes in the past differs from that expected in the future. This project will combine information from paleoclimate data and climate models to evaluate the spatial pattern of surface temperature changes during the LGM and Pliocene. It will then develop methods to account for temperature pattern differences when using data from these past periods to help estimate future global warming.<br/><br/>Earth?s equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the change in average surface temperature associated with a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) relative to the pre-industrial atmosphere. The ECS is set by the radiative feedbacks that link surface warming to changes in the amount of radiation leaving Earth?s atmosphere. Recent studies have shown that global radiative feedbacks depend on the spatial pattern of sea-surface temperature (SST). Estimates of ECS based on the proxy record of past climate changes ? such as those during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Pliocene ?  have traditionally been based on global mean energy budget constraints and thus do not account for how SST patterns in those states may be different from those in the future. This research will use recently developed data assimilation techniques, combining information from climate models and proxies, to reconstruct gridded SST fields for the LGM and Pliocene that are dynamically consistent with available proxy data. These SST fields will then be compared against those projected by global climate models under CO2 forcing. The sensitivity of radiative feedbacks to differences between LGM / Pliocene and CO2-forced SST patterns will then be quantified using a suite of atmospheric general circulation models and Green?s functions that link warming patterns to radiative feedbacks. By producing estimates of LGM and Pliocene surface temperature patterns and quantifying the impact of temperature pattern differences on radiative feedbacks, this research will improve our understanding of ECS derived from those past climate states.

Consequently, biomaterials with structure and function tunable by shear represent powerful tools to detect and rectify pathological processes induced by abnormal flows in the body. For the past few decades, shear-responsive hydrogels and molecular assemblies have been widely explored. However, single-biomolecule based shear responders remains a poorly-tapped subject, despite such materials could better mimic natural functions in circulation, delivering more accurate spatial and temporal responses with function reversibility. This project will design and characterize novel Single-MOlecule based materials with switchable structures and functions REsponsive to Shear flows (SMORES). Owing to the modular design, the material concept can be generalized to other constructs capable of responding to abnormal flows in the circulatory system towards novel diagnostics and therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases in the long term. This project will provide fundamental insights into biomechanics of polymer devices under the influence of ligands and the flow environment, perspectives that have not been studied in depth before. Rational design of biomaterials containing both bio- and nonbio- functionalities to achieve predictable flow responses will advance the fields of materials science, biomechanics, bio-conjugation, molecular engineering and bio-transport. Knowledge from this work will enable new diagnostics and theranostics for hemostatic applications, advancing the national health. The PIs will actively recruit underrepresented students to their research and disseminated discoveries from the research broadly to the general public through various K12 outreach programs.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: The design is inspired by a coagulation molecule in circulation, the von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which executes its function of crosslinking platelets to damaged blood vessel wall at shear rates > 5,000 per sec. The function is switched on by conformational changes under high shear and is enabled by an extremely complicated molecular structure: vWF is comprised of tens to hundreds of monomer units, each of which contains more than ten domains. To demonstrate that an artificial material of modular design could achieve a similar function to vWF, i.e. binding cells at high shear, we propose the construction SMORES to inhibit or promote the cell binding activity of the vWF?s platelet binding domain under shear control. Shear dependent cell binding to the proposed material will be characterized and correlated with molecular conformations studied by single-molecular force spectroscopy, microfluidic imaging experiments and computer modeling. Besides demonstrating the material design concept, the proposed work will emphasize fundamental studies of single-molecule biomechanical behaviors in different biochemical environment, especially the presence and absence of ligands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recreating the transient, stimuli-dependent states of natural materials with synthetic constructs thus offers an approach to more precisely engineer replicates of natural materials in pursuit of more life-like materials. This CAREER award seeks to establish new routes to the creation of transient materials which will inform the future design of functional constructs and therapeutic devices. Specifically, materials for which formation and stability is dictated by the presence of a continuously consumed fuel source are envisioned, wherein the lifetime of the material is tunable through altering the dosage of applied fuel or changing the environmental conditions to which the material is exposed. Similarly, toward harnessing light as a fuel, other materials are envisioned which convert applied light into a directive cue driving transient material formation with tunable lifetime. Accessing transient states in soft materials, by way of chemical fuels or by using light, points to a new direction in the design of soft materials with enhanced functionality rooted in their nature-mimetic transient states, with uses in advancing a number of material applications. Integrated within this convergent research program is an ongoing effort to build and expand laboratory and classroom training in the area of molecular engineering, and an overarching goal to advance the practice of scientific communication through research, mentorship, community outreach, and experiential training for graduate trainees in the chemical and materials sciences.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Nature achieves remarkable function from materials which exist in dissipative non-equilibrium states; one must look no further than the cell structure and motility which arises from ATP-fueled non-equilibrium assembly of its actin cytoskeleton. Accordingly, this CAREER award integrates research and training in an effort to create bio-inspired materials with fuel-dependent formation and transient stability, and which subsequently dissipate when fuel is limited. Recreating the dissipative non-equilibrium states of natural materials with synthetic analogues has captivated many in recent years. While efforts have focused almost exclusively on fuel-dependent assembly of small molecules, a new paradigm is described here for fuel-dependent non-equilibrium formation of host?guest supramolecular hydrogels. This outcome will be achieved through recognition motifs which are dependent on a continuous supply of a consumable chemical fuel source, or by using light-responsive motifs to actuate a light stimulus into altered affinity and/or dynamics of the motif. When the specific chemical or light fuel sources are limited, these materials will exist transiently and dissipate to their designed equilibrium state of a sol or weak gel. More broadly, host?guest supramolecular recognition affords a useful class of soft materials which have properties directly attributed to the dynamic nature of their crosslinking interactions. These materials have thus exhibited a variety of useful emergent properties in their application as new biomaterials and therapeutic delivery devices, and also afford features desirable for a number of industrial applications. The ability to further integrate transient and fuel-dependent formation of this class of materials seeks increased biomimetic function to further expand on their possible uses. This research plan is placed within a multidisciplinary training environment tailored to train leaders in the convergent discipline of molecular engineering, which is further augmented by classroom instruction. In addition, training aimed at improving scientific communication in the chemical and materials sciences seeks to achieve improved public engagement conveying the importance of scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High entropy alloys (HEAs) are emerging as promising high strength and radiation-resistant materials as HEAs contain a mix of many elements that disrupt the chemical ordering. The focus of this research is to gain fundamental understanding at the atomic level on how the complexity of chemical disorder interferes with the formation and evolution of undesirable defects that weakens the material.  To gain these insights, state of the art analytical and imaging techniques will be used to reveal how an atomic sized defect in the material evolves and how the chemical disorder interferes and halts this undesirable process.  Such insights are needed to develop the optimal alloys with high radiation resistance, high strength and high stability that would not only enable new advanced power generating technologies with high efficiency and low or zero carbon emission but more generally, could transform many technical fields related to energy and space. Students working on the project will develop in-depth understanding on chemistry and physics of materials and defects in solids and gain experience in important techniques in material science. International student exchange and national internship opportunities are offered to the graduate students involved in the project. A wide range of research opportunities and outreach activities are provided to undergraduates and high school students throughout the period of the project where participation of underrepresented groups are actively encouraged. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>High entropy alloys (HEAs) are emerging as an outstanding class of materials due to their excellent mechanical properties and high radiation tolerance as a result of their unique electronic structure. Chemical disorder and compositional fluctuations in these alloys have large effects on energy dissipation and response to irradiation. While previous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and other studies showed that damage accumulation was suppressed by increasing chemical disorder, they could not reveal vacancy clusters below 2 nm leaving critical gap in understanding defect formation and buildup in these alloys.  The proposed research aims to experimentally monitor defect formation on atomistic scale and their buildup to large clusters and voids by combining in-situ and ex-situ positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) with in-situ and ex-situ TEM to capture isolated vacancies, small vacancy clusters, larger clusters and voids, thus bridge the gap between the atomic scale and mesoscale characterization of radiation induced defects in HEAs. The use of In-situ PAS and In-situ TEM measurements both coupled with ion irradiation offers a picture of the defect dynamics including production, annihilation and evolution, on atomic scale (for PAS) and mesoscale (for TEM). The proposed research is expected to reveal the effects of chemical disorder on defect formation, migration and evolution in a radiation environment and reveal the damage and annealing mechanisms in Single -Phase Concentrated Solid Solution alloys (SP-CSAs) and HEAs through the study of defect production from collision cascades on an atomic and mesoscale level in alloys with increasing chemical complexity from one to five constituents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the continuous case, this phenomena has been intensively studied for decades. If we average over objects in a discrete setting like the integers, or some other high dimensional lattice, the smoothing properties of the average have only recently started to be studied.  A natural object to study is the average over a discrete sphere in a five dimensional lattice. The proof that the average improves functions engages a range of deep aspects within number theory and analysis. However, resolving the natural limits for this question still seem difficult. In this project, these questions will be explored in a setting that involves both continuous and discrete phenomena.  These questions are also elementary to state, which makes them amenable for mentoring programs, from undergraduate through postdoctoral levels.  <br/><br/>An improving inequality in the continuous setting has been widely studied since the 1970's. However, the corresponding questions in the discrete setting have only just attracted attention. For instance, averages over the discrete sphere in the d-dimensional integers, with d at least 5, have a rich theory of improving inequalities, paralleling the much better known continuous case.  The proofs however involve complications arising from multi-frequency analysis, as well as fine estimates on Kloosterman sums. There is a richer theory, the outlines of which are appearing, giving a sharp range of inequalities for some arithmetic varieties.  This subject also allows for the proof of certain sparse bounds. The latter are scale-free versions of the improving inequalities. A sparse bound immediately implies other weighted and vector valued consequences.  The latter are new in this subject. These questions reveal new aspects of these averaging operators, and require new modes of investigation, deepening the connection between harmonic analysis and number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is central to understanding the functional specialization of living things, the origin of species diversity and the inherent unity of biological life. Despite the early emergence of tendencies that can make evolution increasingly challenging to learn over time, natural selection is currently not taught until middle or high school. This is long after patterns of misunderstanding are likely to have become more entrenched. The current research responds to this situation. It targets elementary school as the time to initiate comprehensive instruction on biological evolution. Adopting a teaching and curricular approach that will be novel in its integration of custom explanatory storybook materials with hands-on investigations, it seeks to promote third grade students? understanding of small- and large-scale evolution by natural selection. By studying students across multiple school districts, this research will shed light on the benefits to diverse students of instruction that focuses on supporting children?s capacities to cogently explain aspects of the biological world rather than learn disparate facts about it. It will also illuminate the value of simple tools, like explanatory storybooks, for elementary school teachers who are often expected to teach counterintuitive topics such as natural selection while not feeling confident in their own understanding. <br/><br/>This project will investigate changes in Grade 3 students? learning and reasoning about living things during implementation of a guided inquiry curriculum unit on evolution by natural selection that emphasizes causal-mechanistic explanation. Classroom inquiry activities and investigations into a range of real-world phenomena will be framed by engagement with a sequence of innovative custom causal-explanatory storybook, animation and writing prompt materials that were developed under prior NSF support to promote transferable, scientifically accurate theory- and evidence-based reasoning about natural selection. In response to the distinctive challenges of life science and evolution learning, the project will integrate and thematically unify currently disparate Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) content and practice standards to create a comprehensive unit that addresses all three NGSS dimensions and is accompanied by evidence-based approaches to teacher professional development (PD). Using a design based research  approach, and informed by cognitive developmental findings, this 4-year project will engage at least 700 students and their teachers and include partners from at least four school districts, Boston University, and TERC. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools.

Sustainability priorities include: 1) support for the recently launched non-profit EarthLife Consortium Foundation, and 2) a workshop in which leaders from Neotoma and other community data resources will receive training in building strategic sustainability plans, learn tools to manage finances and plan for the future, develop strategies to diversify their funding base, and enhance communication skills. These updates and improvements to Neotoma will enhance the existing data resource for current users, and will help early-career researchers, for whom data availability and data-science training can open new career pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They play a central role in all branches of mathematics. This NSF award supports research and education that contain several directions to study Dynamical Systems in the presence of large groups. These include dynamical properties in situations with many explicit or implicit symmetries. Such systems tend to attain additional special properties. Conversely, some dynamical properties can often serve as indications of rich underlying symmetries.  Educational impact of the project is through Ph.D. supervision, dissemination efforts, and high school outreach.<br/><br/>This research project will encompass a number of topics at the intersection of dynamical systems, group theory, geometry and operator algebras. The common theme of the research directions lies in the synthesis and interactions between these areas. Many of the aspects of these interactions involve rigidity, a phenomenon of robustness of a structure under perturbations. Specific projects are related to special phenomena in dynamical systems that occur in the presence of large groups, such as explicit or implicit symmetries, rigidity of certain exotic geometries, and applications of dynamical methods to geometry and analysis. The three main topics under consideration are: measure equivalence rigidity, the Lyapunov spectrum for random walks and generalizations, and the length spectrum for Gromov hyperbolic groups. One focus of this research is the application of dynamical methods in the study of group theory and geometry, and especially rigidity phenomena. The other focus will be the application of group theory to shed light on problems in dynamical systems and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crowdsourcing systems are built on private or public platforms and are a popular means of deploying a variety of tasks that require human intelligence. Task deployment on such platforms requires identifying appropriate deployment strategies to satisfy deployment parameters, provided by requesters as thresholds on quality, latency, and cost, and also requires analysis of the workforce that is available to undertake the deployed tasks. To date, task deployment remains a painstakingly manual process, as there is little to no help for requesters in deciding how to organize the workforce, in what style, and in what structure to satisfy deployment parameters. Consequently, requesters and workers are mostly confined to one platform, as there is no easy portability of deployment processes across platforms. This project investigates a middle layer that sits between multiple stakeholders in a crowdsourcing ecosystem to aid requesters in deploying crowdsourcing tasks by allowing easy and flexible specification of deployment constraints and goals, and then recommending deployment strategies based on those specifications. Development of this system thus enables the portability and reuse of deployment processes across platforms.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, this project develops a middleware system called SLOAN (Scalable, decLarative, Optimization-driven, Adaptive, and uNified) with three integrated components: (1) The Deployment Strategy Recommendation Engine is optimized to accommodate multi-stakeholders in the ecosystem, and is responsible for modeling and recommending deployment strategies to a batch of requests. (2) The Workforce Analytics Engine analyzes the available workforce and feeds to the Recommendation Engine, as the deployed tasks are to be undertaken by the workers. The outputs of this engine are estimations of workers' preferences or human factors, such as availability of the workers, as precise (discrete), or imprecise (intervals or probability distribution functions) information. (3) The Result Aggregation Module estimates the quality of the deployed tasks, and then feeds to the other two engines for readjustment. It is empowered by fully automated or hybrid algorithms that sparingly involve human intelligence inside machine algorithms. The development plan of SLOAN involves principled modeling, rigorous algorithm design, declarative framework development, deployment and integration inside multiple real world platforms. Different components of SLOAN are empowered with multi-objective discrete optimization and computational geometric algorithms, as well as multi-faceted modeling techniques adapted from machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is followed by physics-based prognostics, where model-based tracking is used to predict future degradation trajectories and remaining useful life. The resulting prognostics approach leverages a combination of physical knowledge and sensor data to achieve gains in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Recently, there has been considerable focus on a class of materials known as lead halide perovskites for applications in solar cells, but they may be limited by concerns about the toxicity of lead. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for the development of emerging classes of semiconductor materials which could show similarly promising properties, but without the corresponding drawbacks; they should be non-toxic, highly stable, solution-processible, and ideally composed of earth-abundant elements.   Many materials with potentially promising properties have been proposed computationally, but only a small subset have been realized experimentally.  This research project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, involves the development of new synthetic methods to access emerging and proposed inorganic semiconductors using solution synthesis. The project focuses on two classes of lead-free perovskite materials containing sulfur or selenium whose synthesis is currently either unknown or very limited.  The development of facile synthetic routes to these materials in solution allows for experimental validation of their properties and lays the groundwork for their potential application in solar cells or other devices.  Through their involvement in this project, graduate and undergraduate students are trained in materials chemistry and in renewable energy science, preparing them for future careers in energy research and green technology.  Concepts related to this work, and materials chemistry in general, are also being developed into coursework to reach a broader audience of students at Mississippi State University.<br/>  <br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This research project focuses on the development of two classes of chalcogenide-containing inorganic materials based on a perovskite lattice, which have been proposed as promising non-toxic and earth-abundant replacements for the hybrid lead halide perovskites, but whose synthesis is either unknown or underdeveloped. First, the research team is targeting the synthesis of chalcogenide perovskites including BaZrS3 and SrHfS3 as colloidal nanocrystals using solution synthesis approaches.  Synthetic methods include the use of reactive sulfide and metal precursors (e.g., trimethysilyl sulfide and metal alkoxides and amides), the use of single-source precursors such as metal dithiocarbamates and heterobimetallic metal thiolate clusters, and the sulfurization of oxide nanocrystals.  Synthesis as nanocrystals allows for the potential use of these materials as colloidal inks for solution-processing. Additionally, the research team is investigating the preparation of mixed-anion halide-chalcogenide perovskites such as CsBiSI2, CsSbSI2, and CsSnS2Cl, through approaches such as anion exchange on colloidal nanocrystals of chalcogenide or halide precursors.  Through this approach, it is possible to access compositions, structures, and morphologies that may be metastable and difficult or impossible to access through direct synthesis under thermal equilibrium conditions.  The materials prepared are characterized in terms of their compositional, structural, and optical properties and compared to computational predictions.

Although the phenomenon has been studied for many decades, the understanding of drop impact is still far from complete due to the complexity associated with typical fast impact processes. Significant progress has been made on drop impact in recent years using high-speed photographic techniques. Relying on direct imaging, most experiments focused on the kinematics of drop impact, i.e., the shape of impacting drops. Few studies have probed the dynamic properties of drop impact such as its impact force, pressure and shear stress. These dynamic quantities lead to the most important outcome of an impact event and affect a wide range of phenomena, including soil erosion, impact-induced wear/damage and the survival of living organisms exposed to the elements. The goal of this research is to conduct a systematic study on mapping the dynamic aspects of drop impact under different conditions. The research will develop a new experimental technique, 3D high-speed stress microscopy, to measure the impact force, pressure, and shear stress of drop impact with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The project will provide a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of drop impact in unexplored regimes and a practical guideline to control impact forces and mitigate impact-induced damage on solid substrates. The project will also provide a unique opportunity to introduce frontier research in undergraduate curriculum and forge collaborations with coating companies. <br/><br/>By combining traction force microscopy with high-speed photography, the research will construct a 3D high-speed stress microscope to measure the temporal variation of pressure and shear stress distributions beneath an impacting drop during a fast impact process. With the new technique, the project will verify previous theoretical predictions, including the singular dynamics of off-center pressures, the scaling relation of drag forces, and the propagation of boundary layers in spreading drops. As such, the study will reveal the dynamics of drop impact in spatiotemporal regimes, inaccessible to conventional kinematic measurements. Moreover, the research will examine the influence of different surface properties such as stiffness, wettability, and micro-textures on the stress distributions. The study aims to seek optimal surface designs, which can substantially reduce impact-induced wear and damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this reason, plant microbiomes?which mostly come from soil?have great potential to help improve agricultural productivity and restore damaged ecosystems. Because microbiomes are so complex, it is unclear how and why they affect plants. Part of the answer may lie in the evolutionary histories of plants and their microbiomes, which share a habitat and therefore must adapt to the same environmental stresses, such as drought. The research funded by this award will test the hypotheses that (1) drought-adapted soil microbiomes help plants tolerate drought, and (2) drought-adapted plants help soil microbes survive drought. DNA sequencing will be used to identify differences in drought-adapted versus non-adapted soil microbiomes. Then, physiological and biochemical techniques, such as CT-scanning of root structures, will reveal the effects of those drought-adapted and non-adapted microbiomes on plant health. These experiments will be done using both corn and Eastern Gamagrass, a native species. This research has the potential to improve current methods for predicting the effects of soil microbes on plant health, and thus impact agriculture and conservation practices. This award will also grow the American scientific workforce by supporting the training of one post-doctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student researcher, and two undergraduate student researchers. Finally, this award supports a portable museum exhibit that brings scientific content to hundreds of people in rural communities across Kansas.<br/>	<br/>This project is motivated by the lack of knowledge of how adaptation to a shared environmental stressor affects plant-microbiome interactions. Because root microbiomes are derived from soil, the constituent microbial lineages encounter environmental stressors both with and without a host. Whether the same microbial genes and traits contribute to stress tolerance and survival in both situations, or whether there is a fitness tradeoff between host-associated vs. free-living stages is not clear. Similarly, it is unknown whether microbiome adaptation to a given environmental challenge impacts the ability of a plant host to withstand the same challenge.  To address these questions, drought will be used as a model stressor. First, shotgun metagenome sequencing of soils from across two natural precipitation gradients will characterize how historical water limitation shapes community-wide gene content, after controlling for variation in soil structure and chemical content measured using 3D X-ray CT and ICP-MS, respectively. Second, repeated metagenome and metatranscriptome sequencing will test for changes in the frequency and expression of microbial genes in natural soils after six months of experimentally induced drought. This experiment will be replicated in mesocosms both with and without plant hosts. Finally, the effects of drought-adapted and non-adapted soil microbiomes on plant physiology and drought tolerance will be measured using growth assays, RNA-seq, ionomics, and laser ablation tomography. This research may disentangle the genetic, physiological, and ecological interdependencies that shape the evolution of plant microbiomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interactions occur in many different situations, for example, individuals can be in physical proximity, have negative, or positive interactions, etc. Each of these situations provides a different contribution to the structure of a society, yet often such situations are studied separately. Furthermore, physical constraints, such as geographical barriers and man-made structures can impact who interacts with whom. Such physical features are seldom considered when examining social interactions. This work will develop tools to integrate different social situations and physical constraints into a single framework, allowing us to uncover the causes and consequences of social interactions. The researchers will implement these new tools to study how social and physical features impact disease dynamics in griffon vultures. In the study population nearly every individual can be monitored to obtain information on their movements and social interactions. The investigators will make new tools widely available to the general public and the scientific community. This study system has conservation importance because vultures are an umbrella species that provide ecosystem services (e.g., sanitation), and thus have financial and public health implications. A wildlife tracking app will be developed to alert wildlife managers when tagged animals perform unexpected behavior. Such a tool can be used in any system in which wildlife can be tracked remotely. Thus, this work will have both conservation implications and will develop analysis tools that will define how scientists social interactions, including those of humans.<br/><br/>Animals interact with their physical and social environments in ways that impact their fitness.

One such calendar, called the astronomical time scale, makes use of the fact that predictable changes in the orbits of the planets drive cyclic changes in Earth?s climate. In this approach observed cycles in sediment composition are matched to climate cycles. The timing of those cycles is then calculated by computing planetary orbits backward in time. The astronomical time scale is a valuable tool because the orbital calculations provide accurate ages for the geologic record. Recent work by the PI provided new astronomical calculations that stretch back to 58 million years before the present (Myr BP). Those calculations were then compared with deep sea sediment records. The comparisons yielded a new history of climate events during the early Eocene (56 to 53 Myr BP). They also yielded new information about the chaotic motions of the solar system. The proposed study will provide a fully tested astronomical time scale and new astronomical calculations extending back through the Paleocene (66 to 56 Myr BP). The astronomical calculations will provide a time scale for the sediment records. At the same time the cyclic patterns observed in the sediments will constrain calculations of the planets? orbital variations. That new time scale will pave the way to an accurate time scale extending back through the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 Myr BP). It will also help improve dating methods that use radioactive elements. Finally, it will improve our knowledge of the chaotic evolution of our solar system. The project will also support a graduate student.<br/><br/>The development of an astronomical time scale (ATS) based on astronomical solutions has transformed the dating of geologic archives and represents the backbone of marine cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology to reconstruct Earth?s history. While the stable 405-kyr cycle of Earth?s orbital eccentricity has been used to provide floating (relative) chronologies across various time scales, one major challenge remains: Development of an absolute, fully calibrated astronomical time scale beyond ~50 Ma, which has hitherto been hampered by the fact that orbital solutions disagree before that age due to solar system chaos. We have recently made progress in providing a new astronomical solution to ~58 Ma by testing against deep-sea sediment archives (~58-53 Ma), which also yielded critical insight into the chronology of early Eocene hyperthermals and solar system chaos. This project will develop and provide a fully calibrated ATS and a new astronomical solution including the Paleocene (~66-56 Ma), which, combined with our recent work, will then span the entire Cenozoic. The key idea of our study is to use marine geology to constrain astronomy, and, conversely, use astronomy to provide key applications widely used in marine geology. Reaching beyond 58 Ma presents new challenges, which will require analyses of multiple geologic records and significant computational resources. Cyclostratigraphic signals are challenging to interpret in deep-sea records across the interval ~66-63 Ma, for which we will integrate land-based marine sections in our analysis (e.g., Zumaia, Spain). The expression of Earth?s orbital eccentricity in the geologic archives will then guide our search for an astronomical solution, using numerical (ensemble) integrations of the orbital motion of the solar system. Specifically, we will use marine deep-sea records of color reflectance and iron intensities from ODP Sites 1262 and 1209 and cyclostratigraphy from land-based marine sections (Zumaia) to reconstruct Earth?s orbital eccentricity across the critical interval ~66-56 Ma. Based on the eccentricity expression observed in the records, we will search for a new astronomical solution that will allow us to extend the fully calibrated astronomically time scale to ~66 Ma. In summary, our study will (1) provide a fully calibrated ATS across the Cenozoic, (2) help gauge radiometric dating calibrations, (3) test correlations between eccentricity amplitude modulation and Paleocene climate events, (4) model forcing of Paleocene climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, and (5) transform our knowledge of the chaotic evolution of our solar system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We hypothesize that the proposed project will contribute to the development of a diverse workforce by exposing URGs to real-world STEM problems through successful cross-sector partnerships with corporations and organizations. With this project, which deeply involves faculty and students? families, we will investigate how cultural and social networks created from cross-sector partners support student success. We will examine how to form meaningful partnerships between faculty research mentors, external internship supervisors, and families to support student retention in STEM academic programs and sense of belonging in STEM careers. The findings will be disseminated and guide other institutions in best practices in involving families in STEM students? academic and professional activities. Improving the outcomes of URG students in STEM is essential as the need for STEM professionals will continue to increase and diverse workforces are more creative and more productive. To improve sense of inclusion, we place students on diverse teams. Most research and innovation in STEM is conducted by teams, which have been proven to have better problem-solving skills when diverse. Institutions of higher education, including HSIs, will benefit from tools that result in optimal outcomes for URG STEM majors.<br/><br/>Developing a new framework for promoting success among URGs in STEM fields may well change the trajectory for successful outcomes for students. Understanding what changes to make to the framework is essential. Our work will contribute to this understanding. This project will use surveys, focus groups, and interviews to study how cultural and social norms among Hispanic populations promote or inhibit student interest in specific career pathways, and if, or how, family norms support (or detract from) student persistence and graduation. A new STEM family survey instrument will be developed, validated and disseminated. The findings will reveal best practices in balancing any STEM-negative influences, educating families on STEM and STEM careers, and involving family members in students? academic and professional trajectories. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015) data tells us that URGs are underrepresented in STEM fields. Further, demand for individuals in STEM career pathways continues to grow. This project will help guide and inform institutions of higher education in the design of programs that build on the enrollment gains from URGs and support students to persist, graduate, and enter STEM fields. Research into strategies that support improved persistence and graduation rates are essential to satisfying the unmet demand for STEM-focused, trained professionals.

Research shows that interventions that ?root? students in a community and ?grow? their self-perception as STEM scholars positively impact retention and graduation rates. Working at scale, this project will build interventions into the first-year curriculum for all freshmen natural sciences and mathematics (NSM) majors at a large comprehensive university (estimated impact: 500-600 students per year). All NSM freshmen will enroll in a unique, multidisciplinary course that blends instruction in critical thinking/scientific reasoning with course-based interventions to enhance traits of self-efficacy, identity, and belonging, and a seminar course highlighting undergraduate research opportunities and STEM career exploration; all variables associated with long-term student success. Student transitions to STEM careers will be facilitated through a new collaboration between the NSM departments and the campus office for internship. The capacity of faculty from NSM and local two-year institutions to support underrepresented STEM majors will be enhanced through training in inclusive teaching and reinforced by a training colloquium for STEM educators from partner institutions. <br/><br/>This research-based project will involve five NSM departments and will impact all NSM majors. The proposed research will add to the current knowledge base through an investigation of three hypotheses: retention and graduation rates for STEM majors are enhanced by multidisciplinary, course-based experiences that combine academic content with psychosocial and NSM community-building activities; STEM-related internships contribute to retention and graduation goals; and faculty training improves retention by enhancing the STEM learning environment while creating opportunities for STEM education scholarship. Assessment of critical thinking skills and psychosocial traits will be achieved using validated survey instruments. Retention and graduation data will be collected from the campus office of institutional research.

Useful applications range from aircraft to automobiles to bridges.  These structural materials are composed of microscopic crystals called grains.  The sizes, shapes, and orientations of grains control a material's mechanical properties, such as strength and ductility.  These microscopic features, part of the material microstructure, are determined by the manufacturing processes that produce and shape materials into useful machine components.  Manufacturing frequently requires deformation at elevated temperatures, the modern equivalent of hot forging by the ancient blacksmith, to control the material microstructure and final component shape.  During hot deformation, grains change size and shape in ways that we cannot yet predict or fully explain.  This project addresses the fundamental science behind the changes in grain shape, size, and orientation during hot deformation.  The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms responsible for these changes.  Through this scientific understanding, opportunities are sought to: 1. improve material performance and 2. identify manufacturing methods that create improved material microstructures.  Both graduate and undergraduate students are educated and trained through experimental research.  Primary-school teachers are provided summer research experience, training, and resources to bring to their classrooms.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Dynamic grain growth involves changes in grain shape, size, and orientation during deformation at elevated temperatures.  It is critically important to the processing of many technologically useful metals and alloys.  However, the mechanisms that cause it are not yet understood.  This experimental study assesses the leading hypothesis among several proposed for mechanisms that control dynamic grain growth.  The hypothesized mechanism of subgrains driving high-angle grain boundary migration is investigated for (mechanically) steady-state plastic deformation of body-centered-cubic metals at elevated temperatures.  The goal of this study is to characterize and quantitatively measure the effects of subgrain interactions with high-angle boundaries during both dynamic normal grain growth and dynamic abnormal grain growth.  Recent advances in high-resolution analysis of electron back-scattered diffraction data are leveraged to provide quantitative characterization of subgrain interactions with grain boundaries.  An improved understanding of dynamic grain growth will provide capabilities for predicting and controlling material microstructures during hot deformation processing.  This will benefit manufacturing and domestic competitiveness.  Integrated with the proposed research are training and educational activities for both graduate and undergraduate students. Outreach involves primary-school teachers participating in a summer program of research experience and curriculum development to positively impact their own students.  This outreach focuses on imparting an accessible understanding of materials through hands-on projects and examples that utilize the aesthetic beauty of microstructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ventricular arrhythmias alone are responsible for 300,000 sudden cardiac deaths in the United States per year. The development of effective therapeutic and diagnostic approaches requires detailed understanding of the complex underlying pathophysiology of heart failure and arrhythmias. However, this is limited by available experimental cardiovascular electrophysiology technologies. This multidisciplinary project will develop the next generation of wireless multifunctional optoelectronic array tools for cardiac monitoring and modulation. Such a technology is critical for developmental, structural, and functional cardiac studies. It will lead to new insights in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis and facilitate the development of therapeutic/diagnostic options for various types of arrhythmias and heart failure. This multidisciplinary project will be integrated with educational/outreach activities, including adopting the results of this project into various courses being taught at the George Washington University, hands-on research training for undergraduate students from different disciplinary programs, and directly engaging underrepresented K-12 students. Results from this project will also be used in The George Washington University Pre-College Summer Immersion Program to boost underrepresented high school students' interests in biomedical engineering.<br/><br/>Current cardiac electrophysiology research is often based on acute in vitro and ex vivo experiments using cardiomyocytes or explanted hearts. Chronic in vivo cardiovascular studies on awake, freely behaving animals will offer some of the greatest areas of opportunity for understanding the complex pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The goal of the project is to develop wireless, implantable optogenetic modulation and electrical sensing arrays to enable significant new opportunities for basic and translational cardiovascular studies with freely behaving animal subjects. This project includes three research objectives: (1) Develop cellular scale flexible transparent microelectrode arrays with superior electrochemical, optical, and mechanical properties for high-resolution electrophysiology. Efficient biocompatible encapsulation strategies will be explored for studying chronic disease models using the microelectrode arrays. (2) Design wireless, subdermally implantable, multifunctional, multisite microsystems consisting of transparent microelectrode arrays and microscale inorganic light-emitting diodes for simultaneous crosstalk-free electrophysiological recording and optogenetic modulation. (3) Validate the microsystems by studying the roles of specific cardiomyocytes and multisite pacing strategies in ventricular arrhythmias termination and in heart failure in freely moving mouse models. The wireless features of the devices will minimize adverse effects (e.g. motion artifacts, severe tissue damages, etc.) of conventional tethered, wired techniques associated with fiber optic cables and electrical wires. The proposed work will build upon the principal investigators' expertise in innovative materials, bioelectronic device fabrications, circuit designs, and cardiovascular physiology. The multifunctional implantable array tools will offer cardiovascular research community currently unavailable technological platforms for chronic research into the basic operating principles of cardiovascular physiology on freely moving animals and allow future development of therapeutic/diagnostic approaches in clinical medicine.

Among these include processes that are not only associated with the immune system, but those also required for growth, development, reproduction and senescence. In this regard, plant immunity is not a narrowly defined process, but rather, a broader, integrated mechanism that uses the entire cell (and organism) to respond to pathogen infection. This research will ultimately define how plant stress signals are recognized, decoded, translated, and communicated to the whole plant. From this, insight into how signals from the outside are perceived and lead to the generation of genetically-encoded responses, internally, will be gained. The project employs a combination of microscopy-based techniques and biochemistry to uncover the signals that plants use to defend against pathogen infection. With this knowledge, the investigators will learn how plants determine if a signal is from a friend or a foe, and from this, determine how plants regulate the immune system. The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover the mechanisms that plants use to survive in environments where the threat of pathogen infection is high, and moreover, when environmental conditions favor the pathogen. The research team will also actively communicate to the public the link between basic research and agriculture. To do this, the scientists working on this project, including experts in heath and nutrition at Michigan State University will partner with the Lansing Capital Area library system to will educate young children ? and their families ? on topics related to food production and nutrition.<br/><br/>As a key component of the surveillance function of the immune system of both plants and animals, the actin cytoskeleton is required for cellular response to a variety of pathogen-derived elicitors. Additionally, a role for actin is emerging which includes the coordinated regulation of cellular processes that signal host defense, resistance, susceptibility, and cell death. While conclusive evidence demonstrating that the plant cytoskeleton directly interacts with individual immune receptors is lacking, an abundance of data in mammalian systems does exist; this includes a role for the pathogen-recognition receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 1 (NOD1), which requires F-actin for proper PM localization. Further, the interaction(s) between NOD1 and actin serves as an immune interface which influences actin-remodeling and control of downstream signaling, including the phospho-dependent activation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. This project will define the relationships that link the first line of plant defense (pattern-triggered immunity) to a complex and pervasive macromolecular structure ? the cytoskeleton ? to drive surveillance. The proposed research will contribute new insights in cell signaling across eukaryotic systems through the characterization and definition of the poorly understood mechanism by which cell structure and orchestration of pathogen recognition regulates signaling and immunity in plants. High school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students will be involved in the proposed work, and engage in cross-disciplinary training in the biological sciences utilizing traditional and contemporary methods necessary for success in modern biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High entropy alloys (HEAs) are emerging as promising high strength and radiation-resistant materials as HEAs contain a mix of many elements that disrupt the chemical ordering. The focus of this research is to gain fundamental understanding at the atomic level on how the complexity of chemical disorder interferes with the formation and evolution of undesirable defects that weakens the material.  To gain these insights, state of the art analytical and imaging techniques will be used to reveal how an atomic sized defect in the material evolves and how the chemical disorder interferes and halts this undesirable process.  Such insights are needed to develop the optimal alloys with high radiation resistance, high strength and high stability that would not only enable new advanced power generating technologies with high efficiency and low or zero carbon emission but more generally, could transform many technical fields related to energy and space. Students working on the project will develop in-depth understanding on chemistry and physics of materials and defects in solids and gain experience in important techniques in material science. International student exchange and national internship opportunities are offered to the graduate students involved in the project. A wide range of research opportunities and outreach activities are provided to undergraduates and high school students throughout the period of the project where participation of underrepresented groups are actively encouraged. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>High entropy alloys (HEAs) are emerging as an outstanding class of materials due to their excellent mechanical properties and high radiation tolerance as a result of their unique electronic structure. Chemical disorder and compositional fluctuations in these alloys have large effects on energy dissipation and response to irradiation. While previous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and other studies showed that damage accumulation was suppressed by increasing chemical disorder, they could not reveal vacancy clusters below 2 nm leaving critical gap in understanding defect formation and buildup in these alloys.  The proposed research aims to experimentally monitor defect formation on atomistic scale and their buildup to large clusters and voids by combining in-situ and ex-situ positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) with in-situ and ex-situ TEM to capture isolated vacancies, small vacancy clusters, larger clusters and voids, thus bridge the gap between the atomic scale and mesoscale characterization of radiation induced defects in HEAs. The use of In-situ PAS and In-situ TEM measurements both coupled with ion irradiation offers a picture of the defect dynamics including production, annihilation and evolution, on atomic scale (for PAS) and mesoscale (for TEM). The proposed research is expected to reveal the effects of chemical disorder on defect formation, migration and evolution in a radiation environment and reveal the damage and annealing mechanisms in Single -Phase Concentrated Solid Solution alloys (SP-CSAs) and HEAs through the study of defect production from collision cascades on an atomic and mesoscale level in alloys with increasing chemical complexity from one to five constituents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Copepods, small crustaceans, are the most abundant animals in the ocean; consequently, they play crucial roles in plankton marine food webs and in the transfer of energy to fishes.  Many species of copepods are able to choose between prey such as microscopic plants and single-celled animals. The choice affects how energy moves through marine food webs. Past work suggests that increasing temperature should favor herbivory over carnivory. This project is investigating whether this prediction holds in the face of genetic adaptation to warming in highly seasonal systems such as coastal temperate zones. Results from this study are contributing to understanding and predicting the response of marine ecosystems to future climate conditions, as well as for planning and implementing sustainable fisheries management plans. Other broader impacts include the development of learning modules for high school and college students. Hands-on science exhibits for K-6 students and public presentations at established lecture series focus on the role of copepods in marine food webs in coastal habitats.   <br/><br/>Predicting responses of the oceanic biota to climate change is limited not only by an incomplete understanding of how warming affects ecological interactions and evolutionary dynamics individually, but also by how these two factors interact. Copepods are both grazers of phytoplankton and predators of microzooplankton in marine systems. Increasing temperatures may drive a large-scale shift in the diet of omnivorous copepods towards stronger herbivory, with significant consequences for the structure of marine food webs and the control of primary productivity. However, thermal adaptation may moderate or even nullify these shifts. This project examines the interactive role ecological and evolutionary dynamics plays in shaping grazing and individual fitness in a warming ocean. The main goals of the project are to: 1) quantify seasonal variation in thermal performance curves in dominant coastal copepod species; 2) determine whether observed seasonal variation in thermal performance is caused by genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity; 3) assess how temperature affects respiration and protein synthesis rates, selective feeding, and individual fitness; and 4) determine how changes in the thermal performance curve, via both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity, affect the relationship between temperature and food preference. Selective feeding experiments are being paired with measurements of egg production and hatching success across a wide range of temperatures to measure thermal effects on feeding selectivity and individual fitness. Finally, genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity on temperature sensitivity is being investigated across populations from environments that differ in their thermal regime. The outcomes of this project contribute to the parameterization of models that forecast fisheries dynamics in response to climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project explores new approaches to electronics used in electrical circuits and computers. Specifically, the project evaluates the electrical conductivity of molecules containing chains of metal atoms. New metal-containing compounds are being prepared that have a linear, wire-like structure. These molecular wires are only one metal atom thick, making them the thinnest circuit connection possible. In order to test these molecular wires, three design aspects are being tested. One aim is examining new molecules to attach the metal chains to electrodes. The linker group, a sort of a chemical solder, must attach strongly to both the wire and to the electrode. A second aim focuses on modifying the chemical sheathing that surrounds the wire, which affects the energies (voltage) of the electrons within the wire. The third aim is exploring diverse metals that comprise the wire itself. Of interest is the influence of particular metals that may change the conductivity or resistance of the wire. This research provides students with hands-on experience. A number of artistic and scientific outreach efforts are underway to encourage curiosity and public awareness of this area of science.

The project examines the electrical properties of compounds containing one-dimensional metal atom chains. The most synthetically versatile class of such compounds are the extended metal atom chains (EMACs) and heterometallic extended metal atom chains (HEMACs), particularly those supported by 2,2?-dipyridylamide (dpa) and related ligands.  The researchers probe and tune electron delocalization. The broader goal is to assess the utility of these wire-like compounds as nanoscale components in molecular circuitry. The team collaborates with physical chemistry groups to assess electron delocalization in new HEMACs. A major goal is to assess the hypothesis that electron transport through HEMACs is gated by intramolecular, low-energy metal-metal stretching vibrations. To support these collaborative efforts, specific synthetic experiments are designed to assess fundamental properties related to single-molecule conductance: anchor group effects, modulation of frontier orbital energies for electron/hole transport, and systematic tuning of the metal atoms within the chains for molecular rectification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the reliability of self-driving cars is a crucial step to ensuring that the impending ubiquity of self-driving cars causes as few fatalities as possible. Components like actuators, sensors, and computational elements that make up such systems have inherent vulnerabilities to faults due to manufacturing defects, aging, cyberattacks, and environmental factors. Repair and replacement of such components may reduce the risk of fault occurrences, but may be infeasible in terms of cost, safety, and availability. Alternately, certain faults and their false positives may trigger unnecessary repair or cause unnecessary reactions by the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify faults in real time. This research will facilitate the development of in-the-field error mitigation techniques, resulting in more reliable autonomous cars. Furthermore, this research will support the technical development and engagement of an underrepresented cohort of graduate and undergraduate students at North Carolina A&T State University and North Carolina Central University through curriculum enhancements and participation in extracurricular activities such as the AutoDrive Challenge, a national self-driving car competition.<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide real-time diagnosis of transient, intermittent, and permanent faults that occur in a self-driving car. This analysis will substantially improve the performance and accuracy of fault classification/identification in complex systems. Multi-perspective error detection techniques, including discrete-event system analysis, data-driven analysis, and chip-level analysis, will be combined to diagnose faults in automotive systems. The discrete-event system analysis will detect and isolate a system's fault occurrences from external observation of general behaviors of the system and in the absence of full observation of occurred events. The data-driven analysis will use a novel fuzzy type-2 clustering-based method to detect whether a fault degraded performance. The chip-level analysis will detect when a computational component is malfunctioning based on equivalence checking of logic signals and state traces. The combination of these approaches will facilitate fault diagnosis of automotive systems in real-time and with greater accuracy and speed. The multi-perspective analysis will improve the understanding of how each perspective interacts with the other and has the potential to identify new fault types and patterns. The enhanced awareness created by integrating these three unique methods will facilitate automotive system fault diagnosis in real time with greater accuracy and speed than could be achieved by any of the methods individually.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

If an enzyme involved in breaking down a carbon source is efficient but expensive to synthesize, in terms of energy, the reaction step it catalyzes may be rate limiting. This rate limiting step may dictate if or to what extent the microbe is able to live on the specific carbon source or whether it needs to have a secondary carbon source to survive. The project reveals the specific metabolic pathways (i.e., genes and enzymes) involved in breaking down a specific carbon source in the presence or absence of oxygen. A computer model is generated to predict the rate limiting step(s) in this process. These predictions are experimentally investigated to probe the role of specific genes under optimal growth conditions. The results of this project will enable biotechnologists to predictably and efficiently convert one of the most abundant waste products (i.e., lignin) to useful bioproducts (e.g., a biodegradable polymer). In addition, a major goal of this project is to improve the public perception of science literacy through a well-developed education platform targeting all audiences (from preschoolers to retired adults). The education activities include designing a series of biology books as well as interactive activities for preschoolers and mentoring middle/high school and undergraduate students to advance STEM education. Graduate students are trained broadly in the integrated nature of computation-driven experimentation to address relevant biological questions.  In order to improve support and awareness for science, public lectures and interactive activities/demonstrations are also organized. <br/><br/>This project addresses how a metabolically versatile purple non-sulfur bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, controls the catabolic pathways of lignin-derived compounds and connects these pathways with other biological processes. Although existing literature shows it has five annotated pathways (comprising of enzymes of broad substrate specificities) for catabolizing these compounds, how or if the bacterium is able to catabolize some of the major lignin-derived compounds or even polymeric lignin is unknown. There is also a lack of understanding of how sensitive the enzymes are in the presence/absence of oxygen and if there is a need for complementation by a secondary carbon source. The goal of this project is to integrate computational modeling with experimental approaches to address these critical gaps, and consequently unlocking the fundamental rules that allow the bacterium to adapt to a wide range of conditions and substrates. Relative contributions of catabolic reactions and associated genes/proteins are determined through a metabolism and expression (ME) model. This model is developed from available genome annotations and information derived from transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics data that will be obtained in this project. A synthetic biology toolbox, including inducible promoters, will be used to probe the role of key/limiting genes in pathways of interest. Findings from this project contribute to iterative ME model improvement through design-build-test-refine cycles for a more quantitative and mechanistic understanding of lignin-derived compound catabolism in microbes. In addition the project will be the vehicle for improving the public perception of science literacy, and developing education platform targeting to a wide range of audiences, from preschoolers to retired adults.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They operate without monitoring, do not emit pollution, and can be made from earth-abundant and non-toxic materials. The use of solar energy is rapidly growing, but it still accounts for only a small fraction of electricity production. To increase their share of the energy market, the cost of making and operating solar cells must be decreased and their efficiency must increase. Carrier-selective passivating contacts hold the promise of doing just that. Such contacts increase cell efficiency by reducing electrical losses at the interface between the layer of a solar cell that absorbs light and the metal contacts that extract electrical current. This project will use a unique way to improve the fundamental understanding and control of loss mechanisms in solar cells with such contacts. Laser processing provides a way to electrically activate carrier-selective passivating contacts by selectively depositing laser energy into a selected layer with fine control at high speed. This process has the potential to increase the power conversion efficiency of solar cells while maintaining low temperature and high throughput, thereby decreasing the cost per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. The generated knowledge will improve various types of solar power generating as well as other electronic and photonic devices. The proposal brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team with expertise in solar cell fabrication, laser processing, and atomic-scale characterization. The PIs will engage in extensive outreach to local high schools, museums, and libraries. The economic impact will be amplified through work with solar cell manufacturing companies. This project will help society meet its future energy needs using fewer resources at a reduced cost while preventing pollution and climate change.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>This project encompasses carrier-selective passivating contact development, photovoltaic device fabrication, laser processing, and imaging at the atomic level using transmission electron microscopy. Carrier-selective passivating contacted (CSPC) devices are a promising next generation technology for photovoltaic devices because they eliminate the two primary loss mechanisms: the direct metal contact to silicon and dopant diffusion into the bulk. A fundamental understanding of the interface quality, dopant type, dopant activation (and potential diffusion), tunneling mechanism, and the effect of the passivation layer is still lacking. Through a combination of device modeling, fabrication and laser processing experiments, and transmission electron microscopy studies, the quantitative degree of CSPC band bending and band gaps; effect of thermal crystallization on optical absorption, implied open-circuit voltage and defect content; and independent control of dopant activation, crystallization, grain growth, and dopant diffusion will be investigated to provide the photovoltaic industry a better understanding of CSPC for is manufacturing adoption. The novelty of the aim of this study lies in the use of pulsed laser processing of CSPC to provide a non-contact way of annealing the device with surface heating only. This work will provide a fundamental understanding of the interface properties at the atomic and nanoscale level and relate these studies to the optical and electronic properties as well as to device performance of a full-area state-of-the-art CSPC device. This project will have a broad impact by training an interdisciplinary, interuniversity, and diverse team of graduate and undergraduate students across two universities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They impact aspects of climate, help to sustain life, and influence societal needs such as drinking water, food security, and economics. In Panamá, a specific concern is the impact of rainfall on the functioning of the Panamá Canal. Rainfall and river discharge (Q) are strongly linked in Panamá, and they play a crucial role in the sustained success of the canal. Rainfall totals across Panamá consistently place it in the top five countries for annual rainfall, but when major droughts occur, the Panama Canal Authority places restrictions on ship traffic to conserve water so that the canal can continue to operate. Panamá has a well-known seasonal variability in precipitation, with a wet season that lasts from about May through November. However, little is known about rainfall variation on longer time scales, on the order of decades or centuries. In addition, it is not clear how El Niño events may influence Panamanian rainfall, though there are suggestions of a relationship between El Niño strength and drought severity. These questions are hard to address because instrumental data, particularly river discharge records, are short and often unreliable ? we need a longer-term perspective. The chemistry of coral skeletons can preserve records of climate conditions and climate variability; these chemical records are called climate proxies. This project will use coral climate proxies to reconstruct hydrologic variability along the Pacific Coast of Panamá over the past ~300 years at near-monthly resolution. The final product will be a multi-coral, multi-proxy record that can be used to identify the frequency and strength of events such as droughts or El Niño. This project includes support for 8 female undergraduates and 1 Ph.D. student. Results from this project will be incorporated into a teaching workshop for middle and high school educators and will also be shared with water resource managers in Panamá. <br/><br/>Many tropical nations are subjected to intense variation in precipitation with extreme seasonality. Meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is largely responsible for this variability, with northward movement during the boreal summer and a southward shift during the austral summer. In the Pacific, El Niño and other less well constrained decadal and century-scale modes of ocean- atmosphere variability also dictate regional climate. In Panamá, a country whose rainfall and river discharge (Q) are tightly coupled, understanding hydrologic variability is of the utmost importance when considering the potential impacts on the Panamá Canal, whose functioning relies solely on hydraulic head differences between the canal locks and the Gatun Lake reservoir. Therefore, the probability of anomalous hydrologic conditions, such as drought and flooding, must be well defined. However, the lack of long instrumental records of tropical hydrology (i.e.; rainfall and Q) limits our ability to develop a rigorous understanding of drought and flood recurrence intervals. These issues raise the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between El Niño Southern Oscillation and droughts and flooding in Panamá? 2) Can we identify droughts and flood years that are not related to El Niño? And 4) Has there been multi-decadal or long-term secular changes in Q in Panamá and what climatic processes are involved? Preliminary results indicate that barium/calcium (Ba/Ca) time-series data from a coral core collected in 1984 at Secas Island in the Gulf of Chiriquí (GoC) along the Pacific Coast of Panamá has a remarkably strong correlation with Q from two major nearby rivers. Given these encouraging results, we will be completing the Ba/Ca analyses of the Secas Island core back to 1707 CE and to analyze a new GoC coral core collected in 2018. The final near- monthly resolved composite Ba/Ca record of Q will extend from 2018 to 1707 CE. By pairing Ba/Ca and ?18O on the same 1mm samples we can separately evaluate salinity and sea surface temperature changes in the GoC over the last 311 years. These paleo-Q and salinity reconstructions will provide a comprehensive history of Panamanian hydroclimate that can be exploited to track protracted deviations from average conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is motivated by the need to understand nanomaterials and large molecular structures. In-depth understanding of how such structures and materials interact with light, current and heat in applications such as electronics, batteries  and medical devices requires theoretical and computational methods capable of spanning several orders of magnitude in time, space, and hierarchy. Professor Garashchuk's research starts at the most fundamental level possible, for example, by examining protons. The more advanced computational descriptions (quantum calculations) that are restricted to just a few atomic nuclei at a time due to computational cost are merged with simpler classical representations for more complex, bigger and heavier nuclei. The atomistic simulations yield experimentally relevant properties such as predictions of the speed of the reaction or charge and energy transport rates.  These parameters are necessary for the development of even more advanced models of bigger molecular systems.  Modeling the systems? properties and responses to external stimuli (temperature, electric and magnetic fields) guides the experiments and accelerate the development of new materials and molecular devices for sensing, computing, communications and other applications.  Professor Garashchuk's research and educational activities will train the workforce ready for the emerging quantum information science.  She promote use of computational chemistry and computing in education and research among students and researchers at her home institution, as well as at sister campuses and predominantly undergraduate institutions throughout the state of South Carolina. The research team is engaged in K-12 science demonstrations to showcase molecules and their roles in everyday technologies. These activities broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research, develop of the next-generation technologies, and communicate contributions of STEM to the general public of South Carolina, a geographically underrepresented group in the global research enterprise.<br/><br/>Garashchuk develops theory and computational methods for the  hierarchical treatment of nuclei practical for large (10-1000 atoms) molecular systems. The hierarchy consists of exact (time-dependent bases) and approximate methods (classical dynamics, possibly, with quantum corrections) unified by the trajectory framework. The exact quantum dynamics employs Gaussian bases which adapt to the evolving nuclear wave function  by following the probability density flow, which follows the quantum trajectories. Such basis function evolution  defines  ?minimalistic? representation of a wavefunction in configuration space and improves the scaling properties of the method with the system size. The Gaussians are correlated and normalizable by construction.  The multilevel description of the nuclei, helps to exploit the time- and mass-scale separation for an efficient computational methodology, interfaced with on-the-fly electronic structure calculations. The Quantum Trajectory-guided Adaptable Gaussian (QTAG) dynamics is employed to study nuclear quantum effects in molecular aggregates, i. e. crystalline materials, active sites of enzyme catalytic cycle, functional molecules integrated into covalent and metal-organic frameworks, as a way to  tune and control their properties  relevant to the design of molecular sensors, switches, catalysts, and to the emerging quantum device and computer applications. Connecting research with education and workforce development, Garashchuk incorporates computational chemistry into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum, by providing cyber-research opportunities to regional undergraduate colleges, and by hands-on training of students at all levels in computational chemistry tools and methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Male rhinoceros beetles wield a giant, pitchfork-shaped horn on their head that they use in battles between rival males over feeding territories visited by females. Males with the longest horns win, in part because horn length accurately reflects body size and fighting ability of males - it is an honest signal of male quality. Prior work by the investigators revealed that winning fights is not enough, however. Even after battling to hold a territory, males must still spend hours each night ""singing"" to females using a novel file on their wing covers that they rub against a plate on their abdomen, and they produce blends of scents in their waxy outer cuticle that appear to communicate male body size and nutritional state. This study will explore the link between male condition and both song and scent signals, examine female preferences for these signals, and characterize the diversification of this suite of courtship signals across the range of the species. How do females discriminate among males, and why do they ignore the obvious signal of male quality (the horn)? The investigators will also work with the Gonzaga department of dance to design performances inspired by animal behavior, develop an interactive exhibit on insect songs for the Missoula Insectarium, and design interactive online curricula for K-16 students through the University of Denver to share information about beetles with the public.   <br/><br/>Prior work on the Japanese rhinoceros beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus, a heavily weaponed species characterized by a textbook resource defense mating system, led the investigators to suspect that these beetles show elements of lekking behavior. Females are reluctant to mate with resident males guarding feeding territories despite those males consistently being among the largest, longest-horned individuals in the population. Using a combination of laboratory manipulation experiments and field observation and perturbations, this study will rigorously characterize stridulatory song and cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile signals in rhinoceros beetles (Aim 1), and evaluate their importance to female mate choice (Aim 2) and male rival assessment during contests (Aim 3). In addition, this study will compare song dialects and CHC profiles across the range of this species (Aim 4), to contrast the relative rates of evolution of agonistic and mate-choice signals. Finally, they will perform a quantitative trait locus mapping study of adjacent, genetically similar but phenotypically divergent populations, combining the resulting linkage maps with a re-sequenced reference genome, and FST 'outlier' results from a prior PoolSeq study of the same populations, to delve into the genetic architecture of this suite of multimodal signal traits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since its discovery in 1959, space scientists have been studying the behavior of protons and electrons in the solar wind, their interaction with the magnetic fields pervading interstellar space, and with magnetospheres of planets. At approximately the same time, plasma physicists were thinking about containing plasma that is a hundred times hotter than that in the solar corona, to obtain controlled fusion reaction ? a virtually inexhaustible source of relatively clean and safe energy. They came up with the so-called mirror machine, a magnetic configuration resembling a bottle with two openings at the opposite ends. However, such a device was not ideal ? hot plasma could leak through the bottleneck openings and stream away from the confinement chamber.  This project establishes the analogy between the plasma escaping the mirror machine and the plasma expanding from the hot solar corona. It will use the theoretical framework developed in plasma fusion studies to explain the behavior of electrons in the solar wind, one of the fundamental problems of space plasma physics.    <br/> <br/>The project studies the solar wind plasma expanding from the hot solar corona. It addresses the following question: given the electron distribution function near the solar corona, what is the resulting distribution function at larger heliospheric distances? The project establishes the analogy with the plasma mirror machines. Similarly to the mirror-machine expander, the solar wind electron distribution function contains a beam of electrons streaming along the magnetic field lines and a quasi-isotropic core that, on one hand, is related to the electrons scattered from the beam and on the other, provides scattering for the streaming electrons. The project develops a new self-consistent theoretical framework for solving this problem. The outcome of the study will be the electron distribution as a function of radial distance. This will allow one to understand, in particular, the radial energy transfer and energy deposition in the background plasma, the plasma temperature profile in the expansion region, the electron instabilities and the resulting plasma turbulence. The results will be compared with available observations, and in particular, may be valuable for the interpretation of the Parker Solar Probe data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As cities grow and both the incidence and intensity of high-temperature events increases, the management of population heat exposure while minimizing disruption to day-to-day activities is becoming a growing challenge among urban planners and residents alike. High temperatures pose especially large potential risks for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and low-income families. This Smart and Connected Communities Planning Grant supports the creation of a collaborative working group of researchers in mobile systems, computational imaging and sensing, urban climate informatics, and economics alongside key stakeholders of community members, city officials, urban planners, and designers to investigate potential strategies to increase heat resiliency in urban populations. In collaboration with researchers and community members from Japan, this project will seek to identify, promulgate, and promote strategies for heat-risk reduction and resiliency - both within and across cultural contexts - while also investigating the importance of local cultural factors in the spread and adoption of such strategies at the individual and societal levels. This work will span both the United States and Japan, two populations whose cities suffer different issues related to heat exposure. This project will support travel, preliminary research studies, and workshop forums with community partners. The outcomes of this planning grant will include pilot studies and data collection for measuring physiological factors for heat effects, as well as a multiscale framework for linking physiological, behavioral/mental, and socioeconomical/cultural factors for heat resiliency across the United States and Japan. <br/><br/>This project aims to identify and assist stakeholders in tackling challenges facing at-risk populations in communities due to extreme heat. In particular, the project plans and builds capacity for future research aimed to study (1) physiological markers for heat stress and exposure, leveraging techniques from physics-based computational imaging and mobile health sensing, as well as (2) mental and behavioral models for individuals exposed to heat conditions, and how they interact with one another. Results will be used to develop user-centric thermal comfort models for individuals exposed to extreme heat conditions. This includes both physiological effects due to quantifiable environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, but also subjective assessment of an individual?s tolerance to heat based on clothing, activity level, past exposure history and experiences. A key focus of this project is to study these factors across communities in the United States and Japan. This includes planning and piloting preliminary data collection efforts for three cities: Amherst, Massachusetts; Phoenix, Arizona; and the greater Osaka region, Japan. Researchers with expertise in sensor development, heat sensing, mobile health, economics and behavioral modeling, and urban climate and infrastructure will collaborate to understand key research questions about the challenges and need for solutions in this application domain.

The conference is aimed at early-career mathematicians (especially graduate students) and is to be held September 7-12, 2020, at the Centro Internacional de Encuentros Matematicos (CIEM) in Castro Urdiales, Spain. The summer school is primarily for the purpose of training young researchers and encouraging their mastery of the subject area.  It will begin with three days of introductory lectures, followed by three days of more advanced lectures introducing the students to some current hot topics in the mathematical area of representation theory. The conference has three organizers and five speakers, representing a total of six countries. Hence, by allowing U.S.-based students to attend the summer school, this grant will stimulate important international collaboration and networking in the area.   Women and members of other groups underrepresented in mathematics are especially encouraged to participate, as building a network of peers early in one's research career has been shown to be especially crucial for staying active and visible in the field.<br/> <br/>The summer school will encourage cross-pollination between the two related (but sometimes seemingly distant) fields of character theory and module theory.  Many of the recent advances and open conjectures in the area of representation theory have made it clear that there is a strong benefit to combining the techniques from both sides.  The introductory lectures are designed for graduate students and postdocs with a good background in algebra but no prior knowledge in representation theory. They will cover the general theory from two different points of view: one focusing on the more numerical, character-theoretic point of view, and the other on the homological, module-theoretic point of view.  These courses will have a strong focus on arriving at some of the key definitions and concepts in block theory. The second part of the summer school will be aimed at showing the students some of the current directions of representation theory and how both perspectives play a role in some of the fundamental conjectures in the area.  Throughout the summer school, lectures will be alternated with discussion and problem sessions led by the speakers and organizers.  By providing students with an intensive introductory series of courses and lectures on current hot topics in the area, the summer school aims to motivate young researchers to use their talents to advance the state of knowledge in the area and to inspire a new generation of well-rounded representation theorists.

From preparing workers for STEM jobs, to growing opioid usage, to the impact of new modes of transportation, the challenges facing society are only growing. Yet local government and other community organizations lack access to research teams who can help inform solutions. This project aims to test a novel methodology called Research in Residence (RIR), whereby local and state government offices or agencies competitively select the most qualified research teams to help address critical community-identified needs. These teams, supported with short-term funding provided by the participating government, work collaboratively with their government partner to carry out initial research activities. The academic-government partners additionally define longer-term research objectives and questions, schedule of activities, cost, and develop a path to securing full-funding for the identified activities through local or other support. <br/><br/>Three primary barriers inhibit research with communities: 1) ineffective matching of community needs with academia; 2) unstructured engagement practices; and 3) complexity of supporting the research activities. Currently, there is no streamlined mechanism for government staff to locate researchers who can assist them and conversely for researchers to identify the right party within municipalities with whom to engage. If a match does occur, the lack of a structured engagement model reduces the likelihood of successful outcomes. These difficulties have led government entities to either rely on voluntary academic research or to push the burden of securing funding to universities. This project will utilize a new approach for linking researchers with communities, unlocking potential benefits to researchers who gain access to personnel and resources to address pressing community needs, communities who benefit from impactful research-based solutions, and funding entities who benefit from a set of well-developed, use-inspired research ideas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These geometric objects, similar to the objects we see around us, can possess edges and vertices (such as a square), but can be so much more complicated (for example, possessing a fractal structure). Problems of this nature arise in many engineering/designing problems (such as the designing of antenna reflector) in addition to many other areas out of mathematics (such as economics). Moreover, these problems are well connected with other areas of mathematics, including PDE and functional analysis. Another benefit of these problems is that in various special cases, they are visually understandable and solvable by motivated undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The recently posed dual Minkowski problem and Lp dual Minkowski problem are two Minkowski-type problems that received much attention. The principal investigator, through collaboration, has gained a good understanding of the solutions when one assumes origin-symmetry of the data and the convex body. There, the final solutions depend very much on convex bodies with non-smooth boundaries. An understanding in the non-symmetric case is imperative and is one of the goals. The challenge is to identify and solve the proper optimization problem. Another goal is to understand how an optimization problem involving two bodies can help in this setting. The same phenomenon can be observed when one considers the antenna reflector design problem with decay. The Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality is one of the deepest results in convex geometry and emcompasses many isoperimetric inequalities. The equality condition remains quite mysterious as even in the simple cases, bodies with fractal boundary structures can arise as extremal cases. The PI will study the characterization of the support set of mixed area measures which is essential in understanding the equality condition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When metal ions move though water, they push past the water molecules as they go. It is already known that hydrogen ions migrate in a completely different manner and faster. The researchers study in detail how this process works and what makes it many times faster than the diffusion of metal ions, for example what makes it faster than that of lithium ions in batteries. Several factors can enable very fast, hydrogen-ion batteries that have the potential to be charged and discharged for millions of cycles, and so present a remarkable opportunity to realize the Holy Grail of electrochemical energy storage: to achieve simultaneously the energy densities of batteries and the power and cycle life of capacitors. The abundance of hydrogen also makes hydrogen-ion batteries a promising candidate for the grid-level storage batteries that are needed to provide a continuous and dependable electricity supply from intermittent power sources such as wind and solar energy. Advancing knowledge and the associated technology in these areas aids the United States to remain economically competitive. Additionally, the project produces educational videos targeted to students and the broader public that present concepts in energy storage and its role in society. Training of graduate and undergraduate students with the skills needed to enter the workforce in the energy technology sector and additional outreach activities take place at both institutions.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The existing knowledge of battery chemistry is built upon the understanding that the kinetics are dictated by desolvation and vehicular diffusion of the working ion. The research in this collaborative project, which is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, explores a new paradigm of battery chemistry where by using protons as the working ions with an aqueous electrolyte, charge conduction does not rely on the long-range physical migration of ions through the host electrode but instead obtains long-range movement of charge via the Grotthuss mechanism of proton displacement along the crystal water network in an electrode. Transport of protons via the Grotthuss mechanism involves the movement of a quasiparticle defect in the bonding topology of water. It is fundamentally different from the vehicular transport of metal cations and could give rise to ultra-fast insertion kinetics and the ability to provide batteries that deliver high power at ultra-low temperatures. The project focuses on mechanisms of proton transport and storage in Turnbull blue and its family of analog compounds. These systems have an open and defected crystal structure that hosts an internal network of crystal water. The crystal water network provides pathways for Grotthuss diffusion, making the kinetics of proton transport and storage exceedingly fast, even at temperatures well below the freezing temperature of water. This project tests the central hypothesis that the transport performance of protons in this system depends on the topology imposed on the H-bonding network of crystal water by the surrounding host framework. To test this, the researchers a. determine the topological characteristics of the water network in Prussian blue analogs, from the atomic to the mesoscopic scale, and the role they play in Grotthuss topochemistry; b. elucidate the mechanisms of proton insertion, storage, and transport in the water network within Prussian blue analogs at all states of charge; and c. formulate testable design principles that can guide the development of new reticular materials for proton transport and storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The inequities are particularly profound for high school students of color and students from rural and low-income backgrounds. As a consequence, these students are less likely to succeed in STEM courses and pursue STEM majors and careers. When workforce-relevant STEM courses are available, underrepresented and underserved students are also more likely to be taught by teachers who are ill-prepared to teach such courses. This further exacerbates the problems and failures of inequity in the education system. This planning grant will begin to address these challenges through a large-scale social-change-driven coordinated effort. The American Institutes for Research (AIR), in collaboration with 100Kin10, will create this large-scale change by preparing for, launching, and supporting three place-based networks to improve the quality of and equitable access to workforce-relevant STEM courses. These networks will develop plans that, when implemented, will enable more underrepresented students to access and succeed in workforce-relevant STEM courses, as well as determine the extent to which the collaborative infrastructure and its use contribute to those systemic improvements. Each of the place-based networks, made up of districts, teacher preparation programs, business communities, and other relevant organizations in a geographic region, will test, adapt, and refine strategies for driving STEM improvements at the local level.  If successful, this foundational work will not only inform the approach for expanding and scaling the model, but it will also contribute to NSF?s commitment to improving quality and inclusion within the K?12 education system by focusing on broadening participation challenges at the high school level.<br/><br/>Over the 12-month project duration, the guiding framework for the work will be centered on two of the five NSF INCLUDES design elements of collaborative infrastructure; (a) leadership and communication and (b) expansion, sustainability and scale. Using this framework, the work will begin with a literature scan conducted by AIR to identify evidence-based practices and measures aligned to leadership, communication, expansion, sustainability, and scale in PK?12 education systems. AIR and 100Kin10 will then work collaboratively with the place-based networks to co-design plans that use evidence-based practices for collaboration among members and promote evidence-based strategies for reducing systemic STEM inequities to support the design and delivery of workforce-relevant high school STEM courses, especially in low-income, rural, and majority-minority high schools. Specifically, the co-designed plans will work to: (1) improve educators? capacity to develop and teach workforce-relevant STEM courses; (2) increase the number of high school students enrolling in and completing workforce-relevant STEM courses; and (3) expand, sustain, and scale evidence-based practices for supporting underrepresented student populations in STEM. The place-based network plans will include goals and metrics for tracking the progress in overcoming the inequities and determining the extent to which specific collaborative mechanisms spur progress toward the place-based networks? aim.  After identifying and selecting the goals and metrics, the project team will work with the place-based networks to understand the local, root causes of inequity in student access to workforce-relevant STEM; support the creation of strong local place-based networks; and draft plans with goals and metrics for progress in overcoming the inequities and collaborative mechanisms that may spur that progress. The support of these efforts will be led by the backbone organization, 100Kin10. The role of the backbone organization will be to support the launch the three place-based networks, support their partnerships through workshops and convenings, and connect them to its extensive national networks of representatives from more than 30 organizations nationwide with expertise in the central levers of systemic STEM change and focused on improving access to workforce-relevant STEM courses. <br/><br/>This planning grant is funded by NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion, and broadening participation in STEM at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The statistic shows that one COVID-19 patient consumes on average 17 face masks per day worn by the medical personnel. The pandemic is also affecting personnel in military and correction facilities. The post COVID-19 forecast describes that the face masks will be required long after the infection and death toll curve is flattened and declines. Wearing face masks will become a new norm for a long period of time at workplaces, shopping centers, and public events. Simultaneously, with the huge demand, face mask prices are increasing dramatically. This project is targeting the design and fabrication of a prototype of heatable and reusable face mask that can kill viruses caught on the mask surfaces thus preventing their penetration within the human respiratory system. This is achieved through resistive heating above the virus lethal temperature. A thin and breathable hater film made of  engineered carbon nanomaterials will be used, which is porous and can be retrofitted or placed on the outer surface of any commercial face mask. This heatable filter is powered by a portable  battery or a cell phone and is thermally insulated from facial skin. The mask can be energized when worn by the user or in storage to disinfect it. Faculties with diverse background as well as undergraduate and graduate students, and eventually some industries, will be involved in this project. <br/><br/>The main objective of the proposal is to fabricate and test a heatable and porous carbon nanotube air filter incorporated into a commercially available N95 respirator or other face masks that are suitable for healthcare workers dealing with pathogens. The Joule heating is generated by a thin film consisting of a few layers of carbon nanotube  sheet drawn from vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays, however other carbon nanotube sheet materials like Bucky paper can be also employed. The performance temperature directly on the surface of the porous carbon nanotube  heater is designed not to exceed 85 °C, which will be enough to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. The selected breathable insulating layers will attenuate this temperature down to the harmless 37 °C when wearing the heated mask. A second mode of the mask operation is proposed here when the protective equipment after use  is  activated by heating for 30 seconds which will disinfect the stored mask for reuse. The objective of this proposal will be achieved by pursuing the following aims: (a) design and fabricate a breathable carbon nanotube  heater that is flexible and requires low voltage for powering via a portable battery or cell phone; (b) integrate the porous carbon nanotube heater into commercial masks; (c) test the air flow rate and the effectiveness of the mask to inactivate virus surrogates, and its safety to be worn. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is seen in the merging of a porous carbon nanotube heater with a conventional face mask, thus converting it to a reusable Personal Protective Equipment, which is proposed here for the first time. This mask does not have an alternative among other commercial face protective equipment. The broader impact of this proposal can be found in the multipurpose use of the invented face mask, which is expected to be beneficial not only for healthcare providers, but also for military personnel exposed to biological weapons, as well as for the general public preventing viruses causing COVID-19.

They impact aspects of climate, help to sustain life, and influence societal needs such as drinking water, food security, and economics. In Panamá, a specific concern is the impact of rainfall on the functioning of the Panamá Canal. Rainfall and river discharge (Q) are strongly linked in Panamá, and they play a crucial role in the sustained success of the canal. Rainfall totals across Panamá consistently place it in the top five countries for annual rainfall, but when major droughts occur, the Panama Canal Authority places restrictions on ship traffic to conserve water so that the canal can continue to operate. Panamá has a well-known seasonal variability in precipitation, with a wet season that lasts from about May through November. However, little is known about rainfall variation on longer time scales, on the order of decades or centuries. In addition, it is not clear how El Niño events may influence Panamanian rainfall, though there are suggestions of a relationship between El Niño strength and drought severity. These questions are hard to address because instrumental data, particularly river discharge records, are short and often unreliable ? we need a longer-term perspective. The chemistry of coral skeletons can preserve records of climate conditions and climate variability; these chemical records are called climate proxies. This project will use coral climate proxies to reconstruct hydrologic variability along the Pacific Coast of Panamá over the past ~300 years at near-monthly resolution. The final product will be a multi-coral, multi-proxy record that can be used to identify the frequency and strength of events such as droughts or El Niño. This project includes support for 8 female undergraduates and 1 Ph.D. student. Results from this project will be incorporated into a teaching workshop for middle and high school educators and will also be shared with water resource managers in Panamá. <br/><br/>Many tropical nations are subjected to intense variation in precipitation with extreme seasonality. Meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is largely responsible for this variability, with northward movement during the boreal summer and a southward shift during the austral summer. In the Pacific, El Niño and other less well constrained decadal and century-scale modes of ocean- atmosphere variability also dictate regional climate. In Panamá, a country whose rainfall and river discharge (Q) are tightly coupled, understanding hydrologic variability is of the utmost importance when considering the potential impacts on the Panamá Canal, whose functioning relies solely on hydraulic head differences between the canal locks and the Gatun Lake reservoir. Therefore, the probability of anomalous hydrologic conditions, such as drought and flooding, must be well defined. However, the lack of long instrumental records of tropical hydrology (i.e.; rainfall and Q) limits our ability to develop a rigorous understanding of drought and flood recurrence intervals. These issues raise the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between El Niño Southern Oscillation and droughts and flooding in Panamá? 2) Can we identify droughts and flood years that are not related to El Niño? And 4) Has there been multi-decadal or long-term secular changes in Q in Panamá and what climatic processes are involved? Preliminary results indicate that barium/calcium (Ba/Ca) time-series data from a coral core collected in 1984 at Secas Island in the Gulf of Chiriquí (GoC) along the Pacific Coast of Panamá has a remarkably strong correlation with Q from two major nearby rivers. Given these encouraging results, we will be completing the Ba/Ca analyses of the Secas Island core back to 1707 CE and to analyze a new GoC coral core collected in 2018. The final near- monthly resolved composite Ba/Ca record of Q will extend from 2018 to 1707 CE. By pairing Ba/Ca and ?18O on the same 1mm samples we can separately evaluate salinity and sea surface temperature changes in the GoC over the last 311 years. These paleo-Q and salinity reconstructions will provide a comprehensive history of Panamanian hydroclimate that can be exploited to track protracted deviations from average conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rau, Adrian Burd<br/><br/>Particle settling is one of the major ways that material in surface waters reaches the deep ocean. Particulate matter in the open ocean consists primarily of organic material from plankton and other biological detritus, which can readily aggregate to form large flocs. A combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes transforms these flocs as they settle, redistributing material throughout the water column and potentially sequestering elements such as carbon in the deep ocean. The impact of these transformations is affected by the sinking speed of these flocs, with larger and denser particles settling faster than smaller, less-dense ones. One of the key questions facing oceanographers today is what controls particle settling speed (for example, particle size, shape, and density). There is considerable evidence that particles readily break apart as they settle, decreasing their average size and settling speed, but it is not yet understood what conditions cause these disaggregation events. This work will measure the breakup characteristics of organic settling particles both in the laboratory and at sea to quantify the importance of these breakup processes relative to particle transport. The work will be done at the Pennsylvania State University in collaboration with the University of Georgia to target the development of future marine particle disaggregation models for use by the oceanographic community.<br/><br/>This research will play an important role in determining the importance of disaggregation on the vertical transport of particulate matter in the ocean. The project will quantify the breakup of organic marine aggregates due to fluid forces caused by turbulence or swimming organisms. Phytoplankton will be cultured and formed into aggregates in the lab prior to disaggregation using calibrated turbulence. The size, shape, and structure of these aggregates before and after breakup will be quantified using high-speed visualization and holographic imaging. In addition to the laboratory measurements, a deployable instrument that can disrupt particles in-situ and measure their size and shape will be built and deployed in the North Atlantic during the spring bloom of phytoplankton. Detailed measurements of particle concentrations, breakup characteristics, organic content, and ambient turbulence as a function of depth in the water column will be collected. This work will represent the first study of marine aggregate breakup in-situ. Specifically, the project will clarify: (1) under what conditions disaggregation is important, (2) how strong different types of natural marine aggregates are and how their strength varies with size, composition, and morphology, and (3) how aggregate size, composition, and structure influences the distribution of its breakup mass. This project will advance the career of a doctoral student and engage numerous undergraduate researchers with the field of ocean science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the early Eocene (56 to 49 million years ago) was characterized by higher-than-modern atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and much warmer mean global temperatures. This period may be a good analog for the 21st or 22nd century. By that time, climate models predict that greenhouse gas emissions will produce warmer conditions than the Earth has experienced for at least 35 million years.  One common feature of all past periods of warm climate is the exceptional warmth of high latitude regions. However, current climate models fail to reproduce these warm polar temperatures. This disagreement between paleoclimate records and model simulations poses a major challenge in climate research. Are the paleoclimate data biased, are the climate models inaccurate, or both? Testing of climate models is currently limited by the scarcity of robust paleoclimate data. For instance, many records of past sea surface temperature are based on the isotopic and chemical composition of fossil shells of planktic foraminifera. These microorganisms live throughout the surface ocean and their shells are preserved in seafloor sediments. However, these fossil chemical records can be degraded by sedimentary processes acting over millions of years. High-resolution microscopic imaging now allows for the identification of better-preserved areas within fossil foraminifera shells. And recent analytical developments make it possible to measure the chemistry of these tiny areas.  The proposed study will use these new methods to re-assess equator-to-pole sea surface temperature gradients in the Pacific Ocean during the early Eocene warm period. These data will shed new light on the data-model mismatches and help improve the climate models? accuracy. The study will support a graduate student. The project results will be highlighted in a science outreach display to introduce paleoclimate studies to non-scientists.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Our ability to accurately simulate warm climates in Earth history provides one of the most important tests of our understanding of the Earth?s atmospheric system. Of particular interest is the early to middle Eocene 56 to 49 million years ago) which is the last time that greenhouse gas levels exceeded ~600 ppm CO2 (modern 412 ppm, increasing more than 2 ppm/year). A puzzling feature of this time is the exceptional warmth of high-latitude regions associated with relatively cool tropical temperatures and a weak latitudinal temperature gradient. However, even current climate models fail to simulate such a climate regime. This data-model mismatch may be partially caused by diagenetic alteration of paleoclimate archives. After millions of years in the sediment, diageneses may alter the original isotopic and chemical composition of foraminifer shells, sand-grain-sized marine microfossils that are ? by far ? the most important recorders of the Earth?s past climate. Within the past years, it was found that minute (just tens of microns) domains within these foraminifer shells are better preserved than the remaining material. Recent developments and improvements of in situ (?in place?) analytical approaches in combination with high-resolution imaging now allows for the identification and analysis of these better-preserved domains within foraminifer shells. By using these new and emerging in situ technologies, we aim to re-asses meridional temperature gradients through early Eocene climate maxima across a South Pacific longitudinal transect. Thereby, we will focus on three time intervals that are of highest interest for climate modeling community: (1) The Early Eocene Climate Optimum (~53 ? 51 Ma); (2) The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~56 Ma), (3); The period just before the PETM to assess to pre-warming background conditions. State-of-the-art imaging approaches to identify better preserved domains within foraminifer shells will be used in combination with Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) for oxygen isotope analysis, Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) for the determination of Magnesium/Calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios, and Laser-Ablation ICP-MS for multielement depth profiling through foraminifer chamber walls (chemical ?fingerprinting? of diagenesis). The in situ data will be paired with conventional oxygen isotope measurements to assess the potential bias of previously published paleorecords.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topological applications will include new insights into knot concordance, homology cobordism, diffeomorphism groups of 4-manifolds, and SU(2) representations of 3-manifold groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hunter (Alaska) ice core archive and evaluate North Pacific hydroclimate variability in context with existing paleoclimate data and models. This project is motivated in part by recent observational and modeling studies that demonstrate a connection between Pacific multidecadal variability and Arctic warming during the early 20th century and since the 1970s. The impact of Pacific multidecadal variability on Arctic climate has considerable implications for sea ice extent and possible linkages between Arctic amplification, sea ice loss, and enhanced mid-latitude winter variability. <br/><br/>Previous work on the Mt. Hunter ice core record demonstrates that the observed doubling of snow accumulation and 60-fold increase in summer melt during the industrial era (since the year 1850) is linked to Pacific multidecadal variability and is unique in the last millennium.  The research seeks to confirm if the same drivers are relevant for the entire Holocene. Establishing how the Pacific-Arctic teleconnection responded during warm intervals and abrupt events outside of the instrumental period and last millennium would provide valuable insight into Earth system sensitivity.<br/><br/>The researchers will combine several complementary techniques in different sections of the Mt. Hunter ice core archive, with specific focus on the bottom 20 meters of the twin 208-meter surface-to-bedrock cores. Preliminary radiogenic isotope (14-Carbon) analyses demonstrate that the basal ice is more than 10,000 years old.  <br/><br/>Specific project objectives include: 1) time scale development using additional 14-Carbon measurements, tephrochronology, laser ablation ICPMS measurements to extend annual layer counting, and a suite of glaciological models; 2) hydroclimate proxy development, including snow accumulation for regional moisture estimates (based on chronology and ice flow models), stable water isotopes for the integrated water cycle, and trace element chemistry for atmospheric dynamics; 3) integration with the new Holocene-length Mt. Hunter record with the existing North Pacific ice core array and other regional paleoclimate data; and 4) comparison of the new Holocene-length Mt. Hunter record with Earth system models.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a multi-faceted approach that includes support and mentoring of an early career scientist and a doctoral student in the context of international research cooperation.  The researchers will collaborate with Colorado State University faculty and U.S. National Park Service faculty personnel to fabricate educational kits based on the Mt. Hunter ice core record that target grades 4-12 education in Alaska and Maine schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advancement of the study on such materials in spintronics and magnetotransport has been hindered by conceptual and practical challenges associated with the lack of vector-like order parameters and non-conservation of conduction electrons? spin. This cohesive theoretical-computational project aims to address these challenges, through the following research thrusts:<br/><br/>(1) Computational search for new noncollinear magnets guided by symmetry. Group-theoretic methods and the Landau theory of phase transition will be used to search for new noncollinear magnets in materials science databases beyond the very few known examples. <br/><br/>(2) New response functions, functionalities, and experimental probes of noncollinear magnets. A hydrodynamic approach complemented by semiclassical wave-packet theory will be used to elucidate the unique conserved current in noncollinear magnets and its coupling to itinerant electrons. Quantum kinetic theory will be used to identify new response functions such as a counterpart of the giant magnetoresistance but without approximate spin conservation, and the magnetic spin Hall effect in terms of spin density polarization. A theory for using magnetic neutron scattering to detect local orbital magnetization will be formulated. <br/><br/>This project contributes to the search for new technological breakthroughs in systems with strong electron correlations.

Ferroelectrics are used to make circuit elements such capacitors, antennas and filters; piezoelectrics are used in sonar and ultrasound imaging technologies; pyroelectrics are used in infrared imaging devices among other applications. The vast majority of dielectric materials are inorganic oxides, many of which contain lead. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research the principle investigator and his group discover and develop new dielectric materials within the emerging family of hybrid layered perovskites, materials that are made up of alternating layers of positively charged organic cations and negatively charged, corner-connected metal-halide octahedra. Through an iterative program of synthesis and characterization the rules governing the complex crystal chemistry of these materials are studied. The new knowledge is then used to design new dielectric and magnetic materials that can serve as alternatives to the lead-based oxide dielectrics that are widely used today. In addition, authentic in-class research experiments are developed and implemented in general chemistry courses at Ohio State University that impact hundreds of students per year, introducing them to research and key materials chemistry concepts at an early stage of their college education. Finally, the graduate and undergraduate students supported by this project gain training that prepares them for successful careers in academia and industry. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research, can be divided into two thrust areas. The first thrust involves synthesis and characterization of layered double perovskites that contain a checkerboard pattern of 1+ and 3+ cations on the octahedral sites of the inorganic layers. When paired with the appropriate organic cations these materials are able to mimic the promising dielectric properties that have recently been seen in lead-based hybrid layered perovskites, while avoiding incorporation of toxic elements such as lead and cadmium.  Phase transitions are studied to understand the structure directing forces in these materials and reveal the mechanisms by which various distortion mechanisms couple to one another. The second thrust brings a similar approach to compounds that contain magnetic cations, like Cu2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+. The research leverages the interactions between organic and inorganic layers to amplify the electrical polarization seen in polar crystals and enhance the coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters. The overarching theme of the research program is to develop an understanding of the complex crystal chemistry of these hybrid materials and use that knowledge to design and develop new ferroelectrics, antiferroelectrics, piezoelectrics, multiferroics, ferroelectric semiconductors, and related classes of multifunctional dielectric materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, several fundamental limitations must be addressed: (1) deterministic models are inadequate to characterize the effect of uncertainty in various properties of the cardiovascular system; (2) cardiovascular models are computationally expensive and therefore a stochastic treatment of these models may be too computationally expensive; (3) predictive models are needed in complex decision workflows to directly answer questions of clinical relevance in justifiable, probabilistic terms. This project proposes key advances in three complementary areas that are essential to make this next generation of model-aided diagnostics a reality: (1) highly scalable computational methods able to efficiently handle multiple instances of cardiovascular models with uncertain parameters; (2) new Monte Carlo estimators that leverage computationally inexpensive low fidelity surrogates; (3) new inference systems based on variables organized in networks, accommodating non-linear hemodynamic models, expert opinion and data. Since cardiovascular disease is the leading causes of death worldwide, this project serves the national interest by advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare, as stated by NSF's mission. The proposed research at the interface of computational mathematics and physiology offers an ideal framework to educate a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels. Workshops and mini-symposia will also facilitate the exchange of ideas on stochastic cardiovascular modeling within the scientific community. <br/><br/>Computational models are increasingly being adopted to inform treatment in personalized medicine but innovation in model-based diagnostics is still hindered by three main problems: (1) deterministic simulations, i.e., simulations with certain outputs providing a false sense of confidence; (2) stochastic simulations are typically associated with a dramatic increase in computational cost; (3) current paradigms in uncertainty quantification (UQ) need generalization to provide coherent inference frameworks combining physics-based models, expert opinion, observational data and experiments. Thus, the main goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop the next generation of efficient computational tools to accelerate inference from models and data in computational hemodynamics as well as in a wide range of applications. This goal is achieved through the following objectives: (1) development of efficient ensemble solvers for hemodynamics running on modern CPU/GPU hybrid architectures; (2) research in generalized approximate control variate Monte Carlo estimators to drastically reduce the time required to solve direct and inverse problems in uncertainty analysis; (3) extend Bayesian Networks combining numerical models, expert opinion and data in a coherent inference framework. This research will provide the scientific basis to construct the first model-based inference framework including experimental evidence, expert opinion, and to develop systems directly applicable to the clinical decision making process. Two prototype systems will be finally developed, with a focus on applications to pediatric surgery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Edge computing environments pose new challenges, as devices are heterogeneous, widely distributed geographically, and physically closer to end users, such as mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. This project develops EdgeVPN, a software element that addresses a fundamental challenge of networking for edge computing applications: establishing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to logically interconnect edge devices, while preserving privacy and integrity of data as it flows through Internet links. More specifically, the EdgeVPN software developed in this project addresses technical challenges in creating virtual networks that self-organize into scalable, resilient systems that can significantly lower the barrier to entry to deploying a private communication fabric in support of existing and future edge applications. There are a wide range of applications that are poised to benefit from EdgeVPN; in particular, this project is motivated by use cases in ecological monitoring and forecasting for freshwater lakes and reservoirs, situational awareness and command-and-control in defense applications, and smart and connected cities. Because EdgeVPN is open-source and freely available to the public, the software will promote progress of science and benefit society at large by contributing to the set of tools available to researchers, developers and practitioners to catalyze innovation and future applications in edge computing.<br/><br/>Edge computing applications need to be deployed across multiple network providers, and harness low-latency, high-throughput processing of streams of data from large numbers of distributed IoT devices. Achieving this goal will demand not only advances in the underlying physical network, but also require a trustworthy communication fabric that is easy to use, and operates atop the existing Internet without requiring changes to the infrastructure. The EdgeVPN open-source software developed in this project is an  overlay virtual network that allows seamless private networking among groups of edge computing resources, as well as cloud resources. EdgeVPN is novel in how it integrates: 1) a flexible group management and messaging service to create and manage peer-to-peer VPN tunnels grouping devices distributed across the Internet, 2) a scalable structured overlay network topology supporting primitives for unicast, multicast and broadcast, 3) software-defined networking (SDN) as the control plane to support message routing through the peer-to-peer data path, and 4) network virtualization and integration with virtualized compute/storage endpoints with Docker containers to allow existing Internet applications to work unmodified. EdgeVPN self-organizes an overlay topology of tunnels that enables encrypted, authenticated communication among edge devices connected across disparate providers in the Internet, possibly subject to mobility and constraints imposed by firewalls and Network Address Translation, NATs. It builds upon standard SDN interfaces to implement packet manipulation primitives for virtualization supporting the ubiquitous Ethernet and IP-layer protocols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples of research that uses the Neotoma resource include understanding the causes and consequences of past extinction, assessing the sensitivity of species to large environmental changes that accompanied past ice ages, and measuring how quickly species adapt to past rapid environmental changes. Neotoma?s open data access will also facilitate new forms of education and outreach, by giving students and teachers direct access to research-quality data and empowering them to run their own analyses of past climate and biodiversity dynamics. This will help train the next generation of the scientific workforce, with crossover skills in both geological and data sciences.<br/><br/>Neotoma has become a research resource in paleoecology, paleoclimatology, macroecology, biogeography, and environmental archaeology, with rapid growth in data volume, kinds of data supported, and active third-party and externally-supported research projects.

Datasets must be carefully checked, taxon names harmonized, age-depth models updated, and uncertainties quantified. Neotoma will continue to address these challenges through a model of centralized infrastructure and distributed data governance. Priorities for this project are: 1) establishing international coverage for data types and research communities that now have critical masses of trained data stewards and data volumes in North America (pollen, diatoms, ostracods, testate amoebae, vertebrates), and 2) establishing critical masses of data and data stewards for recently added data types (specimen-level stable isotopes, organic biomarkers). Cyberinfrastructure improvements will include: 1) a web-based interface for bulk-uploading metadata and data from many sites, 2) better support for specimen-level isotopic measurements, 3) better visualization and analytical support for micropaleontological species-environment calibration datasets, and 4) a rebuild of Neotoma?s home webpage. Sustainability priorities include: 1) support for the recently launched non-profit EarthLife Consortium Foundation, and 2) a workshop in which leaders from Neotoma and other community data resources will receive training in building strategic sustainability plans, learn tools to manage finances and plan for the future, develop strategies to diversify their funding base, and enhance communication skills.

They include solid state light sources such as light emitting diodes and laser diodes, as well as modulators (that can encode an electrical or radiofrequency signal onto light) and detectors (which can convert light back into an electrical signal). Many modern optoelectronic devices rely on quantum confinement effects, and more in general on mesoscopic quantum structures which can be realized, for instance, by growing a sequence of thin layers of semiconductors (with thicknesses in the order of few nanometers). These structures possess new electrical and optical properties which the bulk semiconductors lack and are widely used for lasers (e.g. in quantum cascade lasers and quantum well laser diodes), modulators (e.g. in electro-absorption modulators) and detectors (such as in quantum dots and quantum well based detectors). New materials and technologies are very actively investigated by the scientific community to create faster, smaller and low-cost optoelectronic devices, and integration on silicon is often a must for telecommunications and imaging applications. 2D and van der Waals materials have attracted a lot of attention for optoelectronics, since they host new physical effects and can often be tuned electrically, by applying a voltage between the 2D material and a substrate via a gate oxide. However, the creation of large-scale quantum confinement in these materials is prohibitive since it is limited by the resolution of the lithographic and etching processes used to pattern either the 2D materials or the electrical gates.<br/><br/>So far, quantum engineering of 2D materials has been achieved mostly using heterostructures, including the realization of Moiré patterns. But these approaches have limits for large scale production and typically show weak effects. This EAGER research project aims to explore a new technique to create large scale quantum confined effects in 2D materials and to demonstrate devices based on this new technology. The approach is based on a new gate oxide fabrication technology. The gate consists of alternating layers of different oxides that are used to create a variable electrical potential on 2D materials when a voltage is applied on the gate. Unlike their bulk 3D counterparts, these quantum confined structures are widely tunable since the depth of the quantum wells is proportional to the applied gate. The PI plans to use these new effects to realize new types of modulators and photodetectors. Modulators can be realized by creating arrays of coupled two-dimensional quantum wells (also known as superlattices), which absorb light in different ways accordingly to the applied voltage. Both interband and intersubband absorptions in the 2D materials can be engineered using this new approach. Because these structures can be gated with highly conductive electrodes, the modulation speed is expected to be at least one order of magnitude greater than today?s modulators based on 2D materials. Furthermore, these devices will benefit from the possibility of quantum-engineering the excitons in 2D materials which appear at room temperature in the visible and near infrared ranges even when no quantum confinement is used. In addition to its obvious technological relevance, this project will advance understanding of 2D materials and associated quantum phenomena and offer opportunities for integrating this new knowledge in several courses on materials and devices at Harvard University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Activities of the network will have a two-way benefit: 1) D/HH researchers and students who are working on sign-related technologies are able to gain experience with new technologies and develop STEM skills they may not already possess; 2) Researchers with the technological capacity to develop cutting-edge sign-related technology benefit from expanding their networks to include those who are already experts in sign languages and the unique challenges they present: sign language users and D/HH researchers.  The CREST network increases the chances that sign-related technologies will be developed with D/HH input at all stages, meaning these technologies will be more likely to benefit people who use sign languages as a primary form of communication.  It allows for the growth of a community around a rapidly changing field which has the potential to reap great benefits for deaf individuals and communities of people who use sign language.  Two activities, contribution of videos and of blogs and posts, will deepen the connection between the CREST network and the NSF INCLUDES National Network that exists already, and the CREST network will bring new people to the National Network.  This work will benefit D/HH students, staff, and researchers who are part of the network, as well as the broader communities which may be affected by the technologies in development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A small fraction of the water on earth could be more accurately called HDO, where D stands for deuterium, the heavier hydrogen isotope in which the nucleus contains a neutron as well as a proton.  Likewise, some water molecules contain 18O, an isotope of oxygen which is heavier than ordinary oxygen by the addition of two neutrons.  These heavier forms of water share a subtle but important difference from ordinary H2O: they evaporate more sluggishly and condense more readily, preferring the solid and liquid phases to the vapor phase.  When water evaporates from the land or ocean surface the vapor is slightly depleted of the heavier isotopes, and each time rain falls from a cloud the water vapor remaining in the atmosphere is slightly lighter than the water that rained out.  <br/><br/>The removal of heavier isotopes by precipitation suggests that the abundances of heavier isotopes in water vapor and precipitated water contain important clues for understanding the hydrological cycle and its connections to environmental conditions. Results of research in this area are promising but they are complicated by the numerous factors that can influence isotopic composition.  Among these are the temperature at the location where the precipitation occurred, the height of the cloud that produced the precipitation, the relative humidity over the ocean where the water vapor evaporated, and the evaporation of lighter isotopes from raindrops as they fall through dry air.  Moreover, much of the research on water isotopes is based  on correlations between isotopic composition and variables relevant to physical mechanisms (temperature in the region of rainout, for instance).  These correlations can be quite informative but correlations by themselves cannot definitively establish causality.<br/><br/>Work under this award seeks to establish direct, causal relationships between the physical mechanisms relevant to isotopic composition and the actual composition of water vapor and precipitated water.  The research is conducted using a model, the Community Earth System Model (CESM), in which the mechanisms and their influence on isotopic composition are known exactly.  CESM is already equipped to simulate the physical processes that determine the ratio of heavier to lighter isotopes, and it also tracks the isotopic composition of water vapor as it circulates in the simulated atmosphere.  This project develops a new ""water tagging"" capability which allows simulated water vapor to record information about conditions under which it evaporated, for instance where and when it evaporated and whether it was processed through clouds.  This information is also transferred to the precipitation produced when water vapor condenses.  The tag information can be directly compared to isotopic composition, allowing the influence of the physical conditions and processes represented by the tags to be directly assessed. Some simulations use a data assimilation system (known as DART) to ensure that the simulated climate and circulation accurately represent their real-world counterparts.  Additional work uses a one-dimensional energy balance model, which provides a reduced-complexity setting to develop new ideas and test hypotheses.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the widespread use of water isotopes as a window on the functioning of climate and the hydrological cycle.  For instance isotope ratios in glacial ice cores have been used to estimate temperature differences between ice ages and interglacial warm periods, thus providing a valuable point of reference for understanding current climate change. The water tagging algorithms developed here will be made available to the worldwide user community of CESM, providing users with a powerful tool for the interpretation of isotope data and its application to a variety of research questions.<br/><br/>In addition, researchers supported under this award conduct educational outreach through a program focused on the Decker Lake Youth Center, a facility housing post-conviction youth in the Salt Lake Valley.

The brain consists of millions of neurons that are interconnected and form distinct circuits that transmit signals in coordinated manners. To analyze how neural circuit activity lead to behavior, neuroscientists rely on technologies to manipulate and track signal transmission of neurons in live animals. This project aims to develop strategies to form a novel interfacing device technology capable of chronically stable, optical, multi-regional, and bi-directional neural communication in behaving animals. Successful development of the flexible neural interfacing device would enable newfound understanding of the mechanism of human brain functions, as well as improved treatment protocols for neuropsychological diseases such as the Parkinson?s disease. Another aim of this project is to create a new course on bioelectronics that include intensive lab modules on layer-transfer processes for thin-film electronic devices, aimed at providing K-12 to graduate students opportunities to apply textbook theories to research laboratory settings or industry. <br/><br/>The state-of-the-art neurotechnologies rely on optical fibers or miniaturized microscopes to deliver light to and from the animal?s brain, which is engineered to produce proteins that make neurons interact with light at specific wavelengths. The two approaches, however, suffer problems such as poor resolution and inability to interact with neurons in deep brain regions, respectively, which limit their potential for brain-wide interfacing. This project aims to address these issues by developing a novel semiconductor-based optical brain-machine interface via the heterointegration of thin-film III-V optoelectronic devices in flexible geometries. Integration of freestanding, single-crystalline layers of micro-LEDs and photodetectors can yield a novel device platform capable of simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and functional recording in behaving mouse brains. The development of such technology requires wide range of skillset including the design, epitaxial growth, layer-transfer, and micro-fabrication of the neural probe, as well as in vivo demonstration including surgical implantation, input/output interconnection, optical stimulation and recording, and data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inhibitors that target these enzymes serve as potential therapeutic interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Drs. Mary Jo Ondrechen and Penny J. Beuning from Northeastern University to apply computational methods to identify sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins that would be good targets for binding inhibitors. The project uses artificial intelligence methods developed at Northeastern University to identify pockets and crevices in the structures of viral proteins that may serve as new targets for the development of antiviral agents. Large datasets of natural and synthetic compounds are computationally searched for molecules that fit into these alternative sites, and any compounds that fit will be experimentally tested for their ability to inhibit the functions of these viral enzymes. The project provides training in computational chemistry and biochemical analysis to graduate students and postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>This project uses the unique Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) machine learning (ML) method developed by Dr. Ondrechen?s group to predict multiple types of binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including catalytic sites, allosteric sites, and other interaction sites. The goals of this project are to apply the POOL-ML method to identify the binding sites on viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2 proteins using the three-dimensional protein structures as input. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to generate conformations for ensemble docking. Compounds from the large molecular databases are computationally docked into the predicted sites to identify potentially strong binding ligands. Candidate ligands to selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the main protease and 2?-O-ribose RNA methyltransferase, are experimentally tested in vitro for binding affinity and the effect of the best predicted inhibitors on catalytic activities determined by direct biochemical assays. All the SARS-CoV-2 protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are studied. Compound libraries for the study include: a) selected 2600+ compounds from the ZINC and Enamine databases that are already being manufactured; b) a library of 20,000+ compounds found in foods that the team recently gained access to; these potentially hold some special advantages, including ready availability in the public domain and low cost; and c) the March 2020 open access CAS (American Chemical Society) database of 50,000 compounds with known or potential anti-viral activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Effective and efficient disinfection of surfaces in public spaces will play an important role in plans to resume business, education, commerce, and other important activities.  Mass spray disinfection is currently used in multiple countries by employing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While this strategy has potential benefits, such as the minimization of health risk to personnel performing the disinfection and the potential for large-scale and quick deployments, the effectiveness of mass spray disinfection, especially for Covid-19, has not been systematically examined.  The goal of this RAPID project is to identify effective mass spray disinfection strategies for Covid-19, and employ UAVs to implement those strategies. The results of this project will provide effective means to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, as well as other infectious diseases (e.g., influenza), by intercepting virus transmission via fomites. The approach has the potential to be adopted as a general and scalable strategy for sanitization in hospitals, schools, and other public facilities that are susceptible to virus exposure and contact with a large number of people. To ensure the broader impact and accessibility of the research, all results will be available in open-source archives, as well as on social media dedicated to this project (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). The unique collaboration among the researchers provides an excellent opportunity for training and workforce development at the interface of multiphase flow physics, UAV engineering, and infectious diseases.<br/><br/>Fomites are objects or surfaces that can become contaminated with a pathogen. Studies have cited fomites as significant vectors for virus transmission in a range of environments including hospitals, schools, and offices. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to contaminate a wide range of porous and nonporous fomites, and can persist on many surfaces for extended periods of time from a few hours to days. The long persistence time indicates the need for effective surface disinfections to intercept virus transmission and the spread of the disease. Mass spray disinfection from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has many advantages including the high-tempo coverage of large and difficult-to-reach areas, and the minimization of health risks to personnel performing the disinfection. Nevertheless, the basic science that underlies the effectiveness of such mass spray strategies has not been examined. Instead, most prior work on surface disinfection is highly empirical. This project will develop a physicochemical understanding behind the empirical results. The project aims to address these gaps, and will determine the spray parameters and the underlying physics for effective disinfection under different conditions, and devise perception and decision-making algorithms that allow a UAV equipped with programmable sprayers to implement the spray strategies identified.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the shortcomings in the existing laboratory-based testing paradigm for viral diagnostics that features a widespread lack of test kits, extended time delays to obtain test results, and a high rate of false negative tests. The shortcomings of the existing laboratory-based infrastructure are contributing to uncertainty surrounding quarantine failure, confusion among health authorities, and also to a general public anxiety. To address this critical and timely need, in this work, development of point-of-care device is proposed for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal fluid samples and in 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The fundamental limitations of current assays for viral pathogens stem from their reliance upon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, which requires complex, labor-intensive, laboratory-based protocols for viral isolation, lysis, and removal of inhibiting materials. Importantly, PCR requires a large number of time-consuming and precise thermal cycles to enzymatically amplify specific RNA sequences. In this work development of an electrical, label-free and surface modification-free point-of-care device for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (1-3 copy/mL) from nasal fluid samples and in < 10 min. The proposed work will combine Bst polymerase in an isothermal RT-LAMP (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) reaction, with target-specific primers and crumpled graphene field-effect transistors (gFET) to electrically detect the amplification event by sensing the consumption of primers. These reactions offer the possibility of rapidly detecting SARS-CoV-2 using a simple, inexpensive and portable potentiostat and avoiding the necessity of RNA extraction. In order to develop the proposed detection technology, this proposal will first validate twelve sets of RT-LAMP primers specific to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, No RT-LAMP primers specific to SARS-CoV-2 are available commercially, neither in the literature. Then, the proposal will demonstrate the feasibility of the RT-LAMP-based electrical approach to detect SARS-CoV-2. Likewise, the proposal will demonstrate the approach as a global health technology to contribute to providing low-cost diagnostics around the world using portable and inexpensive heating block and potentiostat for virus detection and quantification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, there is a time-sensitive and critical need to find alternative means to keep medical professionals protected while caring for COVID-19 patients. Most PPE such as N95 respirators are designed for one-time use. For COVID-19, maintaining the supply of N95 respirators has become gravely challenging, as new supply has not matched the consumption rate. Moreover, disruption of global supply chains under lockdown also contributes to the shortage. There is an urgent need to develop effective technologies or toolboxes to help frontline healthcare workers have the PPE needed in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the research team will collaborate with clinical investigators in the Infectious Control Division at the New York Upstate Medical University and United Health Service (UHS), a community hospital treating COVID-19 patients, to develop ultraviolet (UVC) germicidal irradiation technology to disinfect and reuse N95 respirators. UVC irradiation has been investigated in the past to decontaminate N95 masks; however, its effectiveness on COVID-19 contaminated N95 masks is not well established. The overarching goal of this research is to fill this gap and generate new knowledge for effective disinfection and reuse of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>Sterilization technologies such as low heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide gas (VHPG), UVC germicidal, etc. are being tested by several groups of investigators for decontaminating N95 respirators. Unlike VHPG, UVC sterilization does not require sophisticated instrumentation. A UVC sterilization unit can be built easily with relatively simple materials. It is more suitable and operable in medium size and community hospitals where COVID-19 patients are not as numerous as in medical centers located in large cities. The proposing research team has developed a UVC bath station capable of disinfecting 960 N95 respirators a day, and 1,920 a day if two stations are used. However, currently key data are not available to validate the efficacy of these sterilizations. This study is designed to provide this data and to generate new knowledge in order to improve efficiency of UV germicidal irradiation. It is also unclear whether ozone generated during UVC irradiation improves disinfection. A fundamental study will be performed to elucidate the impact of ozone on UVC sterilization. Furthermore, the research team will explore high wavelength UVC for disinfecting coronavirus-contaminated N95 respirators. The use of high wavelength UVC irradiation should reduce chemical degradation of the polymers of N95 respirators, extending their lifetime. This study is targeted to provide comprehensive data and analyses on UVC N95 mask disinfection. This data is essential for an unbiased assessment of the decontamination technique, and will provide insight into the extent to which coronaviruses can withstand UV irradiation. Studies on ozone and high wavelength UVC irradiation will provide new knowledge for designing a better UVC N95 mask sterilization system. It is anticipated that the results of the research will help guide future governmental decision making about how to manage and adapt to PPE shortages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Various pandemic models are currently being used to predict the spread of a virus and establish which mitigation strategies are the most effective. These models are heavily based on assumptions and may include an oversimplified reality of how populations react and behave. This research will provide needed knowledge and methods for the development of a model of how individuals in the U.S. react to certain mitigation strategies, such as social-distancing, stay-at-home orders, quarantines, and travel advisories, by mining and analyzing social media data during the COVID-19 crisis. This enhanced modeling approach and its resultant model will be of great value to disaster response managers and policy/decision makers to understand human social behavior.

Structural biology methods help in understanding fundamental principles at the base of how biomolecules work by enabling visualization of those molecules at a high level of detail. Since SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a pathogenic threat in late 2019, structural biology methods have already been critical in providing details about how the virus enters human cells and how viral proteins interact with human proteins. One difficult step in achieving these structural maps is locating experimental conditions that allow the protein samples to be studied, and this project is geared toward addressing that bottleneck. The Crystallization Center provides state-of-the-art robotic equipment and specialized imaging to structural biology researchers worldwide who are studying protein structures. This project will provide immediate access to these resources and enable enhanced services to be developed for researchers working directly with SARS-CoV-2 related samples. This project will also develop new experimental pipelines to accelerate response time in the face of the current and future pandemics. The number of viruses that impact human society continues to rise, as evidenced by recent outbreaks of SARS, MERS, Ebola and Zika virus, among others. Viruses have the potential to damage national health and prosperity, and efforts such as this research therefore have potential to contribute to solutions to these global problems. <br/><br/>Since the appearance of the novel pathogen SARS-CoV-2, over 100 structures of viral proteins have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank, including 92 recent depositions of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with different ligands (as of April 15, 2020).  Close to 95% of the structures deposited thus far are derived from macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX) experiments. One of the major bottlenecks in MX experiments is determining the conditions in which a protein will crystallize, and this hinders the rapid response needed in the current pandemic. The Crystallization Center is a high-throughput crystallization facility that facilitates rapid, efficient crystallization of biomolecular targets and is the only resource in the world available to external users that makes high-throughput crystallization screening accessible with 1,536 conditions in one experimental plate and provides state-of-the-art imaging methods capable of detecting protein crystals very rapidly. These resources are being made available to researchers working with SARS-CoV-2 samples. Additionally, crystallization pipelines are being expanded with 1) increased state-of-the-art imaging in the experimental pipeline, 2) optimization and scale-up experiments at the facility, and 3) expedited crystal sample harvesting and shipping. This project will have a profound impact on the scientific community?s ability to quickly solve SARS-CoV-2 protein structures, facilitating a better understanding of the basic science underlying coronavirus biology.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the need for social distancing, the ability to continue essential business functions through effective remote work arrangements is a key means for addressing the global health crisis. However, many organizations are unprepared to accommodate a remote workforce and likewise lack insight into best practices as to how to promote continued productivity and well-being of the workforce in such arrangements. Although there is a large body of extant research on remote work arrangements, numerous questions remained under investigated. This project will address these gaps by studying the impact of several organizational, individual, technological, and supervisor characteristics on remote worker adjustment, well-being, and productivity. Findings from the project will provide evidence-based best practices that many large and small businesses can use both during future pandemics and other extreme events, but also going forward in normal work environments that may increasingly want to support remote work.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly promoted the need for remote work arrangements on a vast scale, but we lack key information regarding what makes such work productive and sustainable. This project will obtain data from 500 full-time employees who are working remotely during the response to COVID-19 but were not doing so previously. The first phase of the project will collect a baseline survey that captures characteristics and experiences prior to the pandemic and remote work transition and general perceptions of the adjustment to remote work process. Phase 2 involves a 30-day experience sampling study administered daily at the end of each workday that will capture day-to-day experiences, attitudes, and performance of remote workers. Benefits of this panel design are: 1) provides insights into how multiple dynamic changes influence outcomes; 2) enhances ecological validity; 3) allows researchers to examine both within- and between-person processes; and 4) reduces retrospective recall biases. The project will partner with several work organizations to collect the data. Data from Phase 1 will be analyzed using regression and dominance analysis; data from Phase 2 will be analyzed using multi-level modeling which controls for nested structures, adjusting standard errors to take into account the lack of independence. These analyses also control for between-subject variables and previous measurements while also accounting for missing data. Findings from the project will inform organizational theories involving the effects of organizations, individuals, work, and technology on workers and work outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award to Lincoln University, Missouri, has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of this project is to study the relationship between dust properties and the interstellar environments.  The project is a collaborative effort with faculty at the University of Missouri-Columbia, involves undergraduate students in the research, and is developing three undergraduate astronomy courses.<br/><br/>While it is well recognized that both the Galactic interstellar extinction curves and the gas-phase abundances of carbon, oxygen, and other metal elements exhibit considerable variations from one sightline to another, as yet, most of the dust extinction modeling efforts have been directed to the Galactic average extinction curve which is obtained by averaging over many clouds of different gas and dust properties. Therefore, any details concerning the relationship between the dust properties and the interstellar environments are lost. By utilizing the wealth of extinction and abundance data obtained by the International Ultraviolet Explorer, Hubble Space Telescope, and the Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, this project explores the dust properties of over one hundred individual sight lines by simultaneously both fitting the observed extinction curve from the near-infrared to the far-ultraviolet and conforming to the observed abundance constraints. Thus insight into the physical nature of interstellar grains and how they are related to the physical and chemical conditions of their environments will be gained. The results of the research will greatly benefit the analysis and understanding of the previously acquired data from various space missions, as well as of future data obtained.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microfluidic devices with tiny channels of varying widths are used to process mixtures of deformable particles and fluids and to manipulate DNA molecules. However, microfluidic devices frequently clog near constrictions, which is expensive since the device must be replaced when this occurs. Clogging has been studied extensively for rigid particles, like grains flowing out of a silo, but clogging of deformable particles is less well understood. In particular, it is unclear how particle deformability and stickiness or cohesion affects clogging. For example, will deformable and cohesive particles change shape and flow past each other at constrictions, or will they form arches and clog the system? This project combines experiments of emulsion droplets flowed through microfluidic devices with novel computer simulations of deformable particles to understand how they clog. This work will aid in future designs of critical microfluidic devices involved in industrial processing, filtration, and analysis of biological samples of cell-fluid mixtures. <br/><br/>Flow-induced jamming, or clogging, is observed across a wide range of systems, from flows of granular materials in silos to flows of blood cells through veins. Clogging is well studied in the case of hard, frictional grains, but is poorly understood when particles are deformable and cohesive. This project employs experiments of suspensions of emulsion droplets with tunable deformability and adhesion flowed through microfluidic devices, along with novel simulations of flows of explicitly deformable particles designed to model emulsion droplets. The combined experimental-computational approach can disentangle the effects of deformability, particle mechanical response, and adhesion on clogging probability. One key focus is the role of particle rearrangements during clogs in unjamming the suspensions. During clogs of granular materials, particles are static and clogs have long lifetimes. However, if particles are deformable, particle shape relaxation and stress redistribution in a clogged suspension can lead to intermittent clog release and avalanching. Additionally, this project will investigate how the Beverloo Law, which describes how flow rate changes with constriction width, changes in the case of deformable and adhesive particles. The combination of computational and experimental studies will aid the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict when a clog will form given the particle properties, flow rate, and constriction width. With the increased use of microfluidic devices to analyze suspensions of colloidal particles and cells, a predictive framework for clogging based on single-particle properties like deformability, elasticity and adhesion is required to design the next generation of efficient high-throughput microfluidic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on students in a project-based first-year  engineering design course.  Although it is effective in slowing viral infections, the sudden change to online instruction will also have a significant impact on undergraduate student experiences and learning.  Successful online courses typically are developed over months or years, with substantial support from instructional designers or other specialists at the institution.  In this case, the development of online courses had to be accomplished within weeks, and institutions did not have the capacity to scale assistance to all faculty as they converted their in-person courses to online courses.  Courses that include hands-on experiences, such as design courses, are a particularly thorny challenge to effectively deliver online.  <br/><br/><br/>High-quality instruction is critical in first-year courses, where students begin to form their identities as engineers and develop confidence in their engineering abilities.  Understanding the effects that the rapid shift to online courses has on student experiences in project-based engineering courses could fundamentally change the way administrators, educators, and industry prepare for and adapt to the unique needs of first-year students.  The findings of this work will provide insights that can guide informed decisions about the future of engineering education.  Three research questions will guide the investigations:  1. How do the self-efficacy beliefs and identity of students evolve during this transitional period?  2. How do the self-efficacy beliefs and the experiences of instructors evolve during this transitional period? 3. Are the results of the first two questions conditioned upon individual differences or the use of mediating technologies?  To answer these questions, the project will use a mixed methods approach that features qualitative interviews, surveys, data mining from learning management systems, and natural language processing.  The research plan will be broken into two phases: 1) in-situ data collection and analysis; and 2) analysis of the collected data.  The analysis will enable the research team to explore the implications of this sudden shift on future course offerings, instructor behaviors and beliefs, and student persistence, particularly the retention of first-year engineering students from underrepresented groups.  It can also provide insights about how to improve online versions of laboratory, design, and other courses that require students to do hands-on work.

By the year 2050, up to 10 million lives per year could be at risk. New strategies will be needed to counter this threat. Vaccines have been developed to safely and effectively prevent dangerous bacterial infections. This project seeks to address current limitations in vaccine production. Cell-free technology for vaccine production that can be easily scaled up will be developed. This could lead to portable, on-demand vaccine development and production. The project will advance the biomanufacturing of conjugate vaccines. This would improve their availability to resource-poor communities. In parallel, hands-on learning modules will be developed and delivered to underrepresented high school students, and to  undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The bacterial cell surface is decorated with complex sugar structures. These include capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and O-polysaccharides (O-PS). These structures are important virulence factors, adhesion mediators, and immunomodulators. CPS and O-PS structures are typically absent from the surfaces of host cells. These polysaccharides can, therefore, be formulated as vaccine subunits and used to protect humans against life-threatening bacterial infections. Conjugate vaccines are a type of subunit vaccine whereby polysaccharide antigens are linked to a protein carrier. They are among the safest and most effective methods for inducing immunity against pathogenic bacteria. Current production technology is technically complex and relies on living cells. Refrigeration is necessary at every step along the distribution chain. As a result, manufacturing is centralized, capital intensive, and requires highly skilled labor. This project will create a scalable, cell-free biosynthesis technology for generating conjugate vaccine candidates. Experimental and computational approaches will be combined to develop and optimize a one-pot cell-free glycoprotein synthesis system. These glycoconjugates can be stored in freeze-dried formats and reconstituted simply by adding water. A complementary technology, shotgun scanning glycomutagenesis, will enable comprehensive evaluation of glycosylation efficiency as a function of conjugation site and antigen loading density, which will be correlated with vaccine immunogenicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in mechanical properties are often hallmarks of disease and are critical for healthy repair following injury. However, how the cells sense these properties at different length scales and how that information affects cell function are not well-understood. This CAREER research investigates new polymers that are compatible with human cells and can be used to surround cells for laboratory culture in three-dimensional (3D) gels. The polymers are liquid crystalline (LC), which means that they can be designed to order at different length scales. The research will establish new gel materials and determine how protein orders within the gels. The work will then determine how the length scales at which cells sense mechanical properties affect cell function, as well as investigate materials-based approaches to tune protein deposition/organization and cellular activation. The knowledge of cell behavior gained from this CAREER project can help discover and validate therapies for diseases such as fibrosis, a pathology characterized by excess scarring, and can contribute to new materials for regenerative medicine. The educational goal of this project is to provide fifth and sixth grade students, who are vulnerable along gendered lines to decreased self-efficacy in STEM, with opportunities to practice resilience or ""grit"", a measurable and trainable skill. Research-based activities will allow these students to attempt challenges and confront and overcome failure in a safe environment with support from undergraduate mentors. The integrated educational and research program aims to 1) teach resiliency skills to underserved students to increase attitudes of STEM self-efficacy, 2) train undergraduate and graduate students in research and to communicate research to diverse audiences, and 3) broadly distribute results of that research and generate interest in STEM. <br/><br/>Part 2: Technical Summary<br/><br/>Analysis of cell cultures in vitro generates knowledge of cell behavior and can reveal therapeutic targets, validate clinical therapies, and establish new materials for regenerative medicine. Mammalian cells alter function in response to culture substrates with different elastic and viscous (viscoelastic) properties, yet how cells sense viscoelasticity is not well understood. Given the heterogeneity of natural tissues, clarifying at what length scales (from microns to millimeters) cells sense and/or respond to viscoelasticity is hypothesized to be a critical design variable unaccounted for in current culture substrates. This project will establish a new class of cytocompatible, three-dimensional (3D) liquid crystalline (LC) gels, to enable encapsulation of cells in vitro and to pioneer new insight into cellular/subcellular responses to local 3D environments. The first objective will synthesize LC hydrogels and establish design parameters that control LC polymer order and material properties. The hydrogels will be combined with Type I collagen and fibroblasts to determine how LC polymer ordering affects the organization of reconstituted and de novo synthesized collagen. The second objective will quantify fibroblast activation and protein responses to changes in the viscoelasticity of the local 3D environment at varying length scales. The educational goal centers on resilience or ""grit"" as a measurable, trainable skill key to self-efficacy in STEM. A novel service learning model will integrate research with education, focusing on underrepresented students at the late elementary and early middle school level, a time when gender differences in STEM self-efficacy arise and affect both the rate at which students enter and continue with STEM studies. Research-integrated activities will allow 5th and 6th grade students to attempt challenges and confront and overcome failure in a safe environment with support from undergraduate student mentors. The integrated and sustainable educational and research program is expected to 1) teach resiliency skills to underserved students, 2) train undergraduate and graduate students in research and to communicate research to diverse audiences, and 3) broadly disseminate results and generate interest in STEM research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the need for social distancing, the ability to continue essential business functions through effective remote work arrangements is a key means for addressing the global health crisis. However, many organizations are unprepared to accommodate a remote workforce and likewise lack insight into best practices as to how to promote continued productivity and well-being of the workforce in such arrangements. Although there is a large body of extant research on remote work arrangements, numerous questions remained under investigated. This project will address these gaps by studying the impact of several organizational, individual, technological, and supervisor characteristics on remote worker adjustment, well-being, and productivity. Findings from the project will provide evidence-based best practices that many large and small businesses can use both during future pandemics and other extreme events, but also going forward in normal work environments that may increasingly want to support remote work.<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly promoted the need for remote work arrangements on a vast scale, but we lack key information regarding what makes such work productive and sustainable. This project will obtain data from 500 full-time employees who are working remotely during the response to COVID-19 but were not doing so previously. The first phase of the project will collect a baseline survey that captures characteristics and experiences prior to the pandemic and remote work transition and general perceptions of the adjustment to remote work process. Phase 2 involves a 30-day experience sampling study administered daily at the end of each workday that will capture day-to-day experiences, attitudes, and performance of remote workers. Benefits of this panel design are: 1) provides insights into how multiple dynamic changes influence outcomes; 2) enhances ecological validity; 3) allows researchers to examine both within- and between-person processes; and 4) reduces retrospective recall biases. The project will partner with several work organizations to collect the data. Data from Phase 1 will be analyzed using regression and dominance analysis; data from Phase 2 will be analyzed using multi-level modeling which controls for nested structures, adjusting standard errors to take into account the lack of independence. These analyses also control for between-subject variables and previous measurements while also accounting for missing data. Findings from the project will inform organizational theories involving the effects of organizations, individuals, work, and technology on workers and work outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Populations of bees and other pollinators are in decline worldwide, which has major implications for ecosystem health and agricultural production interests. Colony collapse disorder, involving colonies of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is just one dramatic example of rapid loss of pollinators. Although a large number of viruses infect bees, it is not known how these viruses impact bee decline. A bee cell line would benefit science because it would allow scientists to identify how bee viruses infect and kill bees. The goal of this research is to establish and characterize the first immortalized cell lines from Apis mellifera. The resulting immortalized cell line(s) will provide an invaluable resources for the virology research field. In addition to helping the honey bee scientific community, this research may help understand disease dynamics in other pollinator species, many of which are important for US agriculture. This cell line may be the basis for commercially-available testing kits to identify or track bee diseases. The research uses funding to train graduate and undergraduate students, including under-represented students. As such this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science. Researchers will share their findings to the public through the use of beekeeping workshops, and honey bee health and research awareness activities through farmer?s markets and video documentaries. <br/><br/>The lack of immortalized bee cell lines has greatly hampered research on bee viruses. Thus far, only primary cell cultures have been established from Apis mellifera, the European honey bee. These primary cell cultures are difficult to establish and maintain, and suffer from several major drawbacks including the presence of multiple resident viruses, extremely slow cell division rates, and limitations on the number of passages before reaching senescence. This research will examine the ability of candidate honey bee genes to immortalize A. mellifera embryonic cells. This will be accomplished by stably expressing candidate genes in primary embryonic cells isolated from embryos and monitoring growth and survival of the resulting cells. Primary cells isolated from different developmental stages of the embryo will be used, in order to attempt to obtain immortalized cell lines that represent various cell types. Cell clones with optimum growth characteristics that are able to be stably passaged will be selected. The resulting immortalized cell lines will be screened for resident viruses by deep sequencing, and any viruses present will be cleared by using a combination of RNA interference and single cell cloning. The resulting virus-free, immortalized honey bee cell lines will be made available to the research community. If successful, this approach will also provide a template for researchers to isolate immortalized cell lines from other bee species.

One of the methods to detect COVID-19 infection, track the treatment effectiveness, and validate successful vaccination, is to measure the antibodies developed in human bodies. Unfortunately, current antibody detection relies on either complicated instruments in a centralized lab which is expensive and takes a long time to get the results, or a paper-based test strip, which, while quick (5-20 minutes), produces only Yes/No results, making this method very easy to generate false positives/negative and impossible to track the patients? response to infection, treatment, and vaccination. Therefore, a portable device that can rapidly, sensitively, and accurately measure multiple COVID-19 related antibodies is urgently needed to diagnose early infection and monitoring patients? response. The device in the project is based on a portable microfluidic system to rapidly, accurately, and sensitively measure the antibodies in blood at point-of-care, which allows for the detection of COVID-19 infection and tracking of antibody development in human bodies.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to combine microfluidic laser technology and microfluidic ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) technology to develop rapid and highly sensitive sensor array for multiplexed detection of COVID-19 related IgG and IgM using fingertip blood. There are three tasks: (1) to develop a microfluidic chip to extract serum from whole blood; (2) to integrate the laser sensing technology with traditional fluorescence ELISA to sensitively detect antibodies (IgG and IgM) with a large dynamic range; (3) to test with artificially spiked samples. The device provides the following advantages. (1) Quick turn-around time. It is highly portable and can be used to rapidly screen patients on-site, rather than sending samples to centralized labs. (2) Highly quantitative. This is critical to significantly reducing the false positives/negatives and monitoring the patients? infection trajectories and response to treatment and vaccination. (3) Highly sensitive and large dynamic range. Combined with the lasing technology, we expect to improve the antibody detection limit 10X with 10X larger dynamic range. Higher sensitivity enables earlier diagnosis of infection, preventing wide disease spread from those asymptomatic patients. A large dynamic range enables to easily track patients? antibody evolution over time. (4) Highly versatile. The device can be adapted to rapidly detect cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is one of the death causes in COVID-19 patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to  the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) noted that the increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria outside of medical settings was a cause for significant concern. One strategy for combatting viral and bacterial infections is the implementation of disinfection measures. Among the different chemical, thermal, and irradiation methods, disinfection based on exposure to ultraviolet (UV-C) light has gained favor due to its efficacy against a broad range of microbial and viral agents in a variety of environments. However, UV-C systems come in two categories: expensive and weak hand-held systems designed for small area applications or large commercial systems for medical settings. Both systems are currently challenging to procure. This research effort will design, fabricate, and validate a UV-C system in collaboration with USC Keck Hospital in Los Angeles that can be home built from easy-to-procure components. The research findings will be disseminated through online postings of the designs, podcasts, and an established online conference, as well as through peer-reviewed journals. PhD students and undergraduate researchers will be involved in the collaborative research effort.<br/><br/>The UV-C wavelength band covers 100nm-280nm, and it directly overlaps with the peak absorption of DNA and RNA (~260nm). Upon UV-C absorption, the pyrimidines in the RNA or DNA are converted to pyrimidine (6?4) pyrimidone photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. If the population of dimers is sufficiently high, transcription errors occur, ultimately resulting in inactivation of the bacteria or virus. UV-C is recognized as a universal disinfection method for bacteria, and its effectiveness in viral disinfection is not correlated with virus size, but with pyrimidine concentration. Thus, given the universality of UV-C as a disinfection method, designing and validating a system that can be constructed from easy-to-procure components has significant societal impact. The present work plans to leverage the recent rise of open-source electronics and commercially available components to design and build a portable UV-C disinfection system. Two different sources of UV-C will be explored as well as several different enclosure designs and control systems. This work includes both theoretical and experimental efforts. The final system will be validated using both bacterial and viral agents to ensure that the system meets the needs of the medical community and broader society. Given the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as the increase of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the community, designs for easy to build disinfection systems will have significant impact globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rechargeable batteries represent a critical component of the growing energy storage field, focused on renewable and green energy sources. In relation to sustainability issues, this project seeks strategies for the efficient replacement of expensive metals such as platinum with abundant elements such as sodium, magnesium, and iron. Battery safety issues are also under consideration. The project lays the ground work for new technologies that can be adopted for the fabrication of advanced rechargeable battery materials. In support of the broader impacts of the project, Dr. Dikarev is actively engaged in a program of national interest to create a database of new designer drugs that can be utilized by forensic investigation laboratories across the country for the identification of illicit substances.<br/><br/>This research develops new synthetic approaches for the predictable design of heterotrimetallic compounds whose molecular structures and ratios make them good precursors for the low temperature preparation of targeted materials. Specifically, precursors are prepared and  explored for the synthesis of prospective cathode materials that are difficult or impossible to obtain by conventional high-temperature techniques. The targeted materials are the oxide, fluoride, silicate, and phosphate cathode materials of rechargeable batteries. These contain specific A/M/M' (A = lithium, sodium, magnesium; M, M' = 3d transition metal) combinations, which are duplicated in the heterotrimetallic precursors. With the broad choice of targets the extent to which the molecular precursor technique can be utilized in complex materials synthesis is explored. The major practical outcome of this research is to demonstrate if single-source precursors can facilitate the preparation of multimetallic materials with high purity, exact stoichiometry, low preparation temperature, nanosized particle morphology, clean surface, and, especially, highly homogeneous metal distribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microfluidic devices with tiny channels of varying widths are used to process mixtures of deformable particles and fluids and to manipulate DNA molecules. However, microfluidic devices frequently clog near constrictions, which is expensive since the device must be replaced when this occurs. Clogging has been studied extensively for rigid particles, like grains flowing out of a silo, but clogging of deformable particles is less well understood. In particular, it is unclear how particle deformability and stickiness or cohesion affects clogging. For example, will deformable and cohesive particles change shape and flow past each other at constrictions, or will they form arches and clog the system? This project combines experiments of emulsion droplets flowed through microfluidic devices with novel computer simulations of deformable particles to understand how they clog. This work will aid in future designs of critical microfluidic devices involved in industrial processing, filtration, and analysis of biological samples of cell-fluid mixtures.<br/><br/>Flow-induced jamming, or clogging, is observed across a wide range of systems, from flows of granular materials in silos to flows of blood cells through veins. Clogging is well studied in the case of hard, frictional grains, but is poorly understood when particles are deformable and cohesive. This project employs experiments of suspensions of emulsion droplets with tunable deformability and adhesion flowed through microfluidic devices, along with novel simulations of flows of explicitly deformable particles designed to model emulsion droplets. The combined experimental-computational approach can disentangle the effects of deformability, particle mechanical response, and adhesion on clogging probability. One key focus is the role of particle rearrangements during clogs in unjamming the suspensions. During clogs of granular materials, particles are static and clogs have long lifetimes. However, if particles are deformable, particle shape relaxation and stress redistribution in a clogged suspension can lead to intermittent clog release and avalanching. Additionally, this project will investigate how the Beverloo Law, which describes how flow rate changes with constriction width, changes in the case of deformable and adhesive particles. The combination of computational and experimental studies will aid the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict when a clog will form given the particle properties, flow rate, and constriction width. With the increased use of microfluidic devices to analyze suspensions of colloidal particles and cells, a predictive framework for clogging based on single-particle properties like deformability, elasticity and adhesion is required to design the next generation of efficient high-throughput microfluidic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this proposal is to fill this gap by developing efficient aerodynamic models that capture the main physics of the flow dynamics. Relying on a unique combination of the fundamental knowledge of basic unsteady aerodynamics and the recent advances in data science (for example, machine learning techniques), this project will yield more realistic computations of the aerodynamic loads. The developed theory will be indispensable for preliminary design of next generation flying vehicles (flying taxis, micro-air-vehicles, and drones) and wind turbines, which will improve national security and economic prosperity. The project will include the development of a graduate course on unsteady aerodynamics based on this research, plans are underway to develop a textbook on the subject, and undergraduate students will be involved byway of aerodynamic-related senior projects.<br/><br/>Realizing that the lift generation and vorticity production are essentially viscous processes, a viscous extension of the classical theory of unsteady aerodynamics is proposed. This extension will be achieved by coupling the potential theory with a special boundary layer theory that resolves the flow details in the vicinity of the trailing edge. This approach will provide the circulation dynamics without any need for an auxiliary condition (i.e., Kutta-like condition). Moreover, to generalize this approach, machine learning tools will be employed to extract information about the circulation dynamics from high-fidelity simulations. This modeling approach can be conceptually described by a bow tie architecture: a compressive mapping taking a high-dimensional input space (e.g., flow field from high-fidelity simulation) to a smaller, more compact lower-dimensional core model (e.g., one-dimensional circulation dynamics). Then, the potential flow theory, with the accurate circulation dynamics, will be used to recover a high-dimensional output space of the flow field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In most cases of practical interest, multiphase flows interact mechanically with deformable solids. Fluid-solid interactions have been widely studied for macroscale problems, where the effect of surface tension is negligible. However, due to the continuous miniaturization of manufactured objects and the importance of surface tension in natural phenomena, there is a critical need to better understand fluid-solid interactions where surface tension plays a predominant role. Using a unique and enabling computational method, this project will unravel the fundamental mechanisms of fluid-solid interactions that couple flow, nonlinear elasticity and surface tension. The proposed research will shed light on the process of spontaneous droplet motion on soft substrates, interfacial instabilities in soft capillary tubes, and pool boiling on deformable solid surfaces. The understanding of these phenomena may bring major advances in bioinspired droplet motion, microfluidics and multiphase heat transfer. The research will be integrated in the curriculum through an initiative to introduce simple concepts of fluid-structure interaction in undergraduate mechanical engineering courses. The project will also offer undergraduate summer research experiences and mentoring activities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand fluid-solid interactions where surface tension interacts with flow, fluid-fluid phase transformations and elastic forces.

This knowledge gap is limiting our progress on multiphase heat transfer, microfluidics, biofluids and microfabrication, among other science and engineering applications. The current project will leverage a unique computational approach to unveil the fundamental mechanisms controlling this fascinating coupled problem.

As a result, they are the most difficult courses to translate from an in-person learning environment to an online learning environment.  Approaches that have achieved some success include web-based simulations of traditional lab exercises and remote access to laboratory equipment. Nevertheless, it is challenging for faculty to design online replacements to their laboratory courses and most never attempted it until forced to do so by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In spring 2020, to maximize student safety and provide continued instruction, colleges and universities shifted all courses, including lab courses, to an online format.  At this time, fully online teaching and learning will extend through spring semester, and it is possible that it will be necessary for even longer.  This circumstance presents a unique, time-sensitive opportunity to measure the impact of the sudden, forced transition on teaching and learning in undergraduate physics lab courses.  This project will apply qualitative and quantitative approaches to study impacts of the shift on students and identify strategies used to develop online versions of in-person physics lab activities. <br/><br/>The investigator will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore how online labs affect students? understanding of physics and identify the approaches used by physics laboratory instructors to shift to an online learning environment.  The project has two specific aims:  (1) to measure the effects of the transition on students' learning and knowledge in physics and their expectations about how experimental physics works;  and (2) to identify and categorize the strategies taken by physics instructors to enable students to remotely experience laboratory-like learning. For the quantitative component of the study, the Investigator will use the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS), an established survey that her research group has previously developed and tested. The 30 questions in E-CLASS assess students' views about their strategies, habits of mind, and attitudes when doing experiments in physics lab classes. E-CLASS assigns scores to students based on their ratings of how closely their personal views align with those of experts, as well as how an experimental physicist would respond. The pre-instruction E-CLASS was administered in 51 courses involving over 6,000 students this year.  Thus, this project will allow analysis of the midterm transition to remote instruction on a large scale. The investigator will add supplemental questions to the post-instruction E-CLASS, as well as administer an instructor survey, to specifically probe the transition to remote labs. The additional questions and the instructor survey will allow the investigator to: (a) analyze which variables in remote teaching most impact E-CLASS scores; (b) compare lab teaching using remote instruction to lab teaching during previous semesters; (c) categorize tools used by instructors during the transition to remote labs; and (d) find common themes, challenges, and successes that will inform the qualitative component of the study. The qualitative component will involve interviews with both faculty and students to develop a case study that captures the details of the transition to remote labs. This project aims to build a better understanding of how the physics lab environment (including social interactions) contributes to students' views about the nature of experimentation and what it means to do experiments. These results will help education researchers who wish to study the advantages and limitations of different lab environments and remote strategies. In addition, the cataloging of different approaches to transitioning lab courses to remote learning will help increase instructors' knowledge of creative practices that they could use for lab courses both during an emergency and outside of one. With this knowledge, they might, for example, be able to increase opportunities for students who have limited access to in-person lab instruction such as students in rural areas.

The immediate focus of this project is to characterize small cell-secreted vesicles (exosomes) which are classified as circulating biomarkers associated with many types of disease including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, infectious, and neurodegenerative diseases. This research also has the potential to be expanded beyond exosomes to detect and study other small membrane bound vesicles including viruses. Thus, this high throughput detection tool can be utilized in a wide range of medical diagnosis and biomedical research which could potentially reduce the cost of healthcare by providing frequent, affordable, and early testing to patients. Furthermore this multidisciplinary project crosses the traditional boundaries between engineering, physics, and biomedical sciences which will provide students with a unique educational experience during their academic training. The undergraduate students  will be trained and exposed to the field of micro- nanotechnology and biomedical sciences by closely working with the graduate students and being mentored by the principal investigator. The proposed project will also educate public about the importance of the field of micro-nanotechnologies for medicine through YouTube channel and ?ThinkTV? program which will be broadcasting in Southwest Ohio.<br/> <br/>Exosomes are extracellular vesicles with diameters of ~30-120 nm, released from many cell types into the extracellular space. They are composed of a lipid bilayer membrane containing various receptors and tetraspanin proteins. They also encapsulate nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids in their lumen. Exosomes are promising biomarkers for several reasons: 1) they are highly abundant in all bodily fluids and therefore easily accessible; 2) their composition reflects their cellular origins and can therefore serve as indicators of pathology; and 3) they are stable. Also, it has been shown that exosomes secreted from different cellular origins, in particular pathogenic exosomes, undergo compositional changes and could have additional membrane receptors and/or elevated or suppressed levels of nucleic acids which can be associated with their total electric charges and dipoles. However, use of exosomes as biomarkers has been hampered by the lack of workable technologies to reliably isolate and rigorously characterize their unique properties in a timely manner.  Although, some of the biophysical properties of exosomes such as size, density and morphology have been characterized before, their dielectric property which is associated with their unique compositional charges has not yet been investigated. The proposed label-free lab-on-a-chip device will utilize controllable electrokinetic forces across an array of borosilicate micropipettes to rapidly entrap exosomes at the tip of the pipettes and characterize the vesicles based on their unique dielectric properties by measuring their impedance. The impedance measurement will be conducted across an array of microelectrodes embedded in close proximity to the pipettes? tips as an alternative current (AC) is applied at a wide range of frequency spectrum (500 KHz to 50 MHz). The AC field at a wide frequency range will polarize the bound and unbound charges associate with exosomes? structure. The difference in impedance measurements will be linked to exosomes? unique dielectric properties which includes their membrane capacitance and cytosolic conductance. Additionally, the impedance of exosomes secreted from different cellular origins and size distribution will be measured and their uniqueness in dielectric properties will be investigated. This rapid and label-free electrokinetic device can be further evolved as a diagnostic tool for initial non-invasive detection of pathogenic exosomes while keeping their compositions intact for further downstream analysis<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New types of surface treatments that exhibit antipathogenic ?contact-kill? capabilities are urgently sought to protect public health and welfare. To this end, cuprous oxide is reported as a highly effective antimicrobial compound; while the origin of its antimicrobial property remains unknown, it is hypothesized to be a consequence of atomic-level copper vacancies in its crystal lattice that provide highly charged atomic environments. These locally energetic regions in the lattice are thought to disrupt and destroy cell membranes and/or the protein shell of viruses. Interdisciplinary research quantifies connections between the cuprous oxide lattice condition and its biocidal activity to permit rational engineering of this abundant, inexpensive and easily handled material for incorporation into coatings for public spaces.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Correlations between the cuprous oxide lattice defect condition and its antipathogenic response to representative organisms are quantified through structural and electronic probes, including magnetometry and photoabsorption. Lattice-defective cuprous oxide, synthesized by high-energy mechanical processing, is incorporated into coatings and subjected to biological assays to quantify any reduction in viable bacteria and viruses after prolonged exposure. Students and junior researchers involved in this project work at the typically unfrequented intersection of inorganic materials science and biology. These tests, which are designed to simulate actual conditions where a pathogen might survive on a given surface, provide enabling knowledge to engineer cuprous oxide, and perhaps other oxide materials, for antipathogenic purposes to address the current COVID-19 pandemic and to proactively confront future health challenges.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Initiated during a time of uncertainty, this project will: (1) capture the ephemeral nature of undergraduate education experiences before national recovery milestones are achieved; and (2) inform efforts to adapt undergraduate STEM education during crises.  The project team will collect data about institutional characteristics and crisis communication messages, as well as about experiences of individual faculty and students.  These data will be analyzed to identify pathways through which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced teaching and learning within undergraduate STEM education.  The findings of this project will be used to develop actionable recommendations for institutions of higher education, including crisis communication strategies, guidelines for pedagogy in times of crisis, and checklists of resources.  As the STEM workforce plays a critical role in the economic health of the U.S.  in normal and disaster situations, this effort to rapidly collect data and learn from this situation will contribute to the security and well-being of society.  It is expected that the results will also support a more resilient, globally competitive next generation of STEM workers.  <br/><br/>The project?s specific aims are to: (1) examine teaching and learning experiences of undergraduate faculty and students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) examine the effects of faculty and student reactions on undergraduate STEM teaching and learning; and (3) leverage findings to develop actionable recommendations for colleges and universities to best prepare and protect their faculty, staff, and students and the integrity of undergraduate STEM education.  The goal of these activities is to answer key research questions: How do institutions? COVID-19 policies influence faculty and student attitudes, perceptions, and behavior related to STEM teaching and learning? What teaching and learning resources were most important for undergraduate STEM faculty and students? How do these effects on undergraduate STEM education develop over time?

Faculty and students are unlikely to accurately later recall the extent to which they were able to adapt to changes, the extent to which changes created distress, and how they coped with events.  Using the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, faculty and students from a stratified random sample of representative institutions will be recruited to participate in an online survey and semi-structured interviews conducted across three time points.  Grounded in the research literatures of crisis communication, organizational science, and disaster management, this project addresses gaps in undergraduate STEM education research related to faculty and student reactions to disruptive contexts, characteristics of institutions that make them resilient toward disruptive contexts, and institutional learning from disruptive contexts.  The findings will be disseminated to institutions of higher education and through a public web site relating to the resources most critical for fostering resilience among faculty and staff when adapting to a disrupted educational context.  In addition, participating institutions and individuals will receive customized reports and resources.

Many published palynological studies done in the Tampa Bay area and the southern parts of Florida. However, there are no published materials on the Northeast area of the state.  A Burkard volumetric sampler will be used to trap airborne pollen grains. The sampler will be on the roof of Edward Waters College. This area is in the poorest, most urban, and predominantly African American area of Jacksonville and is known as Health Zone 1 by public health officials. Another sampler will be place on the roof of a building in the wealthiest Health Zones (Health Zone 6) to compare pollen grain concentrations. Pollen concentration will be determined after transferring samples onto microscope slides for staining with Caberla?s solution and then identification and quantification using the single longitudinal traverse method.  This seminal aeropalynological study will allow characterization of the local vegetation in Northeast Florida. Undergraduates will gain an appreciation of Forensic palynology in which they can use this ideal biomarker for associating people and objects to specific places. Undergraduate students will experience how meteorological conditions can influence the pollen season. Global warming and climate change will affect the pollen patterns and will affect the most vulnerable population such as residents of Health Zone 1. Long-term pollen monitoring through this volumetric method would generate data to establish a phenological pollen calendar for Northeast Florida. The determination of the pollen content in the air and the data analysis will enable the characterization of pollen types with a view to correlating the results with pollen allergy data from the Department of Health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect diverse species of animals. There is a variation in susceptibility to and severity of disease between species. This variation suggests that some species have genetic differences that dictate susceptibility to COVID-19.

Failure of tailings storage facilities lead to devastating consequences for the environment and civil infrastructure, and lead to loss of human lives. The 2008 Kingston fossil plant failure in Tennessee, an environmental disaster with associated losses on the order of 1.2 billion dollars, is a prime example of the tremendous impact that a tailings storage facility failure can cause. Future failures could have similar devastating consequences for the local and state economies, populations, and industries. Therefore, evaluating the safety of tailings storage facilities is vitally important in any region where mining is active, such as in Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and others. Mine tailings are intermediate soil materials often classified as sandy silt to almost pure silt. Conditions for static liquefaction (sudden loss of stability even in the absence of extreme events such as earthquakes) on these materials cannot be evaluated using known engineering procedures. This research will create new knowledge for improving resilient design of tailings storage facilities against static liquefaction and provide insights into creating new design protocols to mitigate potential disasters in the United States and worldwide that are induced by the static liquefaction of mine tailings. The research will also establish an educational and outreach program focused on curriculum development on intermediate soil materials for K-12 students, through STEM centers at Georgia Tech.<br/><br/>Through an integrated experimentally and numerically-based program inspired by recent failures in tailings storage facilities, this research advances liquefaction engineering by investigating (1) the mechanical response of mine tailings under standard and non-standard stress paths, while considering a range of boundary conditions; (2) the conditions for static liquefaction under drained loading conditions, where recent failure events point to a lack of thorough understanding despite the opposite perception among geotechnical engineers; (3) the micromechanics of mine tailings under shearing through image-based experimental techniques; and (4) the effects of micromechanical configurations (i.e. fabric) and induced anisotropy on triggering static liquefaction by using the novel anisotropic critical state theory. Gaining insights into the key parameters that govern the triggering of static liquefaction in mine tailings and developing well-calibrated numerical procedures using the anisotropic critical state theory will transform the ability of geotechnical engineering profession to more effectively evaluate and mitigate the risk of static liquefaction in mine tailings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disruption of this sequence may lead to poor performance, exit from the major or college, and extended time to graduation.  These negative student outcomes could in turn damage national economic competitiveness by limiting the number of engineers available to enter the workforce.  This project will gather time-sensitive data to investigate the impact of the rapid shift to online instruction due to COVID-19.  In contrast to their highly structured in-person classes. virtual environments place much greater responsibility on students to manage their own learning,  As a result, undergraduate students, including those at military academic institutions such as the Citadel, are experiencing increased mental demands (i.e. cognitive load) as they tackle the rigors of engineering coursework, while simultaneously exercising self-directed learning skills.  This project will gather and analyse data about the impact of online courses on the cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness of Citadel engineering students.   This information has the potential to be broadly applicable to undergraduate engineering education, as well as to other STEM disciplines and to education levels before and beyond college.<br/><br/>The project focuses on a unique and under-represented population of engineering students who, under normal circumstances, must complete military training in addition to satisfying academic requirements.  Students? cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness will be measured using established survey instruments and student focus groups before and after the shift to online learning, as well as after the return to on-campus operations.  Three research questions, undergirded by cognitive load theory, will guide the investigations:  (1) How do students? cognitive loads and/or self-directed learning readiness differ between in-person and online course? (2) To what extent are changes in self-directed learning readiness associated with changes in cognitive load? (3) Which demographic factors (if any) impact changes in cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness?  The project team will use a mixed methods approach to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data collected from surveys and focus groups to determine the magnitude and duration of changes in students? cognitive load and self-directed learning readiness.  Findings from the proposed work have the potential to advance knowledge related to students? online learning experiences that can aid in improving course offerings as part of regular instruction, as well as situations in which continuity of instruction is threatened.  The intellectual merit of the project lies in its potential to contribute to foundational knowledge relating to issues of sudden and drastic shifts in educational environments as experienced by diverse students at a military institution.

At lower frequency, similar variants called sports arise during normal growth. These new variants can have great economic value, but relatively little is known of the causes, nature and evolutionary significance of these phenomena. This project will investigate these changes in potato. The methods suitable to analyze these genomic changes will be applicable to other crops, and will be made available to the scientific and plant breeding community.  Societal impact is expected along two lines. First, this project will address a largely ignored potential source of variation likely to affect leading economic species. Second, the project entails several outreach activities, with two objectives: 1) Familiarize young students in underrepresented communities with science studies and careers and 2) Train advanced students and professionals in genomic approaches applicable to plant breeding. These objectives will be achieved through a combination of publishing in outreach journals, provision of international workshops, and production of learning videos.<br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms and outcomes of genome instability and restructuring. The central hypothesis is that instability, while often deleterious, can also reshape the genome in ways that are less disruptive and potentially adaptive, such as by causing change or loss of heterozygosity, and dosage variation. Elucidating the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of these changes will help clarify their role in natural and artificial selection, and inform prediction, identification and, if appropriate, exploitation of these changes. The work will focus on the autotetraploid potato genome, in which we have documented extensive genomic changes in tissue culture regenerated potatoes, ranging from aneuploidy to indels, extreme rearrangements, but also more subtle changes in heterozygosity consistent with homologous DNA repair. Analysis of variation in potato suggests that genome instability varies according to environment and that it can occur during normal growth. The specific aims are to: i) Characterize the molecular patterns associated with somaclonal variation in potato. By examining resulting rearrangements, hypotheses on potential mechanisms, such as homologous vs. nonhomologous repair of dsDNA breaks, will be tested, ii) Study molecular patterns associated with differentiation of potato clones. Genomic analysis of clonally propagated potato will test the hypothesis that somatic homologous recombination results in variation and, iii) Investigate relation of dsDNA breaks to loss of heterozygosity. This objective will leverage induced and spontaneous loss of heterozygosity models to test possible mechanisms of dsDNA break repair, such as mitotic crossover and break-induced recombination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such airborne transmission paths can be associated with droplets ejected from natural human respiratory functions such as sneezing, coughing, speaking, and breathing. Even in the context of social distancing and face masks, there are several essential functions associated with hospitals, grocery stores, transit, and other essential confined workplaces that force interactions and fuel pathogen transmission. One potential method to reduce the transmission of airborne pathogens is to reduce the number of small droplets formed from the human respiratory function. It is generally known that small droplets (such as fog, mist, etc.) can remain suspended for long time periods. Such droplets enable transmitting pathogens for long time periods. Since large droplets (such as rain) are prone to fall from the air, pathogens in these droplets are less susceptible to airborne transmission paths. The aim of this research is to alter the host?s fluid properties such that droplets formed during human respiratory functions remain larger, travel shorter distances, and fall reducing the propensity for airborne transmission.  <br/><br/>The project seeks to quantify the droplet character formed during human respiratory function when the host?s saliva properties are altered. Simple fluids-related solutions associated with altering the fluid properties of the host such as formulated confections (lozenges/gum/candy) will change saliva droplet breakup modes resulting in larger droplets that travel shorter distances and fall. The aim is to understand how fluid properties can reduce metrics associated with a pathogen?s airborne transmission path. During the human respiratory function, droplets are formed through complex processes driven by a pulsed, turbulent jet with many underlying interfacial instabilities. These processes have not been studied from the aspect of altering the host?s salvia fluid properties. The project will develop this knowledge gap using a combination of experiments and numerical predictions oriented around answering three specific studies: (i) Understanding the role of viscosity and surface tension in droplet characteristics, (ii) Evaluating how aerating saliva alters droplet characteristics, and (iii) Determining safe compounds that reduce airborne transmission while remaining comfortable to a person. In addressing these scientific questions, this effort aims to develop a new tool to reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 (and other airborne pathogens). The effort is tailored to inform the public, scientists, and engineers (through press, fast-track publications, and professional meetings) of the developed science within a timeline that enables product development and wide-scale implementation that supports the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Initiated during a time of uncertainty, this project will: (1) capture the ephemeral nature of undergraduate education experiences before national recovery milestones are achieved; and (2) inform efforts to adapt undergraduate STEM education during crises.  The project team will collect data about institutional characteristics and crisis communication messages, as well as about experiences of individual faculty and students.  These data will be analyzed to identify pathways through which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced teaching and learning within undergraduate STEM education.  The findings of this project will be used to develop actionable recommendations for institutions of higher education, including crisis communication strategies, guidelines for pedagogy in times of crisis, and checklists of resources.  As the STEM workforce plays a critical role in the economic health of the U.S.  in normal and disaster situations, this effort to rapidly collect data and learn from this situation will contribute to the security and well-being of society.

The goal of these activities is to answer key research questions: How do institutions? COVID-19 policies influence faculty and student attitudes, perceptions, and behavior related to STEM teaching and learning? What teaching and learning resources were most important for undergraduate STEM faculty and students? How do these effects on undergraduate STEM education develop over time? Given the rapidly changing nature of the situation, individual-level data that are needed to answer the research questions are inherently ephemeral.

The findings will be disseminated to institutions of higher education and through a public web site relating to the resources most critical for fostering resilience among faculty and staff when adapting to a disrupted educational context.  In addition, participating institutions and individuals will receive customized reports and resources.

Microfluidic devices with tiny channels of varying widths are used to process mixtures of deformable particles and fluids and to manipulate DNA molecules. However, microfluidic devices frequently clog near constrictions, which is expensive since the device must be replaced when this occurs. Clogging has been studied extensively for rigid particles, like grains flowing out of a silo, but clogging of deformable particles is less well understood. In particular, it is unclear how particle deformability and stickiness or cohesion affects clogging. For example, will deformable and cohesive particles change shape and flow past each other at constrictions, or will they form arches and clog the system? This project combines experiments of emulsion droplets flowed through microfluidic devices with novel computer simulations of deformable particles to understand how they clog. This work will aid in future designs of critical microfluidic devices involved in industrial processing, filtration, and analysis of biological samples of cell-fluid mixtures. <br/><br/>Flow-induced jamming, or clogging, is observed across a wide range of systems, from flows of granular materials in silos to flows of blood cells through veins. Clogging is well studied in the case of hard, frictional grains, but is poorly understood when particles are deformable and cohesive. This project employs experiments of suspensions of emulsion droplets with tunable deformability and adhesion flowed through microfluidic devices, along with novel simulations of flows of explicitly deformable particles designed to model emulsion droplets. The combined experimental-computational approach can disentangle the effects of deformability, particle mechanical response, and adhesion on clogging probability. One key focus is the role of particle rearrangements during clogs in unjamming the suspensions. During clogs of granular materials, particles are static and clogs have long lifetimes. However, if particles are deformable, particle shape relaxation and stress redistribution in a clogged suspension can lead to intermittent clog release and avalanching. Additionally, this project will investigate how the Beverloo Law, which describes how flow rate changes with constriction width, changes in the case of deformable and adhesive particles. The combination of computational and experimental studies will aid the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework to predict when a clog will form given the particle properties, flow rate, and constriction width. With the increased use of microfluidic devices to analyze suspensions of colloidal particles and cells, a predictive framework for clogging based on single-particle properties like deformability, elasticity and adhesion is required to design the next generation of efficient high-throughput microfluidic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Populations of bees and other pollinators are in decline worldwide, which has major implications for ecosystem health and agricultural production interests. Colony collapse disorder, involving colonies of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is just one dramatic example of rapid loss of pollinators. Although a large number of viruses infect bees, it is not known how these viruses impact bee decline. A bee cell line would benefit science because it would allow scientists to identify how bee viruses infect and kill bees. The goal of this research is to establish and characterize the first immortalized cell lines from Apis mellifera. The resulting immortalized cell line(s) will provide an invaluable resources for the virology research field. In addition to helping the honey bee scientific community, this research may help understand disease dynamics in other pollinator species, many of which are important for US agriculture. This cell line may be the basis for commercially-available testing kits to identify or track bee diseases. The research uses funding to train graduate and undergraduate students, including under-represented students. As such this funding is training the next generation of leaders in science. Researchers will share their findings to the public through the use of beekeeping workshops, and honey bee health and research awareness activities through farmer?s markets and video documentaries. <br/><br/>The lack of immortalized bee cell lines has greatly hampered research on bee viruses. Thus far, only primary cell cultures have been established from Apis mellifera, the European honey bee. These primary cell cultures are difficult to establish and maintain, and suffer from several major drawbacks including the presence of multiple resident viruses, extremely slow cell division rates, and limitations on the number of passages before reaching senescence. This research will examine the ability of candidate honey bee genes to immortalize A. mellifera embryonic cells. This will be accomplished by stably expressing candidate genes in primary embryonic cells isolated from embryos and monitoring growth and survival of the resulting cells. Primary cells isolated from different developmental stages of the embryo will be used, in order to attempt to obtain immortalized cell lines that represent various cell types. Cell clones with optimum growth characteristics that are able to be stably passaged will be selected. The resulting immortalized cell lines will be screened for resident viruses by deep sequencing, and any viruses present will be cleared by using a combination of RNA interference and single cell cloning. The resulting virus-free, immortalized honey bee cell lines will be made available to the research community. If successful, this approach will also provide a template for researchers to isolate immortalized cell lines from other bee species.

In linguistics, 'differential marking' refers to morphological patterning where a nominal, such as a subject, occurs with special encoding. With this encoding, a speaker can communicate non-grammatical information about that nominal, such as surprise, unpredictability, or unexpectedness of the involvement of an entity in an event. Speakers do not consciously use differential marking to package information. Rather, there appear to be a complex combination of grammatical, discourse, semantic, and pragmatic factors that predict differential marking, including inherent properties of the noun (e.g., person, animacy, or count versus mass), properties of the predicate (transitivity, completed action), or the position of a nominal in longer connected speech (e.g., mentioned for the first time in a conversation or story).  The project will include the training of students in coding and grammatical analysis. Language data, the coding protocol, and Python-based tools will be archived and freely accessible at University of North Texas Digital Library and/or through a GitHub repository.<br/><br/>This project uses an innovative documentary method to gather information on factors determining differential marking. First, native speaking linguists of the investigated languages will code nominals in connected discourse for factors associated with differential marking. When non-speakers analyze data for differential marking, nuanced meanings can be lost in translation. Coding by trained native speakers will more accurately capture the meanings intended by the speaker. The project will develop a coding manual to standardize coding. Second, discussions about the data with groups of non-linguist speakers will be used to refine coding. Group discussions on grammar tend to evoke scenarios of usage and interpretation that are not recalled by investigators working on data on their own. Third, the project will develop Python-based tools to compare factors for differential marking across various data sets, both within one language and across different languages, to find statistically salient correspondences between factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic tenet is that carbon forms four chemical bonds. In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Todd Hudnall of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Texas State University - San Marcos seeks to prepare substances that violate the four-bonds per carbon principle. Specifically, compounds called carbenes that contain carbon with only two bonds are prepared. Because of the unusually low number of bonds, carbenes are very reactive and have important electronic properties. The methods that are developed to prepare the carbenes are extended to the related elements, germanium and tin. These synthetic methods potentially useful, low temperature ways to access metastable alloys. In addition to training undergraduate and graduate students, this project may ultimately result in the discovery of novel materials that may benefit society in applications ranging from quantum computing to single molecular magnets to catalysts.  Professor Hudnall has maintained a collaborative outreach program with the McKenna Children?s Museum called ?Laboratory Workstations.? This program engages children, ages 3-10, in hands-on simple chemistry experiments in mock gloveboxes, and is also inclusive of local chemistry students from Canyon High School. Texas State University is an Hispanic Serving Institution.  This project provides research experiences to students from groups underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to prepare electrophilic carbene ligands and related main group analogs. Sets of carbenes, whose electrophilic character and attendant pi-acidity can be systematically increased by a lowering of their respective Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy levels, are targeted using computations. These compounds and related germanium and tin species with exceptionally small singlet-triplet gaps are prepared. Among these are diamidosilylenes, germylenes, stannylenes, and cationic heterocyclic carbenes. One question that is investigated is why diamidocarbenes can be photolyzed to a triplet excited state where other carbenes cannot. The photochemistry of the carbenes is explored and applications as electrophilic carbene-supported main group catalysts and as precursors for the low-temperature generation of main group alloys are developed. The program serves students from underrepresented groups by their inclusion in the research project and though outreach programs to K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By the year 2050, up to 10 million lives per year could be at risk. New strategies will be needed to counter this threat. Vaccines have been developed to safely and effectively prevent dangerous bacterial infections. This project seeks to address current limitations in vaccine production. Cell-free technology for vaccine production that can be easily scaled up will be developed. This could lead to portable, on-demand vaccine development and production. The project will advance the biomanufacturing of conjugate vaccines. This would improve their availability to resource-poor communities. In parallel, hands-on learning modules will be developed and delivered to underrepresented high school students, and to  undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The bacterial cell surface is decorated with complex sugar structures. These include capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and O-polysaccharides (O-PS). These structures are important virulence factors, adhesion mediators, and immunomodulators. CPS and O-PS structures are typically absent from the surfaces of host cells. These polysaccharides can, therefore, be formulated as vaccine subunits and used to protect humans against life-threatening bacterial infections. Conjugate vaccines are a type of subunit vaccine whereby polysaccharide antigens are linked to a protein carrier. They are among the safest and most effective methods for inducing immunity against pathogenic bacteria. Current production technology is technically complex and relies on living cells. Refrigeration is necessary at every step along the distribution chain. As a result, manufacturing is centralized, capital intensive, and requires highly skilled labor. This project will create a scalable, cell-free biosynthesis technology for generating conjugate vaccine candidates. Experimental and computational approaches will be combined to develop and optimize a one-pot cell-free glycoprotein synthesis system. These glycoconjugates can be stored in freeze-dried formats and reconstituted simply by adding water. A complementary technology, shotgun scanning glycomutagenesis, will enable comprehensive evaluation of glycosylation efficiency as a function of conjugation site and antigen loading density, which will be correlated with vaccine immunogenicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To fully understand and predict behavior of bacteria, it is necessary to connect its molecular makeup with its observable characteristics. This often requires individual bacteria first be isolated at high purity, which is currently difficult to do. The goal of this NSF CAREER award is to investigate use of photodegradable hydrogel materials for identification and isolation of rare bacteria cells with unique function for molecular analysis. Hydrogels are three-dimensional, water-soluble polymers that can be used to encapsulate collections of cells for observation. A fundamental understanding of both chemical and physical characteristics of hydrogels that lead to stable and effective encapsulation of bacteria will first be established. These hydrogels will then be designed to degrade following exposure to low-energy, near-infrared light unharmful to bacteria, which will allow for release of live, single cells from the hydrogel at any time. The outcome will be a new, materials-based approach to microbial isolation that will be low cost and highly translational to the standard microbiology lab. These hydrogels will have broader application to other emerging areas in microbiology including targeted delivery of therapeutic bacteria to disease sites. The integrated educational goal of the project is to develop global-minded students who are well prepared for interdisciplinary research careers at the interface of materials science and microbiology through the Joint Microbe-Material Scholars (JMMS) program. The JMMS platform will leverage established programs at Kansas State University for engagement and recruitment of underrepresented minority students throughout the state of Kansas and will provide its scholars with international research experiences.  This project is jointly funded by the Biomaterials Program of the NSF Division of Materials Research, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>Abstract (technical)<br/>Photodegradable hydrogels have been intensively studied for application in tissue engineering and targeted drug delivery. However, these materials are largely unexplored for use in microbiology, but have great potential for on-demand delivery of bacteria as well as for use in low-cost cell isolation methods. These capabilities are critical for advancing our knowledge of the microbial world and for using bacteria in emerging therapeutic applications. The overall goal of this CAREER proposal is to provide a fundamental understanding of hydrogel material properties that provide stable bacteria encapsulation, culture, transport, and release from photodegradable hydrogels with high viability and precision. Step-growth polymerizations that use thiol-Michael addition reactions for bacteria encapsulation into stable, polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels will be identified, and the impact of hydrogel mesh size and elasticity on bacteria proliferation and transport will be investigated. Up-conversion nanoparticles will be integrated into the hydrogel matrix to investigate release of individual bacteria cells using a patterned NIR light source. Finally, these novel materials will be tested for isolation of rare bacteria with viable but nonculturable phenotypes for follow-up molecular analysis. Knowledge gained from these tasks will inform the rational design of hydrogels for isolation of single bacteria with unique function for 'omics'-based analysis and delivery of live, therapeutic bacteria to targeted disease sites. The research will be integrated into the educational plan through the Joint Microbe-Material Scholars program, an educational platform designed to produce global-minded, interdisciplinary students through four components: (1) an international student exchange with collaborators in food microbiology, (2) an external outreach mechanism designed to engage and recruit minority students throughout the state of Kansas, (3) a microbe-material course that uses an interdisciplinary guided-inquiry teaching method, and (4) public engagement.

The speed and low cost could provide the first point-of-contact molecular tests diagnostic for diseases such as COVID-19. Two minutes and $2 is fast enough and inexpensive enough to perform such routine screening in airports to detect asymptomatic spreaders as they embark or disembark from airplanes.

Understanding how plants work under current and future climates is therefore critical to human welfare. Plant leaf hairs (trichomes) are among the most complex, ubiquitous, important, and little understood biological traits. Leaf trichomes are present in more than half of plant species, have diverse structure and arrangements, and influence the environmental tolerances and productivity of both crop and non-crop species. The effects of trichomes include reflecting excessive light, preventing accumulation of surface water, reducing infection by pathogens, enhancing water capture from saturated air, reducing water loss to dry air, and fending off herbivores. Yet, leaf trichomes have been studied in detail for very few species, and therefore have been typically ignored in predictions of plant production, evolution and ecology. This study will refine and develop state-of-the-art methods to micro-image trichomes in diverse species, and use experiments and models to determine how their costs and benefits affect whole-plant performance. Additionally, the project team will analyze how trichomes vary across environments and through evolution for species of grapevine, for the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, and for entire floras of California and Hawaii. The project will train graduate students and post-doctoral scientists in state of the art technology and approaches to plant research, and will integrate general education, high school and undergraduate education with public dissemination of research, thereby increasing public awareness and fascination with plant structure and function. <br/><br/>Through its collaborative research team, this project applies an innovative synthetic approach combining expertise in mathematics, physics, physiology, ecology and evolution.  By integrating greenhouse and lab experimentation with state of the art 3D micro-imaging, herbarium work, experimental measurements, mechanistic and statistical modeling and phylogenetic analyses the research will quantify the anatomical diversity of leaf trichomes, their contributions to light absorption, water relations (wettability and foliar water uptake), gas exchange, and protection from herbivory, and their ecological and evolutionary associations. The first aim of this project is to combine cutting edge micro-visualization, experimentation and modeling to quantify the structure and multiple functions of leaf hairs in diverse species from at least 17 genera of flowering plants. The second aim is to integrate these multiple streams of data on the diversity of leaf trichomes and its influence on five known functions to determine how the net benefits scale up to influence whole plant performance. Third, an even wider perspective is necessary to determine how leaf trichomes evolved with climate within lineages and across floras. The project will leverage available data and herbarium material to focus on test cases of large-scale evolutionary and ecological patterns in leaf trichomes. The project?s Broader Impacts will provide curricula based on novel results via the UCLA Botanical Garden, and online modules including 3D models that can be accessed online and 3D printed.

This process and the deployment of data-centric technologies have recently brought unprecedented advances in many scientific fields, as well as increased global prosperity with the advent of knowledge-based economies and systems. At a high level, this revolution is driven by two thrusts: the modern technologies which allow for the collection of complex data sets, and the theories and algorithms we use to make sense of them. That said, and for all its benefits, extracting actionable knowledge from data is difficult. Observations gathered in uncontrolled environments are often high-dimensional, complex and noisy; and even when controlled experiments are used, the intricate systems that underlie them --- like those from meteorology, chemistry, medicine and biology --- can yield data sets with highly nontrivial underlying topology. This refers to properties such as the number of disconnected pieces (i.e., clusters), the existence of holes or the orientability of the data space. The research funded through this CAREER award will leverage ideas from algebraic topology to address data science questions like visualization and representation of complex data sets, as well as the challenges posed by nontrivial topology when designing learning systems for prediction and classification. This work will be integrated into the educational program of the PI through the creation of an online TDA (Topological Data Analysis) academy, with the dual purpose of lowering the barrier of entry into the field for data scientists and academics, as well as increasing the representation of underserved communities in the field of computational mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding the set of maps between topological spaces has led to rich and sophisticated mathematics, for it subsumes algebraic invariants like homotopy groups and generalized (co)homology theories. And while several data science questions are discrete versions of mapping space problems --- including nonlinear dimensionality reduction and supervised learning --- the corresponding theoretical and algorithm treatment is currently lacking. This CAREER award will contribute towards remedying this situation. The research program articulated here seeks to launch a novel research program addressing the theory and algorithms of how the underlying topology of a data set can be leveraged for data modeling (e.g., in dimensionality reduction) as well as when learning maps between complex data spaces (e.g., in supervised learning). This work will yield methodologies for the computation of topology-aware and robust multiscale coordinatizations for data via classifying spaces, a computational theory of topological obstructions to the robust extension of maps between data sets, as well as the introduction of modern deep learning paradigms in order to learn maps between non-Euclidean data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how plants work under current and future climates is therefore critical to human welfare. Plant leaf hairs (trichomes) are among the most complex, ubiquitous, important, and little understood biological traits. Leaf trichomes are present in more than half of plant species, have diverse structure and arrangements, and influence the environmental tolerances and productivity of both crop and non-crop species. The effects of trichomes include reflecting excessive light, preventing accumulation of surface water, reducing infection by pathogens, enhancing water capture from saturated air, reducing water loss to dry air, and fending off herbivores. Yet, leaf trichomes have been studied in detail for very few species, and therefore have been typically ignored in predictions of plant production, evolution and ecology. This study will refine and develop state-of-the-art methods to micro-image trichomes in diverse species, and use experiments and models to determine how their costs and benefits affect whole-plant performance. Additionally, the project team will analyze how trichomes vary across environments and through evolution for species of grapevine, for the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, and for entire floras of California and Hawaii. The project will train graduate students and post-doctoral scientists in state of the art technology and approaches to plant research, and will integrate general education, high school and undergraduate education with public dissemination of research, thereby increasing public awareness and fascination with plant structure and function. <br/><br/>Through its collaborative research team, this project applies an innovative synthetic approach combining expertise in mathematics, physics, physiology, ecology and evolution.  By integrating greenhouse and lab experimentation with state of the art 3D micro-imaging, herbarium work, experimental measurements, mechanistic and statistical modeling and phylogenetic analyses the research will quantify the anatomical diversity of leaf trichomes, their contributions to light absorption, water relations (wettability and foliar water uptake), gas exchange, and protection from herbivory, and their ecological and evolutionary associations. The first aim of this project is to combine cutting edge micro-visualization, experimentation and modeling to quantify the structure and multiple functions of leaf hairs in diverse species from at least 17 genera of flowering plants. The second aim is to integrate these multiple streams of data on the diversity of leaf trichomes and its influence on five known functions to determine how the net benefits scale up to influence whole plant performance. Third, an even wider perspective is necessary to determine how leaf trichomes evolved with climate within lineages and across floras. The project will leverage available data and herbarium material to focus on test cases of large-scale evolutionary and ecological patterns in leaf trichomes. The project?s Broader Impacts will provide curricula based on novel results via the UCLA Botanical Garden, and online modules including 3D models that can be accessed online and 3D printed. All data will be deposited in a publicly available database.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to cool this melt, seawater penetrates the ocean crust, resulting in many chemical changes of both the rocks of the crust as well as the oceans. Thus, ?hydrothermal? fluid flow is a primary mechanism for mass and heat transfer between the deep Earth and the oceans, accounting for approximately one third of the global yearly heat loss. Of particular interest are hydrothermal systems hosted in rocks that were brought up from the deeper mantle, so-called ?ultramafic? rocks due to their composition. This is because: (1) the mechanisms that produce such mantle exposures are not fully understood; (2) there is potential for these ultramafic rocks to sequester CO2 sequestration; and (3) the fluids resulting from hydration of ultramafic rocks can create unique chemical environments that are important for biology on earth. This project will use an existing dataset acquired in 2013 that probes the subsurface of such an ultramafic exposure beneath an active hydrothermal system along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This project will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of science, in particular by investigating the linkages and interactions between mantle rocks, fluids, and (sub)surface ecosystems. This is a major scientific goal of the geoscience community and its importance has been highlighted in science plans providing guidance to scientists, funding agencies and policy makers, such as the IODP Science Plan for 2013-2023 or The National Academy of Sciences Sea Change 2015-2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences Report. This project will support a postdoctoral investigator, providing an opportunity for developing the early career of an independent scientist, and contributing to the new generation of geoscientists with expertise in advanced seismic imaging techniques. Such expertise is of great importance for the US industries in the field of exploration and production of natural resources. By making use of existing seismic datasets, this project will also leverage previous NSF investments in marine seismic acquisition. <br/><br/><br/>This project will conduct a multi-scale advanced seismic modeling and imaging study of a subset of a seismic data collected in 2013. These data were collected as part of the NSF-funded MARINER experiment in the Rainbow massif of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The dataset includes active-source long-streamer seismic reflection data, ocean bottom seismometer wide-angle data, and a microseismicity catalog. The approach will consist of (1) downward continuation and travel-time tomography, yielding intermediate resolution models of the P-wave velocity structure; (2) elastic full waveform inversion, yielding high-resolution models of the P-wave velocity structure; (3) reverse time migration, yielding geometrically accurate, high fidelity seismic reflection images; and (4) micro-earthquake tomography, yielding a km-scale regional 3-D model of the S-wave velocity structure. These models and images will be used to investigate the physical properties of magmatic rocks within the oceanic crust. They will help to quantify their partially molten or solidified state, and how they are linked to active and inactive hydrothermal fields. Furthermore, the models and images will illuminate fluid pathways and small-scale faulting, potential connecting the seafloor hydrothermal fields to the magmatic system at depth. The results, when jointly interpreted with existing seafloor geology observations, seafloor sampling and near-bottom imagery from previous studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of magmatism and other geological controls on hydrothermal activity in regions of mantle exposures along mid-ocean ridges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their complex I/O patterns pose numerous challenges due to contention, congestion, and performance variabilities at multiple layers of the I/O stack including I/O middleware libraries, parallel file systems and storage devices. This IRES project aims to organize an international collaboration between Japan and the U.S. for research on I/O performance efficiency and data reliability for data-intensive analytics and deep learning applications. The IRES Track-1 site will be hosted at the Florida State University (FSU), through close collaboration with the RIKEN Center for Computational Science (R-CCS) in Kobe, Japan. As a world-renowned national lab, R-CCS has hosted the fastest K supercomputer in Japan and has been chosen as the site to host Japan?s future exascale computer, Fugaku. This project leverages such facilities for research and training of IRES participants and enriches the portfolio of international collaborations between the U.S. and Japan. Each year for the duration of the project, five (4 graduate and 1 undergraduate) U.S. students will be selected to participate in the IRES program to visit and do research at the R-CCS for 10 weeks. <br/><br/>This project pursues cross-layer optimizations on I/O middleware libraries, parallel file systems, and storage configurations, serving data-intensive analytics and deep learning applications.

It is important for society to understand these environmental issues because they impact natural resources needed to sustain life on Earth. One of the biggest challenges in gaining knowledge about how the non-living and living world works is that most research in environmental science has been done at small, local scales, but many current environmental issues operate at regional, continental, and global scales. Thus, scaling up environmental research across space is vital. Macrosystems biology seeks to understand research on biosphere processes and their complex interactions with climate, land use, and changes in species geographic distributions at regional to continental scales. Such large-scale scientific research demands a collaborative team of scientists, including individuals with the ability to integrate across disciplinary and cultural differences, so that insights made are of the highest scientific quality and are socially equitable. Given the collaborative nature of macrosystems biology, advances in this field are made through shared knowledge of the science and of how to promote productive, diverse teams. This meeting will promote knowledge sharing by providing an opportunity for researchers to share insights into macrosystems biology advances and into team science. Through professional development and engagement of a diverse group of scientists, collaboration of active researchers, and generation of new ideas and synthesis of research projects, this meeting will broaden the impact of currently funded Macrosystems biology research. Specific efforts will be made to emphasize perspectives of early-career and traditionally under-represented researchers in all aspects of the workshop.<br/><br/>This conference proposal will support a meeting of project scientists funded through the NSF Macrosystems Biology and National Ecological Observatory Network Enabled Science (MSB-NES) program.

RAPID Project is to develop a diagnostic platform that is well-suited for widespread monitoring of infection during pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 threat.  It consists of a low-cost mailer that can be used at home, returned in the mail in a safely-sealed, confidential envelope and quickly scanned upon receipt without opening to diagnose infection.  These results can be relayed to the user immediately and a real-time outbreak map along with affected demographics can be produced.  This approach off-loads the burden of diagnostics from health workers, eliminates the increased use of limited personal protective equipment, and provides a better response to outbreaks.  Resources could be more efficiently allocated by local and federal governments, and workers could make more informed decisions on staying at home or going to work.  Moreover, this project will train a team of four students to collaborate quickly together to meet the design constraints of an actual product based on technologies from their thesis work. Commercial impact beyond COVID-19 would be a highly modular platform that can be rapidly adapted to other current diagnostic needs (HIV, tropical diseases) as well as future pandemics.  <br/><br/>The proposed project overcomes the current methods of COVID-19 detection which are limited by 1) healthcare workers having to collect samples, 2) shipment of biological specimens, and 3) bottleneck of assessment with current RT-PCR techniques.

Here we propose a new sensor system that relies on embedded contact-free sensors and sensitive RNA detection and amplification in a low-cost, passive (no onboard power) solution that allows for the user to collect sample and safely carry or mail to a local scanner. In this work we will design genetic switches sensitive to COVID-19 RNA (aim 1), implement these switches on paper substrates with cell free protein production (aim 2), and integrate them with a resonant sensor RF transducer (aim 3).

In contrast to other viruses such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, COVID-19 differs in a number of ways, including uncertainties in response to weather conditions, history of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of responses from public health officials or from the general public. An important aspect is to integrate multi-source data such as official reports, atmospheric variables, and social media data into operational biosurveillance and real-time prediction of COVID-19. The proposed biosurveillance framework will be used to forecast COVID-19 dynamics and to enhance mitigation strategies. In addition, it could also be applicable to tracking many other infectious diseases, thereby contributing to security of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the project will build innovative connections within and across mathematical biology, statistics, and deep learning, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary graduate research training.<br/><br/>As the main forecasting framework, the widely used Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamic models can accurately describe the disease dynamics, but only with precise knowledge of disease parameters, which can take a long time to accurately estimate. Deep learning algorithms can potentially have superior predictive ability, but they require extensive training. Another key challenge in the statistical modeling of these events is how to timely and systematically integrate multiple sources of surveillance, anecdotal, and other health-related information under uncertainty. The proposed new predictive approach is based on the interaction between multiple data sources, dynamical SEIR models, and deep learning algorithms. The key idea is to view simulation SEIR models as ?surrogate? pre-trainers for the deep learning models, resulting in less real data needed to retrain the predictive model to reflect ?real world? COVID-19 progression. Deep learning predictive models can then be used for making predictions about the future COVID-19 dynamics, which can be compared to the predictions made by the original SEIR model. Depending on which mathematical model makes better predictions, another model can be updated with the better prediction as inputs, thereby representing reinforcement learning from both data and the best mathematical model. As a result, the new predictive framework will allow one to assess impacts of the immediate responses such as declaration of a national emergency, a school closing, or a quarantine, and can be considered as a step toward interpretable AI for COVID-19 biosurveillance.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This surge has exposed gaps in the established supply chains for procurement of such equipment, leading medical facilities, particularly those that lack the scale to buy equipment in large quantities, to face shortages. In response, small-scale suppliers have emerged that can redirect idle design and manufacturing capacity for non-essential equipment to production of critical medical equipment.  In collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Makerspace, the PIs have created an online platform that has enabled this fragmented and inherently temporary supply chain to efficiently match small-scale suppliers with hospitals in need of supplies.  This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project supports valuable data collection efforts about participating manufacturers, medical facilities, and overall system performance of the online matching platform.  These data will improve understanding of the role that pop-up supply chains can play in addressing supply shortages during pandemics and other nationwide emergencies.<br/><br/>The online platform is driven by an optimization algorithm that efficiently matches buyers with sellers by order size, price, lead time, etc. The PIs will collect and archive data from the platform on manufacturer characteristics (size, capacity, lead times, location, etc.), medical facility characteristics (size, type, requirements, urgency, etc.), and match logistics available through the platform, and will perform follow-up surveys to gather information on impact of the matching system and the effects on business operations.  These data will be used to understand performance of the matching platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, identify factors that influence whether a recommended match leads to a successful transaction, understand the impact of quality variability on pop-up supply chain performance, and study the impact of improving the optimization algorithm on supply chain performance.

HPN-SSH will support and enhance research efforts across a wide range of scientific domains by lowering the costs of entry to big data and remote computation without compromising security or functionality. These benefits will extend to business and industry, educational communities, and the general public as well. <br/><br/>The transfer of large data sets between computing resources is an integral component of the scientific workflow. Multiple tools have been developed to aid in this task but, despite significant performance bottlenecks,  SSH based tools remain popular due to ubiquity, ease of use, and minimal associated costs. To address these bottlenecks we developed HPN-SSH; a series of patches that enable high performance throughput for the OpenSSH application. These patches were initially released in 2004 and have become widely used throughout the research, academic, financial, and technology communities. This award gives the PIs opportunity to foster innovative development in HPN-SSH that will benefit the community by significantly increasing performance. With this grant the PIs will: incorporate on-die hardware accelerated encryption in their multithreaded AES counter cipher; efficiently use multicore CPUs by dynamically sizing the number of threads; introduce pipelining and parallelization into the cryptographic workflow; investigate the parallelization of the default OpenSSH cipher CHACHA20; create a ?resume on failure? feature enabling users to restart transfers from the point of failure; and incorporate inline network telemetry to aid in troubleshooting and performance analysis. This work will also advance the field of computer science through the development and improvement of parallelization methods to enhance the performance of cryptographic routines. As most widely used cryptographic libraries and methods are highly serial in nature they are unable to take advantage of multicore processors. As processor speed has remained relatively stable over the past ten years we must distribute the cryptographic workload over multiple cores in order to significantly increase throughput. HPN-SSH will democratize access and extend the reach of the national cyberinfrastructure by lowering the costs of entry without compromising security or functionality. These benefits will extend to business and industry, educational communities, and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As conventional surgical blood flow monitoring systems are bulky and expensive, the approach taken in this project allows for a compact and affordable device with the potential to serve surgeons and patients alike. The proposed system will increase the use of blood flow monitoring devices for use in reconstructive plastic surgery, with potential to spread to other applications, such as bedsores monitoring and/or field applications prevalent in military medicine. The proposed technology may result in fewer follow-up, corrective surgeries presently caused by delayed diagnosis of sufficient blood flow during surgery. The broader societal impact and commercial benefit, through cost savings and productivity gains within hospitals, will benefit patients and improve the quality and throughput of the medical system. <br/><br/>The proposed project addresses a primary compromise in reconstructive plastic surgery by reducing the uncertainty of surgeons that surgically reconstructed tissue flaps have adequate blood flow both during both the operation itself and post-op patient recovery. This reduces hospitals' costs by decreasing the number of unreimbursed follow-up, corrective surgical procedures required to correct flaps experiencing inadequate blood flow. The research objectives are to: improve depth of imaging and related quality of information to the surgeon or post-op patient support nurse; improve imaging system stabilization, enabling better surgical decision-making; and develop a user interface informed by market discovery with end users (reconstructive surgeons), with the ultimate goal of producing an improved prototype portable perfusion monitor to enable testing and progress towards commercialization. The methods to accomplish these goals include implementation of imaging system stabilization strategies, increased depth-of-imaging to see deeper (sub-surface) blood vessels and flow in tissue, and development of a user interface informed by customer discovery which provides surgeons with surgical site blood flow information in their preferred format.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The models will also provide a means to test the impact of social distancing and mobility reduction on the future course of the pandemic. The proposed modeling framework relies on a two-component structure that does not require prior knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. This approach is especially useful during the initial stages of an emerging outbreak, where little is known and validated about the contagion. Moreover, this project will bring a novel perspective on the mathematical modeling of disease spread, which will complement other ongoing efforts and provide access to diverse models critical to decision-making under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This project builds upon a data-driven mathematical modeling approach leveraging a surprisingly simple behavior examined in epidemiological data sets and models that allows forecasts for case counts with no parameter estimations. The first thrust is to integrate data-driven modeling into explicit network interactions in order to investigate spatial aspects of COVID-19 outbreak propagation. The second thrust of the project is to implement a calibration layer that takes into account mitigation efforts. The rationale for this approach is that, in a constantly evolving environment, epidemiological predictions are difficult to make due to the performativity effect, whereby model predictions affect social behavior and mitigation efforts, which in turn alters the spread of the outbreak predicted by the mathematical models. From a conceptual point of view, this project will address performativity in the context of epidemiological modeling. At the practical level, it will develop a general calibration module that will learn how to incorporate reactions to predictions into epidemiological forecasts. By design, this ?performativity-aware? calibration module will be independent of any specific epidemic model; hence, once  developed, it will be possible to be integrated  into other existing predictive models.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elucidation of the detailed synaptic organization of specific neural circuits is a necessary component for achieving this goal. Progress in this area of neuroscience has been limited by a lack of tools that can simultaneously reveal multiple cell types with distinct molecular and physiological properties within the same brain areas, as well as highlighting in detail how these cells are connected to each other. This project utilizes a novel molecular-biological strategy for defining multiple cell types and their interconnections in mouse brains, enabling investigators to mark individual cells that express combinations of engineered genetic elements. This technique is combined with an existing method that inserts two incomplete parts of a fluorescent molecule onto the surfaces of different nerve cells. If those cells communicate by forming a connection (synapse) with each other, the fragments of the fluorescent molecule come into close enough contact to become functional again, and synapses are identifiable as colored dots of fluorescent light. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the development and optimization of these tools, and the genetic constructs will be distributed via a non-profit agency; all protocols and sequence information will be made widely available through the PI's website. These new tools will greatly enhance the speed and precision with which neuroscientists can study the detailed organization of brain circuitry, and the synaptic connections made onto specific neurons. <br/><br/>This project introduces novel molecular and viral strategies for defining multiple cell types and their synaptic organization. It is based on a novel viral strategy to achieve the intersectional expression of transgenes among specific neuronal populations in transgenic mouse lines that express Cre, flippase (FLP), and other recombinases. A novel site-specific recombinase system (phiC31 and a phiC31-dependent single inverted open reading frame [pSIO]) is used to acheive virus-mediated, specific-transgene expression without cross-reactivity to other recombinases, both in vitro and in vivo. This phiC31/pSIO recombinase system is then combined with ""enhanced Green fluorescent protein Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners"" (eGRASP) to label synaptic contacts made by specific inputs. By providing a novel experimental framework for identifying the cellular constituents of local neural circuits and examining the synaptic organization of multiple presynaptic inputs onto specific neurons, and by optimizing these tools for general use and making them freely available to the scientific community, this project is expected to accelerate discovery about the organizational and functional properties of neural circuitry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At this time, the pandemic is being driven by person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The U.S. government, both state and federal, responded to the pandemic by launching social distancing as an intervention, ordering schools and non-essential businesses to close throughout most of the country. Mathematical models are required in order to measure the transmission of COVID-19 in the U.S. This research focuses on building mathematical models that include data on social distancing to measure how effective the intervention is at slowing the disease. The researchers will also evaluate strategies for reopening schools and workplaces. Importantly, the researchers will measure the risk for a second pandemic wave by accounting for how the immune system reacts to the infection. This research is important because it will provide the U.S. government with models that it can use to choose among options for reopening cities. These models will also reveal the number of deaths averted by social distancing policies. In addition to the great societal benefit of this research, it also brings scientific advancement and broader impacts by demonstrating how novel datasets can be collected in real-time and models can be deployed during a public health emergency. This project provides professional development opportunities for an early career scientist. <br/><br/>Transmission models will be used to explore creative ways for phased reopening of cities in order to minimize disease-induced mortality and overburdening of hospitals. The researchers will focus on the 62 counties in New York state, the current epicenter of the pandemic. The researchers will fit a city-level COVID-19 transmission model which accounts for social distancing quantified by Google traffic data, and ground-truthed by public transportation data, live-webcam streams, and Google trends indicating individuals are staying home. The researchers will explore transmission dynamics and hospitalization trajectories under different scenarios of adaptive immunity (e.g., long-lived sterilizing immunity, waning immunity, and immunity that reduces symptoms in subsequent infections). Models will be parameterized using data on testing, COVID-19 clinical cases, hospitalizations, and mortality via Maximum Likelihood by Iterated Particle Filtering (MIF).

Our society uses algorithms to solve problems ranging from making investment decisions in personal financial planning, to allocating resources in large-scale computing systems such as data centers. Often, these problems are difficult because of uncertainty about the future. In algorithmic theory, traditionally conservative approaches are used which provide relatively weak but highly robust guarantees that hold no matter how the future unfolds. In practice, a more promising alternative is the use of machine-learning techniques to make algorithmic choices for the future based on knowledge of past data. By implicitly assuming that the future will mirror the past, one can provide stronger guarantees and better empirical performance. However, the ""worst-case"" robustness of the previous approach is not available, which is important if the implicit assumption of 'past predicts the future' no longer holds true. This project seeks to combine the two approaches and get the best of both worlds by exploring the interface between algorithm design and machine learning. The end goal is a comprehensive toolbox for algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty that is both robust and has good performance. In addition to this research component, the project will train graduate and undergraduate researchers in theoretical computer science, with an emphasis on participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigators' approach is to rethink each of these individual toolboxes to take advantage of the other -- namely incorporating machine-learned advice in algorithm design, and conversely, training machine learning models for algorithmic objectives. The main intellectual thrust of this project is to use machine-learned predictions to improve the quality of algorithms, and conversely, to design learning models that can be specifically trained for optimization objectives. This will be explored in two main directions: the first part considers Machine Learning as a Black Box. Here, the optimization algorithm merely consumes the predictions from the learning model. This is often the case in practice, particularly when the predictions are generated by complex systems such as deep neural networks. In this case, the focus will be on ensuring that we do not over-fit the predictions, on deciding what input parameters to predict in the first place, and on choosing between multiple alternative prediction models based on their relative accuracy, reliability, and costs. In the second part (Machine Learning as a White Box), the focus is on a more integrated design, where the optimization algorithm interacts with the learning model at runtime and ask adaptives queries. More ambitiously, the project explores a significant redesign of the end-to-end system, including the learning models and the optimization algorithms, for specific optimization tasks. This work will rely on techniques from online algorithms, stochastic and robust optimization, and learning theory, and build connections between these fields to address the central questions of algorithmic decision making under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also facilitates the prediction of where hydrocarbon, water, mineral, and geothermal resources are buried in sedimentary basins. This project aims to advance our understanding of how sediment is transferred through the beds, bars, and levees of rivers in order to help i) answer questions about river response to changes in tectonics, climate, and sea level, ii) understand controls on river movements on Earth and other planets, and iii) predict the best places for underground energy development, mineral exploration and aquifer management. This project is providing training opportunities for students from underrepresented groups, thereby helping to develop a diverse geoscience workforce. This research is also producing large datasets?made available via data repositories? of experimental bedform characteristics and scaled stratigraphic measurements that will be a valuable teaching resource, and useful for geologists, geomorphologists, and civil engineers alike. In addition, the researchers are developing mini-tutorials and virtual field trips that can be used as classroom exercises for students and outcrop-interpretation exercises for scientists, including those with limited access to field experiences. Images and image interpretations are being incorporated into the machine learning project to support the development of automated outcrop interpretation tools.<br/>   <br/>This project is leveraging advances in geomorphology and sedimentary geology to quantitatively connect the role of sediment supply in sediment-transport processes across multiple scales to stratigraphic products. A combination of physical experiments, modeling, and field observations is being used to refine physical constraints on sediment transport rates of bedforms, bars, and channels, and to quantify how the shape and preservation of these features in the stratigraphic record relate to sediment-flux conditions at different scales. This insight is being applied to deposits of the Spanish Pyrenees ? a system with robust basin-scale sediment-flux constraints ? as a field calibration exercise. Subsequently, the developed approaches can help quantitatively test hypotheses about sediment-supply changes that occurred in response to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum climate-change event. These efforts are yielding new insight into how sediment is partitioned between distinct but interrelated morphodynamic processes in fluvial landscapes, and providing a guide to how environmental and land-use change can affect river mobility on centennial to millennial timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to other viruses such as influenza, SARS, and MERS,  COVID-19 differs in a number of ways, including uncertainties in response to weather conditions, history of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of responses from public health officials or from the general public. An important aspect is to integrate multi-source data such as official reports, atmospheric variables, and social media data into operational biosurveillance and real-time prediction of COVID-19. The proposed biosurveillance framework will be used to forecast COVID-19 dynamics and to enhance mitigation strategies. In addition, it could also be applicable to tracking many other infectious diseases, thereby contributing to security of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the project will build innovative connections within and across mathematical biology, statistics, and deep learning, with a strong focus on interdisciplinary graduate research training.<br/><br/>As the main forecasting framework, the widely used Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamic models can accurately describe the disease dynamics, but only with precise knowledge of disease parameters, which can take a long time to accurately estimate. Deep learning algorithms can potentially have superior predictive ability, but they require extensive training.  Another key challenge in the statistical modeling of these events is how to timely and systematically integrate multiple sources of surveillance, anecdotal, and other health-related information under uncertainty. The proposed new predictive approach is based on the interaction between multiple data sources, dynamical SEIR models, and deep learning algorithms. The key idea is to view simulation SEIR models as ?surrogate? pre-trainers for the deep learning models, resulting in less real data needed to retrain the predictive model to reflect ?real world? COVID-19 progression. Deep learning predictive models can then be used for making predictions about the future COVID-19 dynamics, which can be compared to the predictions made by the original SEIR model. Depending on which mathematical model makes better predictions, another model can be updated with the better prediction as inputs, thereby representing reinforcement learning from both data and the best mathematical model. As a result, the new predictive framework will allow one to assess impacts of the immediate responses such as declaration of a national emergency, a school closing, or a quarantine, and can be considered as a step toward interpretable AI for COVID-19 biosurveillance.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the challenges is to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The goal of this project is to design simple techniques to make protective materials that prevent virus transmission. To achieve this goal, virus particles will be designed to make virus research easier and safer. Materials that will be tested will be coated with readily available plant proteins to prevent virus transmission. These materials will include those used for masks, air conditioning filters, and work surfaces. The plant proteins are also easy to attach to surfaces such as cotton and other natural and synthetic fibers by simply immersing these materials in protein solutions. Models of COVID-19 will be created in two different methods: (1) a virus that normally infects bacteria will be  modified  to produce the ?spike? of  SARS-CoV2 on its surface; (2)The spike protein will be inserted into synthetic lipid membrane droplets similar to those coating SARS-CoV2. These two non-pathogenic model viruses will allow widespread research into coronavirus and other emerging viruses without the need for highly protective specialized equipment. Successful completion of this research will inform efforts to protect the public and potentially lead to new effective nature-based protective measures against the spread of SARS-CoV2 and other similarly structured viruses.<br/><br/>SARS-CoV2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is a lipid enveloped virus with protruding spike proteins. The structure of the spike protein was recently determined by researchers at the University of Texas. The goal of this proposed research is to evaluate the ability of surfaces functionalized with specific plant-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to bind this spike protein. These AMPs include two proteins obtained from aqueous extracts of the Moringa oleifera seed (MO): a chitin binding protein (MoCBP) and a cationic protein (MO2.1). The central hypotheses of the proposed work are: (i) specific binding of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain using MoCBP-functionalized surfaces can be used as an effective removal technique, and (ii) MO2.1 on functionalized surfaces will inactivate SARS-CoV2 by damaging the lipid envelope of the virus. Recent simulation and experimental results demonstrate strong interactions of MoCBP with the purified spike protein from SARS-CoV2. To facilitate this research, we will develop a non-pathogenic model of SARS-CoV2 for rapid experimentation without the need for specialized safety equipment. The following tasks will be performed to test hypotheses and achieve the goal of this research: 1) test virus removal efficiency of MO-coated cotton from water and air by using filtration experiments with  SARS-CoV2  spike protein and modified T7 bacteriophages displaying the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV2 as surrogates; 2) test the interaction of MO2.1 with the lipid membrane of SARS-CoV2 by using virus-like lipid particles amended with spike protein as virus surrogates to establish removal/inactivation; and 3) test the effectiveness of easily accessible surgical masks and HVAC filters coated with MO proteins in immobilizing SARS-CoV2. Successful completion of this research has great potential to lead to the development of effective technology for removal and protection against SARS-CoV2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate students, who routinely congregate on campuses for classes and other activities, have an elevated risk of exposure to respiratory infections.  However, as a generally younger adult population, they also have a relatively low risk of progressing to COVID-19.  As a result, it is possible that students could be carriers of this virus, posing increased risk of spreading it to others.  This RAPID project will expand the scope of an existing Classroom-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in microbiology at the University of Houston ? Clear Lake.  Students currently enrolled in the CURE participate in authentic research in a course-based setting to study the nasal microbiome.  Support provided by this award will enable students to add information about their SARS-CoV-2 status to the research.  The CURE will allow them to learn both how research is conducted and to potentially generate new knowledge about how the SARS-CoV-2 virus works.  Students will also develop and use a virtual reality tool to learn how to use MALDI-TOF to sequence DNA fragments, providing them with skills that are valuable in clinical and research laboratories.  <br/><br/>The students enrolled in the CURE have already collected their own nasal swab specimens earlier in the Spring 2020 semester.  These specimens were cultured to select for bacteria in the Staphylococus genus.  Working at home, students will participate in remote data collection from high-throughput MALDI-TOF analysis of PCR amplicons generated from the 16S rRNA gene with bacterial-domain specific primers. These data will identify which bacterial isolates are Stapthlococcus epidermis.  In addition, volunteers from this group of students will be invited to return campus to provide nasal swab samples to be tested for the presence of SARS-Cov-2.  A drive-through testing facility that requires students to remain in their vehicles at all times will be used for this purpose.  At the facility, registered nurses will survey the students about possible CoVID-19 symptoms.  Following FDA guidelines, students will then self-swab, place the swab into a tube containing reagents that inactivate viruses, then place the tube into a secondary container.  Thus, only the individual student handles their sample. Co-PI Alexander will collect all of the secondary containers, place them into a third container, and deliver it to a commercial lab to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, using research-only test kits that cannot be used clinically.  Students will receive their SARS-CoV-2 status via a blinded protocol that ensures that only the individual student will know their status.  The deidentified data from the class will be pooled to examine the relationship between the nasal microbiome and the presence of SARS-CoV-2.  Exploring the potential of S. epidermis to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection might provide greater understanding of the virulence of SARS-CoV-2.  Thus, there is a urgent need for immediate data collection.  In parallel with data collection and analysis, the project intends to develop virtual modules for teaching MALDI-TOF, providing students with training opportunities that would be otherwise unavailable due to campus closure.

Likewise, the importance of wake is axiomatic: reproduction, feeding, and escape from predation depend on an animal being awake. However, until recently, the neural circuits that regulate wake and sleep have remained poorly understood. One strand of inquiry has implicated a non-neuronal cell type in sleep-wake control. This cell?the astrocyte?makes up the largest class of non-neuronal cells in the brain, and it has been shown to affect the activity of surrounding neurons. However, the ways in which astrocytes are involved in sleep and wake are largely unexplored. This project tests whether astrocytes sense wake-specific signals and respond to these signals by changing the state of the brain. To perform these experiments, advanced imaging tools to watch different forms of cellular activity in the brain are used. The broader impacts of this project aim to make interdisciplinary research accessible and routine to trainees early in their careers. The motivation for this lies in the fact that trainees with experience in physical sciences are more likely to become tool builders themselves, and that watching science happening in real time can excite and empower trainees to think deeply about the biology around them.<br/><br/>Neuromodulatory signaling is critical for animal behavior, in part by shifting the brain among various states, and the most dramatic brain state shifts are arguably those that occur between wake and sleep. However, how neuromodulatory inputs arising in subcortical nuclei are integrated at the level of the cortex to regulate population-level state shifts remains unclear. Several neuromodulatory receptors are expressed on both cortical neurons and astrocytes, raising the possibility that astrocytes are partners with neurons in sensing neuromodulatory cues to initiate and/or maintain wake in the cortex. Astrocytes are an attractive target for coordinating large-scale neuronal circuit changes, and they have also been implicated in sleep/wake via brain state-dependent changes in extracellular balance and morphology. The overarching hypothesis for this project is that neuromodulatory signaling to astrocytes, and subsequent astrocytic effects on population neuronal activity, is critical for integrating wake-state signals in the cortex, the largest area of the mammalian brain. The research addresses these questions using advanced two-photon imaging, modern neurobiological tools to modulate neural activity, and astrocyte-specific technology to probe the cell biological responses of astrocytes to neuromodulatory cues, and map astrocytic dynamics across wake and sleep, in preparation to test the effects of astrocyte activation on wake state and neural signaling in a cortical circuit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pandemic of COVID-19 has raised a significant public health concern in 2020. The spread of COVID-19 is difficult to control, because SARS-CoV-2 is environmentally persistent and it can potentially be suspended in aerosols for long-range, airborne transmission and infection. Air filtration is crucial to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, however most air filters used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings are not effective for retaining viruses. As personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel or even the general public, respirators and masks that can effectively capture the virus are also urgently needed for this pandemic. Electrospinning has emerged as a novel technology to synthesize non-woven nanofibrous mats, and it is both industrially viable for large-scale manufacturing and deployable onsite for small-scale applications by a portable device. The fabricated nanofibrous mats are ideal for air filtration, because they have a reduced pore size to efficiently capture the virus, a large porosity to reduce air pressure drop in filtration, well-controlled properties, and mechanical robustness and flexibility. This RAPID research project will rationally design and fabricate novel nanomaterial-based air filters for coronavirus control, understand the interplay between viral pathogens and nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices, and initiate a fast response for protecting the public health with engineering tools. The project will provide training to students in science and engineering areas and offer them hands-on research experience, and introduce students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to cutting-edge research in STEM. In addition, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge through education modules, scientific journals and conferences, and science fairs, which will help increase the scientific literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>The research team aims to rationally design and fabricate electrospun nanofibrous air filters that are effective, low-cost, scalable, and easy for implementation for coronavirus control, including SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the mechanism of coronavirus removal in air filtration. The researchers will first develop electrospun nanofibrous air filters with diverse morphologies, retained charges, and selective binding sites to enhance the capture of bioaerosols containing coronavirus. Coronavirus removal efficiency under different environmental conditions will next be evaluated to understand the performance and robustness of the air filters. Key virus-nanomaterial interactions will be identified with the aid of both simulation and experimental tools, which can guide future air filter design and optimization. For this RAPID project, the researchers will also test the performance of air filters for removing SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility that houses COVID-19 patients. The proposed research will contribute significantly to nanotechnology, microbiology, and environmental engineering, and it can be potentially transformative in the field of materials at large in terms of multiscale, rational, functional design. It will not only provide a rapid response to COVID-19 outbreaks and public health protection, but also be translated into controlling other virulent pathogens.

Similarly, huge amounts of news articles are generated and disseminated about the pandemic to keep the population informed. The appropriateness of the actions taken by individuals, corporations, and governments are often based on the quality of data and news. Thus, ensuring the quality of data and news is important. However, malicious actors can alter the attributes of data records, insert spurious records, or suppress records causing any analysis to be inadequate and misinformation to be propagated. This project addresses the critical problem of defining and identifying spurious data and news concerning COVID-19, and tracking the source of misinformation. The project novelty lies in the development of an approach and associated toolset that adapts and combines Machine Learning technologies to detect spurious data and misinformation and presents the results in a manner that is easy for end users to understand and interpret. The approach detects discrepancies in COVID-19 data and traces the flagged discrepancies back to the data sources. The results obtained from the news sources and those obtained from the medical data analysis are compared to determine correlations between the quality of news and the degree and type of data manipulation performed at any region. The project?s impacts are on significantly enhancing the ability to perform accurate scientific analysis, and detecting and explaining news manipulation with respect to COVID-19. The scientific principles developed in the project are expected to be useful outside the medical domain. The PI and the students identified for this project are minorities. The project will be carried out in the Computer Science Department at Colorado State University which is a BRAID affiliate.<br/><br/>COVID-19 data discrepancies are related to (1) single records, where some field is modified, (2) sequence of records over time forming a temporal dimension, where spurious records have been inserted or records have been suppressed, and (3) sequences of records across regions forming a spatial dimension, where there is a pattern of manipulation or information disclosure across regions. The approach determines the appropriate combination of autoencoders, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Temporal Convolution Network (TCNs), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) that can work with data obtained from medical sources and news containing both spatial and temporal dimensions. The tools help the investigators? collaborators at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Center and Center for Disease Control and Prevention to perform data integrity checking of medical records and to provide explanations of integrity violations.

While virus transmission occurs via tiny aerosols, current mask coverings rely purely on passive filters; and can benefit from enhanced aerosol-collection and virus-inactivation mechanisms. We propose to engineer a highly-efficient, easy-to-use, cost-effective respirator design that will be significantly more efficient at capturing tiny aerosols. A combination of copper-based filters and an air-transmission passage inspired by nasal structures in animals with an enhanced sense of smell will facilitate droplet capture, followed by virus inactivation via thermal and ionic effects. The final respirator design will directly address the urgent global shortage and immediate national need for more effective masks. By preventing nosocomial transmission, the product can also be a critical game-changer for the healthcare community. For an accelerated concept-to-product transition, we will seek collaborations with virology labs and pharmaceutical companies for detailed testing with live COVID samples.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will engineer a novel, highly-efficient, virus-preventive respirator mask inspired by nasal structures in animals with enhanced olfactory sensitivity. Small aerosol droplets that can carry viruses will be captured from inhaled air by using a combination of copper-based filters and a bio-inspired tortuous passage with periodic thermal gradients induced by spiral copper wires. The aerosol capture will be articulated by modulating the dynamics of flow structures in the convoluted geometry (vortex trap) and by thermophoresis action along the respirator?s internal walls (thermal trap). Cyclic cold/hot temperature changes on the walls, along with ionic activity from the copper material, will be used to inactivate the trapped viruses. The use of these mechanisms is supported by published observations on earlier and current strains of coronavirus. The project will integrate the theoretical, experimental, and computational expertise of the principal investigators in optimizing the design for a new-age respirator, which can be radically more effective at preventing the transmission of COVID-19. To meet the urgent public need, the researchers will establish collaborations with pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies as well as university-based Biosafety Level ? 3 lab units for non-clinical in vivo testing and to ensure rapid prototype development of the proposed respirator masks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This results in inefficient decision-making among the poor in countries around the world.  For example, the poor frequently do not take advantage of  poverty-reducing programs and services in both developing and developed countries. This study explores whether these cognitive constraints explain inefficient economic decisions and behaviors observed among the poor. This research project focuses on informal workers in urban areas whose incomes fluctuate substantially in the short-term, in ways that are both  expected and unexpected. The experiment involves giving some entrepreneurs in the informal sector (treated group) unexpected increased income through large unexpected purchases and offer them tasks that involve business decision making.  By comparing decision-making ability of the treated with those of not treated, the researchers will be able to draw policy implications from the experiment. This research will indicate the potential demand for such policy design solutions as nudging reminders, default enrolment, and timing application of procedures to coincide with periods of higher cognition.  The results of this research will help develop policies to improve decision making of people with cognitive constraints, hence increase the take-up rate of poverty reducing programs among the poor.  This will help establish the US as the global leader in poverty reduction research.<br/><br/>To understand the relationship between income and economic decision-making, this research project will conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment in an urban informal markets.

Following these income shocks, the PIs then measure economic decision-making using an incentivized, menu choice game that assesses consistency of decision-making ability and assess real-life economic decision-making by providing traders with information about an opportunity to receive free mobile credit. Finally, the PIs will measure attention and working memory to assess the cognitive mechanism.

The research supported through this RAPID award will enhance knowledge of how this virus evolves, and it may provide vital clues about its interactions with the human host. Previous research has shown that a critical region of the viral genome is highly conserved, harboring very few mutations compared to the rest of the genome.

Until recently, Moore?s Law guided the exponential growth of hardware resources under the same cost and has been a key driving factor behind cyberinfrastructure performance growth. As the growth predicted by Moore?s Law slows down, sustaining performance gains requires cyberinfrastructure to maximize the utilization of its available hardware resources, especially computing memory. Currently, cyberinfrastructure systems often only utilize up to a small fraction of their memory compared to what is physically and/or theoretically possible. As memory primarily serves as a performance enhancer, memory under-utilization causes under-performance and unnecessary investment in additional computing resources. This project seems to address this problem by identifying ways to better use memory resources in supercomputers and cloud computing systems, thereby increasing the efficiency and performance of these systems. The project, MemMax, actively involves both graduate and undergraduate students, along with outreach to K-12 students.<br/><br/>MemMaX explores how to co-design CPU and OS to maximize memory utilization in cyberinfrastructure systems to boost their performance both user-transparently and substantially by a factor of up to 4. MemMax consists of two research thrusts, one targeting HPC systems and targeting cloud systems, as these two types of systems have different causes for their memory underutilization. The research methodology consists of real-system measurements to characterize the behavior of existing systems, hardware prototyping to valid the functional correctness of MemMax, and architectural simulations to quantify the performance improvement MemMax achieves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laboratory tests, often based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), require equipment, time, expertise and infrastructure, resulting in severe logistical challenges and ultimately resulting in inadequate testing. There is a critical need for diagnostics that can be rapidly deployed at the point-of-need (PON) to enable global surveillance of infectious diseases. Towards addressing this need, this project incorporates a new CRISPR-based approach called CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) that enables one-pot diagnostic amplification and detection of the SARC-CoV-2 virus at ambient temperatures. This scheme builds off innovations in cell-free synthetic biology and biosensing that enable rapid, low-cost, and PON detection of chemical contaminants and viral pathogens. The platform technology under development could serve several purposes from a quick-screen technology to inform triage and isolation strategies, to a clinical test used on the front lines. There is also the potential for the technology to eventually serve as an at-home test to help inform which subpopulations and sectors of the economy could safely return to productivity towards the end of the pandemic. In addition, the test has the flexibility to be rapidly reprogrammed to detect new emerging pathogens. This work is pursued in close collaboration with a commercial partner, Stemloop, Inc., in order to quickly transition the technology for manufacturing, deployment, and distribution.<br/><br/>This project employs a new CRISPR Isothermal Amplification (CIA) approach to enable a one-pot amplification and detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in an assay for the virus. CIA uses programmed Cas 13 systems to recognize SARS-CoV-2 RNA, trigger nucleic acid amplification and create a detectable output simultaneously in the same reaction where amplification occurs. Computational models of each process are developed alongside the experimental systems and used to guide optimizations to achieve attomolar sensitivity.  The method is unique in that no DNA primers are required. The amplification and detection processes are designed to take less than one hour and cost less than one dollar per test to manufacture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology may enable faster and higher power computing, especially for supercomputers conducting high demand processes, such as training artificial intelligence systems. The research objective is to demonstrate a performance benefit resulting from the optimization of the printing process, mechanical bonding/reliability, and the heat sink design.

Anthropogenic deforestation is frequently associated with increases in wildlife disease. These patterns are expected to stem from both landscape-scale processes, such as changes in animal movement and disease transmission, and fine-scale processes, such as changes in the community of microbes that inhabit animal tissues (collectively termed the microbiome), but the interplay between these multi-scale processes is unresolved. This project investigates the relationship between deforestation and the microbiome to explain patterns of disease emergence across a range of disturbed environments, using amphibians of Brazil?s Atlantic Forest as a model system. Work here stands apart from previous studies by integrating landscape-scale and microbe-scale processes into a unified framework that will advance microbial, disease, and global change ecology. This project implements a diversity recruitment program for graduate students with support from the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program at the University of Alabama and other funding sources at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. In partnership with the Alabama Museum of Natural History, portable mini exhibits and school activities w will be manufactured and implemented to narrow the K-12 science education gap in one of the most underserved areas in the nation. It is predicted that these exhibits will reach 66,000 students annually in five county school districts in Alabama.<br/><br/>The diverse assemblages of microbes that inhabit vertebrate hosts, collectively termed the microbiome, are vital to animal health. However, links between the host microbiome and emerging wildlife diseases are rarely considered within a landscape ecology framework. Repeated exposure to pathogens may alter community dynamics within the host microbiome and can promote competitive microbial interactions and host responses that may enrich the microbiome with anti-pathogen members. This form of acquired pathogen resistance, termed microbiome memory, may facilitate host recovery and prime the host after subsequent pathogen exposures. Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation notoriously restricts host movement at the landscape scale, which may alter rates of pathogen exposure that are critical for establishing microbiome memory prior to seasonal increases in pathogen pressure. This project will investigate interactive effects of anthropogenic habitat disturbance and host microbiome dynamics as a mechanism to explain observed increases in disease risk in fragmented landscapes, using amphibians of Brazil?s Atlantic Forest as a model system. The selection acting on amphibian skin microbiomes in a survey of three amphibian species with seasonal pathogen dynamics across a gradient of landscape fragmentation will be examined. Also, field experiments will be conducted using microbiome manipulation, host translocation, and radio telemetry to test for mechanisms linking habitat fragmentation, disease, and the host microbiome independently from other components of host immunity. This work will generate a robust dataset integrating landscape ecology with a metacommunity theory of adaptive microbiomes, with novel implications for host resistance to disease and the maintenance and stability of biological diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Equally important is the need to determine the potential effects of early interventions such as school closures and mandatory or self-imposed quarantines. To answer these questions, this project will develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing the ongoing outbreak trends using data solely from partially observed new daily infection counts (also known as the epidemic curve). The PI?s new framework will not assume any specific infectious or recovery periods (which are often unknown) or observable prevalence of the disease. The tools developed as part of this project will both help predict the rate of growth of new infections and estimate the effect of social distancing and other preventative measures on flattening the epidemic curve. The PI will use a new dynamical survival analysis approach to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic for a mid-western region of the United States. Data from elsewhere in the world, like the city of Wuhan in China, will be used to calibrate the predictions. The project will also provide a practical interdisciplinary training for a PhD student and a post-doctoral fellow.<br/><br/>The modeling and predictive framework to be developed is fundamentally different from the traditional approach based on the incidence or prevalence counts in a compartmental SIR model. Specifically, the PI will apply the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) approach that considers aggregated mean field equations for the underlying large stochastic network and regards them as the approximate survival law of the infection times. The PI will use these DSA-based equations to model both the epidemic and recovery curves and compare them with the ones observed during the COVID-19 outbreak. The statistical analysis of epidemic data performed with the help of the new framework will allow the quick elucidation of the dynamics of an epidemic (for example, the basic reproduction number, R0) and the potential impact of interventions (such as quarantine or social distancing). The new framework will help provide a better understanding of how preventive behaviors affect COVID-19 dynamics via changes in the network structure and changes in disease transmission across edges in the network. This project will develop a user-friendly software package for computer simulations under different parameter and intervention scenarios (for example, vaccination schemes) that will lead to a better understanding of how to control COVID-19 transmission.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pandemic of COVID-19 has raised a significant public health concern in 2020. The spread of COVID-19 is difficult to control, because SARS-CoV-2 is environmentally persistent and it can potentially be suspended in aerosols for long-range, airborne transmission and infection. Air filtration is crucial to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission, however most air filters used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings are not effective for retaining viruses. As personal protective equipment for healthcare personnel or even the general public, respirators and masks that can effectively capture the virus are also urgently needed for this pandemic. Electrospinning has emerged as a novel technology to synthesize non-woven nanofibrous mats, and it is both industrially viable for large-scale manufacturing and deployable onsite for small-scale applications by a portable device. The fabricated nanofibrous mats are ideal for air filtration, because they have a reduced pore size to efficiently capture the virus, a large porosity to reduce air pressure drop in filtration, well-controlled properties, and mechanical robustness and flexibility. This RAPID research project will rationally design and fabricate novel nanomaterial-based air filters for coronavirus control, understand the interplay between viral pathogens and nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices, and initiate a fast response for protecting the public health with engineering tools. The project will provide training to students in science and engineering areas and offer them hands-on research experience, and introduce students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to cutting-edge research in STEM. In addition, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge through education modules, scientific journals and conferences, and science fairs, which will help increase the scientific literacy of the general public. <br/><br/>The research team aims to rationally design and fabricate electrospun nanofibrous air filters that are effective, low-cost, scalable, and easy for implementation for coronavirus control, including SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the mechanism of coronavirus removal in air filtration. The researchers will first develop electrospun nanofibrous air filters with diverse morphologies, retained charges, and selective binding sites to enhance the capture of bioaerosols containing coronavirus. Coronavirus removal efficiency under different environmental conditions will next be evaluated to understand the performance and robustness of the air filters. Key virus-nanomaterial interactions will be identified with the aid of both simulation and experimental tools, which can guide future air filter design and optimization. For this RAPID project, the researchers will also test the performance of air filters for removing SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare facility that houses COVID-19 patients. The proposed research will contribute significantly to nanotechnology, microbiology, and environmental engineering, and it can be potentially transformative in the field of materials at large in terms of multiscale, rational, functional design. It will not only provide a rapid response to COVID-19 outbreaks and public health protection, but also be translated into controlling other virulent pathogens. The project will provide training to students in STEM, particularly introduce students from underrepresented groups and students from diverse backgrounds and educational levels to cutting-edge research. Moreover, the project will disseminate the acquired knowledge to help increase the scientific literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It addresses challenges with broadening participation in science by providing equity and access to quality science instruction at Title 1 elementary schools in metro Atlanta, Georgia. Title 1 schools are schools with large concentrations of low-income students that receive supplemental funds to assist in meeting educational goals and educational needs of students living near poverty levels. Opportunities to learn science in elementary school are particularly limited; especially in those schools that serve racially and ethnically diverse children and children suffering from poverty. Interventions aimed at broadening participation have been limited in both impact and scope. This project is addressing this challenge through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a professional development model that will prepare teachers to effectively utilize science education practices grounded in culturally responsive pedagogy. It provides a new science instruction model that intersects the best practices in science education with the theoretical principles of culturally relevant/responsive pedagogy found to influence students from low economic, diverse communities. By focusing on both in-service and preservice teachers, the project will make a valuable contribution to the understanding of teacher education across the trajectory of  educators? careers and deepen an understanding of how to prepare teachers to adopt and effectively utilize effective practices in their everyday classrooms, particularly in relation to science teaching and learning.<br/><br/>The project will involve 30 preservice and 20 in-service teachers participating in a summer academy and workshops introducing them to instructional features of the model that will later be used during instruction with the students. Instruction provided by the teachers will impact approximately 1,420 students. The goal of the project is to design and test an innovative science instruction model that intersects the best practices in science education with the principles of culturally responsive pedagogy. The two-year design and development project incorporate mixed methods to examine the three components of the model hypothesized as critical for improvements in teacher practice: culturally responsive classroom management, discourse, and anchoring.

This project will investigate the adaptation mechanisms of high-pressure and high-temperature bacteria that use hydrogen as an energy source to different pressures and hydrogen concentration regimes. An innovative instrument for bacterial cultures at high pressure and temperature will be used to simulate the deep-sea physical (temperature, pressure) and chemical (hydrogen concentration) conditions. This experimental approach provides a unique opportunity to study microbial activity and functions by adjusting pressure conditions dynamically. Gene expression under different pressures and temperatures will also be monitored. Finally, since hydrogen oxidation is considered an ancient metabolic pathway, understanding hydrogen catabolism in these organisms may help to reconstruct the evolutionary history of early metabolism. The researchers will develop lessons and activities to translate the science for middle and high school aged learners. Lectures and lab demonstrations/tours will be delivered at George Mason University and Rutgers University to undergraduate/graduate students as part of graduate-level seminar series.<br/><br/>Culture-based studies of the physiological and metabolic adaptations of high-pressure adapted bacteria are critical to advance understanding of microbial activity and bioenergetic adaptation strategies in deep-sea ecosystems.

Tests capacities are limited compared to the need, hospital services are becoming overwhelmed, and critical supplies are in shortage. There is a diversity of efforts currently ongoing to develop both new treatments as well as vaccine strategies to combat COVID-19. Yet, we know from experience, the virus will evolve solutions to both host immune systems and intervention strategies. In order to diminish both the short-term and long-term impacts of COVID-19, it is essential to develop robust, repeatable, and accessible tools to integrate and analyze the diversity of data becoming available in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of a platform to characterize the dynamic nature of mutations in the virus and testing for associations with clinical variables and biomarkers is an essential broader impact and will help in making informed predictions of health outcomes such as the stage of the severity of the disease and efficacy of treatment. Additionally, this project provides professional development opportunities for early career researchers.<br/><br/>Advances in omics technologies provide a broad and deep range of genotypic and phenotypic data to integrate with clinical phenotypes. Machine learning techniques such as clustering using phylogenetic distance and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are suitable techniques to link these DNA level changes to clinical metadata for human disease prediction, diagnosis, and therapeutics. This project develops tools within an open-source platform for documented, repeatable analyses that can be conducted in real-time allowing integration of data from patients with new treatments/vaccines strategies. This deep learning bioinformatics platform will allow the prioritization of genes associated with outcome predictors, including health, therapeutic, and vaccine outcomes, as well as inform improved DNA tests for predicting disease status and severity.

This process has the unfortunate side-effect of increasing seismic activity in disposal areas. The ability to remove any hazardous components returned in the wastewater, so that it can be reused in the fracking process or for other purposes such as irrigation, would minimize the detrimental impact of fracking in local communities. Toxic heavy metals, such as selenium and arsenic, are among the hazardous materials found in fracking wastewater. This project will develop a new approach to remove selenium and arsenic from fracking wastewater using nanofiltration (NF) membranes. NF membranes are semi-permeable, meaning certain small molecules or ions (i.e., sodium chloride) pass through the membrane while other components are trapped behind the membrane. NF membranes are susceptible to oil-fouling when treating fracking wastewater, or in other words, oil contaminants remaining in the wastewater collects at the membrane surface until water and small molecules can no longer pass through. Therefore, this project will utilize surface patterns and anti-fouling metal organics frameworks (MOFs) to prevent membrane oil-fouling. MOFs are a class of highly porous crystalline materials formed from metal ions and organic linkers. MOFs are an attractive modifier in membrane synthesis since they can selectively capture dissolved molecules and ions from large volumes of fluid. The effectiveness of this separation arises from the affinity of the MOF for the molecule or ion, the extraordinarily high porosity of the material, and the ability to tune the sorbent properties of the material to the molecule of interest. Engineering surface patterns on the MOF is expected to create localized mixing such that foulant materials are less likely to stick to a membrane surface. The overall research effort aims to enable sustainable treatment schemes for fracking wastewater by removing toxic heavy metals. The proposed research will be carried out by graduate and undergraduate students, who will collaboratively develop research plans, mentor other students, and perform STEM outreach to local K-12 students from underrepresented groups. Additionally, water treatment and membrane design concepts will be incorporated into the research team?s classes to expose undergraduate and graduate students to current topics and challenges in water treatment.<br/><br/>This project aims to mitigate oil-fouling and adsorption capacity reduction using surface patterns and anti-fouling metal-organic frameworks to maintain MOF selectivity for selenium and arsenic while incorporated in an NF membrane to treat fracking wastewater. The investigators hypothesize that surface micro-patterning and anti-fouling graphene oxide (GO)-decorated MOFs will mitigate oil-induced membrane fouling, thereby preventing capacity and selectivity loss of thin-film nanocomposite membranes in produced water service. The approach will examine three different sized micro-patterns and two types of GO-decorated MOFs to tailor anti-fouling ability, selectivity, and permeance. The project will yield fundamental understanding of how pattern size and synthesis procedure affect the MOF capacity, selectivity, and oil-fouling resistance. This project will generate new knowledge on whether GO-decorated MOFs, specifically GO-Cu- and GO-Fe-MOFs, improve anti-fouling performance over non-GO-decorated MOFs. Ultimately, the proposed research is expected to enable sustainable produced water treatment schemes through the removal of toxic heavy metals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, it focuses on how different value and belief systems influence (non-)compliance with containment measures as the pandemic unfolds. In doing so, the research enhances basic understanding of science/policy communications and their impact on public attitudes and behaviors. Ultimately, the project helps identify best science communication practices to inform and educate people about COVID-19 and similar crises. <br/><br/>Policies and scientific recommendations aimed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus have generated critical discussions about the prioritization of collective versus individual values. Tradeoffs often focus on public security and health versus individual autonomy and civil liberties.

By integrating theories from social and cross-cultural psychology, this research explores the role of different value systems, including basic human values, social values, and cultural values, in public responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. A collaborative research network will collect primary data from representative adult samples at three time points during the pandemic. Changes are tracked in public endorsement of different values over the course of three months. Analyses focus on how these changes predict attitudinal and behavioral responses to policies and scientific recommendations. The project also examines the roles of factors such as the severity of the pandemic, socio-economic condition, and existing value systems in these changes.

Seasonal return of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) will be even more devastating. One of the primary ways that SARS-CoV-2 appears to spread is through people touching surfaces with virus-laden droplets. Virus survivability on surfaces varies greatly by droplet size and composition, surface material and texture, and the ambient temperature and relative humidity. These factors impact the concentration of salt and other solutes in the process of droplets drying on surfaces, which strongly influences the survival of viruses in the droplets. This project will address survivability of viruses inside droplets and its relationship to droplet size, type of surface and ambient conditions representing seasonal variations. The team will especially seek to understand conditions under which virus survival in surface-adherent droplets is diminished. This information is crucial for public health officials, virologists, and other experts working on disinfection efforts to control and mitigate current and future COVID-19 outbreaks.<br/><br/>This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team of engineers, virologists, and infectious disease experts to understand the mechanisms that determine virus survival/annihilation on different surfaces under varying seasonal conditions. The research plan combines computer simulations and experiments to reveal what happens inside droplets under conditions specific to COVID-19 scenarios. More specifically, this project will study the thermal and mass transport processes that occur in droplets drying on various surfaces. Project results will include quantitative information on the solute (salt, protein) concentration-time pathways in the interior of virus-carrying droplets drying on surfaces. These pathways will be quantified as functions of droplet size, composition, ambient temperature and relative humidity, and surface characteristics. Novel laser and chemical treatments of surfaces will be employed to modify hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity over a wide range to examine the effect of such modifications on droplet drying processes. This project will therefore reveal what types of seasonal conditions and surface modifications will contribute to diminished survival of viruses within droplets. The project team will transition project results to experts who study methods to deactivate viruses. Arming them with precise knowledge on the thermochemical conditions faced by the pathogens within drying droplets will enable them to focus attention on effective disinfection techniques.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Thermal Transport Processes program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their widespread use in technology and the arts results in a high cost. It also justifies extensive mining, which has a high environmental and human health impact. The reason for their scarcity is that they were scavenged into the core when Earth separated into a silicate outer layer (mantle and crust) and a metallic core. Even if these elements are highly depleted in the mantle, previous experimental work indicates that they are overabundant relative to expectation for scavenging by the core. Available experiments suggest that the mantle should be completely barren of these elements, which is not what is seen. A likely explanation for this discrepancy between experiments and observations is that the highly siderophile elements were delivered into the Earth's mantle by the late impact addition of meteoritic material after the core had formed. There are differences however between the composition of the mantle and meteorites, notably for ruthenium, and an important question is whether previous experiments reliably predict the scavenging of highly siderophile elements in the core. These experiments were limited in the pressure-temperature conditions that they could achieve and relies on large extrapolations to make inferences about the scavenging efficiency of the core. A new experimental approach relying on the laser ionization of selected highly siderophile elements coupled with experiments done in diamond anvil cells that can routinely reach pressures of 700,000 atmospheres and temperatures of 4500 K, will allow the partitioning of highly siderophile elements to be measured under core formation conditions without relying on large extrapolations. This work will apply a relatively new technique (Resonant Ionization Mass Spectrometry - RIMS) to in situ ultratrace analyses, which can find applications in a variety of fields outside of Earth sciences, including material sciences/development and nuclear forensics.  The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist. The project will support two graduate as well as undergraduate students, who will be trained on a multidisciplinary research project. The PIs will also be involved in outreach at the K-12 level through the French-American Science Festival.<br/><br/>The reason for the depletions in highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the mantle is their removal into Earth?s core, and their subsequent replenishment by late accretion of extraterrestrial material representing ~0.5 % of Earth?s mass. To first order, this model of late delivery of chondritic material to the Earth can account for the abundance of HSEs in the mantle but it fails to explain the elevated Ru/Pt and Pd/Pt ratios in the mantle relative to chondrites and other HSEs. One explanation for these high ratios is that Ru and Pd may be less siderophile or chalcophile compared to other HSEs, resulting in their partial retention in mantle when the core formed. Testing this hypothesis is however difficult because the relevant metal/silicate partitioning experiments have been done at P-T conditions that are quite remote from those that are thought to have prevailed during core formation. The investigators will study the origin of HSEs in Earth?s mantle by applying a novel ultra-trace element quantification technique known as RIMS to measure the concentrations of selected HSEs in metal-silicate experiments done using piston cylinders and diamond anvil cells (DACs). Through this collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist, the research group will study the effect of nano/micro metal nuggets on metal/silicate partition data, and will measure the partition coefficients of Ru, Pd, and Pt at 0?70 GPa and 2100?4500 K, which spans conditions relevant to core formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The setting is a unique organization: a medical clinic owned by the subgroup.  To treat patients both from the subgroup and not from the subgroup in their clinic, the subgroup?s approach to treatment centers on the integration of distinct modalities including conventional, integrative, and traditional treatment.  This project examines the impact of subgroup ownership of the clinic on the creation of new forms of treatment.  It also examines how distinct treatment modalities, often considered incompatible because they involve different theories, practices, and evidence, are negotiated in a single institution.  This project reveals how practitioners collaborate across epistemological and methodological divides in their attempt to establish more efficient and effective practices.  In so doing, it contributes to the sociology of science and technology and medical sociology as it explores changing boundaries.<br/><br/>The methods for this study involve participant observation, interviews, and document analysis.  Participant observation allows answering questions concerning subgroup healing practices and combining modalities.  Approximately 40 interviews are being held with subgroup personnel involved with the establishment and operation of the clinic.

However, black-box ML models, which rely solely on training data and<br/>ignore existing scientific knowledge have met with limited success in scientific problems, particularly<br/>when labeled data is limited, sometimes even leading to spectacular failures. This is because the black<br/>box ML models are susceptible to learning spurious relationships that do not generalize well outside the<br/>data they are trained for. The emerging paradigm of physics-guided machine learning (PGML), which<br/>leverages the unique ability of ML algorithms to automatically extract patterns and models from data with<br/>guidance of the knowledge accumulated in physics (or scientific theories), aims to address the challenges<br/>faced by black box ML in scientific applications. Significant exploratory efforts are needed to formulate and assess sound PGML approaches for particular scientific problems.<br/><br/>For data science, PGML has the potential to transform ML beyond black-box applications by enabling<br/>solutions that generalize well even on unseen input-output distributions that are different from those<br/>encountered during training, by anchoring ML methods with the scientific body of knowledge. PGML makes a distinct<br/>departure from the conventional view that physics-based models and ML models are developed in<br/>isolation but seldom mixed together. The proposed project is fundamentally different from existing body<br/>of research that attempts to combine ML and domain sciences, e.g., by making use of domain-specific<br/>knowledge in ML algorithms in simplistic ways, or making use of data in the physics-based modeling<br/>process albeit without allowing data to change the functional forms of existing physics-based models.

Although our experimental work will be related to COVID-19, the methods can be applied with some reservations to any literature-based analysis. For example, in the Materials Science Initiative, one of the goals is to establish a systematic understanding of the material properties and discover new materials which can be done by analyzing using the massive corpus of papers. In the legal world, identifying related patents can be done using a similar hypothesis modeling methodology.<br/><br/>In the heart of the proposed approach lies a big multi-modal and multi-relational semantic knowledge network of all biomedical objects extracted from a variety of heterogeneous databases of the National Library of Medicine. These objects include but are not limited to scientific papers, abstracts, keywords, phrases, elements of thesaurus, genes, proteins, mutations, pathways, diseases, and diagnoses. We will leverage two systems, namely MOLIERE and AGATHA, that are based on structural and deep learning, respectively. We will customize them using the rapidly updated dataset of new papers that has not been yet processed by the National Library of Medicine but already exists in the open domain such as in various preprint archives and reports. The MOLIERE system is based on the network analysis techniques applied on the graph constructed using the low-dimensional embedding of the papers with the result interpretation methods that are based on the probabilistic topic modeling. The AGATHA system processes texts at much finer granularity, and creates a semantic knowledge network using more accurate embedding techniques followed by the deep learning training for knowledge discovery. Two systems complement each other. While the AGATHA is of higher quality, the MOLIERE is more interpretable. A combination of both will be leveraged in this research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning approach to identify COVID-19 patients at risk for cardiac dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Utilizing such an approach will provide early warning and enable the delivery of early goal-directed therapy, reducing mortality and optimizing allocation of resources. The machine learning classifier is to be distributed to any interested healthcare institution, to augment their ability to successfully treat patients. This project also provides fundamental new scientific knowledge: how COVID-19-related cardiac injury could result in cardiac dysfunction and sudden cardiac death. Such knowledge is of paramount importance in the fight against COVID-19 and the post-disease adverse effects on human health. <br/><br/>Features that will serve as input into the machine learning classifier will be extracted from both time series (ECG, cardiac-specific laboratory values, continuously-obtained vital signs) and imaging data (CT, echocardiography). Data will be collected from patients admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins Health System; other hospitals in the Chesapeake area; and potetially hospitals in NYC, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on nucleic acid or polymerase chain reaction testing. We will develop a time-varying risk score that will determine the posterior probability of hemodynamically-significant cardiac disease outcome within 24 hours of certain time points.

Many illnesses, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, and neurological diseases, can be treated by controlling the activity or abundance of specific proteins in the cell. However, many proteins cannot be targeted by traditional drugs. Instead, pharmaceutical companies are now using a new strategy to hijack the cell?s native quality control pathways and degrade proteins to control their abundance rather than their activity. This approach has been validated as a powerful therapeutic strategy, but significant challenges remain for discovering molecular glues. The proposed platform for molecular glue discovery is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by conducting high-throughput screening. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to advance the development of a novel platform for discovering molecular glues, or drugs that function by agonizing protein-protein interactions. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Initial results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells can be used to simultaneously measure the affinity of many protein-protein interactions with high accuracy and correctly determine the effect of well-characterized small molecules that inhibit or enhance particular protein-protein interactions. Additionally, the platform is functional in a 96-well plate format, which is important for compatibility with standard high-throughput screening workflows. The primary goals of this project are to improve the sensitivity of the platform for the detection of molecular glues that induce a weak protein-protein interaction, reduce the per-well screening cost by improving assay efficiency, and incorporate new proteins into the platform and validate their function with existing small-molecules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main scientific goal of this project is to study the nature of light-matter interaction in single-molecule and single-ion magnets and achieve quantum coherent control over the molecular spin. The main scientific goal of this proposal is to study the nature of light-matter interaction in molecular nanomagnets and achieve quantum coherent control over the molecular spin. In particular, the objective is to coherently control the time evolution of the spin of molecules upon application of fast pulsed microwave irradiation in the weak coupling regime at sub-Kelvin temperatures (>50 mK) for which dipolar dephasing will be suppressed due to polarization of the spin bath without the need of large magnetic fields. This will open a window into the fundamental sources of decoherence in single crystals of SMMs in an energy range (frequencies <10GHz, and magnetic fields <1T) never before explored. The technique has already been demonstrated by the PI under prior NSF-DMR support. This milli-Kelvin time-resolved EPR capability is unique worldwide and will allow exploring dynamical effects in SMMs and SIMs directly associated to the intrinsic anisotropy of the system, placing the PI?s group in a leading position within the field. This is a high risk-high reward project in that proof-of-concept experimental results have only been obtained in standard spectroscopic spin markers. The challenge resides in expanding these studies into single crystals of molecular nanomagnets, which will require identification of viable candidate samples and will rely on weak effects of dephasing sources other than the one that can be eliminated with the PI?s new technique (dipolar dephasing). However, if the technique works with molecular magnets, it will open an exciting door to explore the quantum dynamics of spin in an energy and temperature range never explored before (high reward), allowing exploring a realm of low magnetic fields when the systems respond to the intrinsic and complex anisotropy symmetries that make molecular nanomagnets unique.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scope and intensity of global change biology in oceans demands an interdisciplinary approach to research, and the field brings together scientists from a diverse range of disciplines, including physical, chemical and biological oceanography, along with evolution and ecology. Historically, it has been challenging to bring together this community at a single meeting, however, since the inaugural meeting of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Ocean Global Change Biology in 2014, and subsequent meetings in 2016 and 2018, an unparalleled opportunity for the community to meet in a retreat-like setting to share cutting- edge work has been created. To date, the Ocean Global Change Biology GRCs have been very successful with excellent attendance and contributions, particularly from early career scientists, and have catalyzed international research, education, and outreach initiatives. This project supports partial funding for 20 U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the 2020 GRC and Gordon Research Seminar on Ocean Global Change Biology, at the Waterville Valley Conference Center in Waterville Valley, NH on July 19-24, 2020. <br/><br/>This meeting will facilitate the sharing of new results and the integration of ideas and approaches across disciplines, often using unpublished data and ideas. The 2020 conference will build on the fast-moving topics that have emerged during the three previous meetings through 9 sessions over the 5-day conference. These include the need leverage our use paleo models and analogue environments, expanding our view of multistressor changes to include top-down processes and deoxygenation, building an understanding of the roles of environmental fluctuations, connecting physiological, ecological and evolutionary responses through non-genetic inheritance, understanding the role of intraspecific variation, challenges in understanding the impact of environmental changes over different life histories, and challenges associated with tropicalization. Since this will be the fourth meeting of the ocean global change biology community, we will also take stock of how far we have come since ~2014, with a focus on how our research is being used for conservation or policy action, and setting priorities for how to improve outward-facing engagement going forward. The 2020 GRC program includes invited speakers and discussion leaders that span a range of backgrounds and career stages, from postdoctoral fellows who are putting fresh ideas forward, to established researchers who provide a broad perspective. The program prioritizes facilitating interaction across disciplines, nationalities, and career stages. Funding the 2020 GRC on Ocean Global Change Biology supports U.S scientists in attending a diverse meeting of present and future international leaders in ocean global change biology, where ideas can be discussed, research directions advanced, and priorities for multidisciplinary collaborations refined. These meetings are well attended by researchers from other countries, thus allowing U.S. scientists to fully participate in and develop international collaborations and be at the forefront of new initiatives. The GRC and Gordon Research Seminar also provides training and mentoring for students and postdoctoral researchers, and an invaluable early-career networking opportunity. More generally, the GRC will advance the communication skills and insights of the U.S. scientists during the meeting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is because the black<br/>box ML models are susceptible to learning spurious relationships that do not generalize well outside the<br/>data they are trained for. The emerging paradigm of physics-guided machine learning (PGML), which<br/>leverages the unique ability of ML algorithms to automatically extract patterns and models from data with<br/>guidance of the knowledge accumulated in physics (or scientific theories), aims to address the challenges<br/>faced by black box ML in scientific applications.<br/><br/>For data science, PGML has the potential to transform ML beyond black-box applications by enabling<br/>solutions that generalize well even on unseen input-output distributions that are different from those<br/>encountered during training, by anchoring ML methods with the scientific body of knowledge. PGML makes a distinct<br/>departure from the conventional view that physics-based models and ML models are developed in<br/>isolation but seldom mixed together.

Since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in 2019, COVID-19 has already led to over 2 million cases globally. It has spread globally, including to many vulnerable countries without adequate healthcare infrastructures. Many different responses have been tried, including social distancing, school and event closings, and travel bans. This project will develop mathematical models to address three fundamental questions: 1) how much participation and coordinated control is needed for effective protection? 2) what independent control efforts can compensate for lack of coordination to achieve effective protection? and 3) how do community population demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and health care infrastructure impact outcomes? This project aims to inform coordination of disease control policies at all scales (local, regional, national, international) to aid in curtailing the ongoing and future outbreaks. This project will advance fundamental understanding of the impacts of control efforts via a new risk perception-driven infectious disease model, and predict which drivers of public demand for community-level control efforts might lead to potentially harmful long-term decisions. The project will involve training two doctoral students in techniques related to mathematical modeling of disease dynamics and spread. <br/><br/>Many mitigation options are being weighed and implemented for COVID-19, with different decisions made at different administrative levels, including alternative quarantine strategies and different degrees of ?lockdown?. All of these decisions come with different perceptions of risk.

These models will be used to explore impacts of community population demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and health care infrastructures, and how these factors impact control efforts under different social and economic settings. With the results of these models, policy- and decision-makers can consider the impacts of specific features of the communities under their administration as contributors to a broader network of public health efforts and choose the optimal mitigation steps.

Many of these DL applications require using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to process large amounts of data. Researchers and scientists, for instance, are employing extreme-scale DL applications in HPC infrastructures to classify extreme weather patterns and high-energy particles. In recent years, using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate DL applications has attracted increasing attention. However, the ever-increasing scales of DL applications bring many challenges to today?s GPU-based HPC infrastructures. The key challenge is the huge gap (e.g., one to two orders of magnitude) between the memory requirement and its availability on GPUs. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a novel framework to reduce the memory demand effectively and efficiently via data compression technologies for extreme-scale DL applications. The proposed research will enhance the GPU-based HPC infrastructures in broad communities for many scientific disciplines that rely on DL technologies. The project will connect machine learning and HPC communities and increase interactions between them. Educational and engagement activities include developing new curriculum related to data compression, mentoring a selected group of high school students in a year-long  research project for a regional Science Fair competition, and increasing the community's understanding of leveraging HPC infrastructures for DL technologies. The project will also encourage student interest in research related to DL technologies on HPC environment and promote research collaborations with multiple national laboratories.<br/><br/>Existing state-of-the-art GPU memory saving methods for training extreme-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer from high performance overhead and/or low memory footprint reduction. Error-bounded lossy compression is a promising approach to significantly reduce the memory footprint while still meeting the required analysis accuracy. This project will explore how to leverage error-bounded lossy compression on DNN intermediate data to reduce the memory footprint for extreme-scale DNN training. The project has a three-stage research plan. First, the team will comprehensively investigate the impacts of applying error-bounded lossy compression to DNN intermediate data on both validation accuracy and training performance, using different error-bounded lossy compressors, compression modes, and error bounds on the targeted DNNs and datasets. Second, the team will optimize the compression quality of suitable error-bounded lossy compressors on different intermediate data based on the impact analysis outcome, and design an efficient scheme to adaptively apply a best-fit compression solution. Finally, the team will optimize the compression performance on the proposed lossy compression framework for state-of-the-art GPUs. The team will evaluate the proposed framework on high-resolution climate analytics and high-energy particle physics applications and compare it with existing state-of-the-art techniques based on both the memory footprint reduction ratio and training performance improvements (e.g., throughput, time, epoch number).  The project will enable scientists and researchers to train extreme-scale DNNs with a given set of computing resources in a fast and efficient manner, opening opportunities for new discoveries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last few decades saw a plethora of new geometric-spanner construction algorithms and a multitude of structural results. Despite such monumental work, there remains a gap between theory and practice of geometric spanners. The investigator and a team of student researchers will aim to narrow down this gap through algorithm engineering and experiments.

The collaborative research activities in this project will prepare the participating students, primarily undergraduates, for the future of theory and practice of geometric computing. Engineering and experiments with such algorithms will serve as a unique learning experience for these students to deal with practical issues of algorithmic efficiency.

This project will implement two specific initiatives for outreach: (i) organization of summer coding camps for local high school students, and (ii) organization of high-school programming competition. Minority and underrepresented students will be highly encouraged to join this research.<br/><br/>Geometric spanners are mainly of theoretical interest to geometers.  The main limitation of the theoretical approach is the lack of specificity.  A pencil-and-paper geometric-spanner construction algorithm is a far cry from a working program, and considerable effort is required to fill in the details to get from the former to the latter. Without engineering and experiments, these state-of-the-art algorithms may remain confined forever in the theoretical arena.  In this project, the geometric spanner construction algorithms will be treated as laboratory subjects, akin to natural sciences and much different from traditional theoretical analysis. This will likely open up new directions in the field. In the era of  Big  Data,  geometric datasets are abundant and are being generated at an unprecedented rate.  Without rigorous and systematic experimentation,  it remains unknown which of these construction algorithms are practical, especially for massive point sets (having millions of points).  The design of new practical heuristics will increase their real-world performance, in terms of speed,  memory,  and quality of the generated spanners.  A renewed focus on these algorithms will provide new insights regarding their practical uses for massive point sets, which otherwise cannot be obtained from their theoretical analyses. Parallel adaptations of the practical algorithms (to be determined using rigorous and systematic experiments) and the design of new provably efficient practical hybrid algorithms will be beneficial in this age of Big Data. Theoretical analyses will be obtained to support the experimental observations, which will provide a holistic view of their practical performance. New theoretical results are likely to be obtained from the algorithm experiments to be conducted.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These new materials, glyonic liquids, are made from biomass (e.g., sugars) and are biodegradable and nontoxic. The goal of this research is to optimize the conductive properties of these materials by molecular design and tp explore their applications as green, renewable conductive electrolytes in devices used for sensing and energy conversion and storage. The project lies at the interface of organic, physical  and materials chemistry.  This effort will also support the development of new intellectual property and educational initiatives at the graduate, undergraduate and K-12 science levels, with a particular emphasis on impacting members of underrepresented groups who are a large demographic base in southern Arizona. Outreach activities include the development of a workshop for in-service secondary science teachers on green chemistry and sustainability.<br/><br/>Glyonic liquids are a new type of protic ionic liquid structurally based on a rhamnolipid platform as the anion can be paired with a variety of cations. These materials have demonstrated intriguing conductive properties that might make them excellent choices for use in electrochemical devices. Toward that end, this effort involves three specific objectives: 1) synthesis and property tuning of glyonic liquids based on the rhamnolipid structural motif through exploitation of synthetic handles that facilitate retention of these materials in the liquid state at or near room temperature; 2) exploration of electrochemical applications of these glyonic liquids; and 3) computational studies on glyonic liquids to define inter/intramolecular interactions and structure at the nano- and meso-scales as a function of temperature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there are currently no effective treatments for COVID-19. Traditional methodologies take years to develop and test compounds from scratch. Machine learning provides promising new approaches to repurpose drugs that are safe and already approved for other diseases. This project will develop a machine learning toolset to expedite the development of safe and effective medicines for COVID-19. The toolset will rapidly identify safe repurposing opportunities for approved and experimental drugs. It will predict whether treatments may have therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients, allowing the identification of drugs and drug cocktails that are safe and plentiful enough to treat a substantial number of patients. By putting tools in the hand of practitioners, the activities in this project will have an immediate impact. They will result in actionable predictions that are accurate and interpretable. <br/><br/>Recently, the principal investigators have developed a series of machine learning tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. Building on foundational previous work, in this project, the principal investigators will first build a large COVID-19 focused knowledge graph that will capture fundamental and COVID-19-specific biological knowledge. The graph learning methods will be adapted to identify safe drugs and drug cocktails for COVID-19. To predict the safety of cocktails with two or more drugs, the methods will generalize to an exponentially large space of high-order drug combinations. In addition to drug safety, efficacy is a crucial endpoint for drug development. The project will develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) method to identify efficacious drug repurposing opportunities, even for diseases, such as COVID-19, that do not yet have any drug treatments and thereby, no label, supervised information. The method will predict what drugs and drug combinations may have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. Finally, the principal investigators will integrate the developed tools into a complete, explainable framework that will generate predictions, provide explanations, and incorporate human feedback into the machine learning loop. This project will provide new, open tools for rapid drug repurposing that will be relevant for COVID-19 and other emerging pathogens. Additionally, the project will provide unique opportunities for multi-disciplinary curriculum development, training and advising, and professional activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tornado moved within very close range of instrumentation operated by the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM), including a weather radar and other instruments that provide measurements of wind and temperature at the surface and aloft. This award will allow the investigator team to perform an enhanced damage survey and initial scientific analysis of the unique storm system that produced the tornado. The broader societal impact of the project is through the identification of the factors that led to this strong tornado, in order to provide better forecasts of severe weather in the future. Several students will be involved in the analysis, ensuring the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The Monroe tornado of Easter Sunday 2020 moved within 1 km of the S-band, dual-polarimetric radar operated by ULM. Additionally, measurements from a Doppler wind lidar, microwave radiometer, and multiple surface stations were collected. The tornado was embedded in a Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS), which traditionally produce mostly weak tornadoes. However, the Monroe tornado was a strong EF-3 tornado, leading to question about how it reached that intensity. Several hypotheses related to Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS) tornadogenesis will be addressed using the measurements from this tornado: 1) A surging baroclinic boundary enhances the near-storm QLCS environment, making it more conducive to tornadogenesis by locally increasing low-level (i) wind shear, (ii) instability, and (iii) convergence, 2) A relatively warmer QLCS outflow promotes stretching of surface vorticity, and 3) Observable radar reflectivity structures, such as bowing segments, can be linked the success or failure of QLCS tornadogenesis.<br/><br/>Additionally, given the close approach of the tornado to the ULM radar, links between the radar data and damage path can be made, improving our understanding of how remotely sensed radar data correlates to tornadoes in real-time.

Children play an important role in the transmission of contagious illness, given how frequently they engage in risky behaviors such as touching their faces or making physical contact with caregivers. Public health recommendations include teaching best practice to children to reduce disease spread, but prior research shows that children are unlikely to engage in these practices without a firm understanding of the underlying process of disease transmission. This RAPID award to a team of researchers at the University of Michigan will assess what children know, what they don't know, and what they think they know (but is scientifically inaccurate) about the transmission of COVID-19. In conducting a comprehensive assessment with children aged 5-12 years and their parents, the researchers will address such questions as: At what ages do children understand aspects of viral transmission that are non-obvious or invisible, such as asymptomatic carriers, or the potential for objects and surfaces to carry infection? At what ages can children go beyond isolated facts they have learned to figure out what to do in new situations? How is children's biological reasoning influenced by non-biological factors, such whether a potential carrier is a friend or a stranger? How does children's reasoning about a pandemic that has already massively disrupted their daily lives (COVID-19) compare with their reasoning about a more ordinary and innocuous illness (the common cold)? Findings from the project will inform parents, educators, researchers, and public health professionals about children's understanding of the transmission of disease in general, and COVID-19 in particular. It will lay the foundation for the rapid development of evidence-based educational interventions that target gaps and misconceptions in children?s understanding, thereby improving both scientific literacy and adherence to public health guidelines. This RAPID award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program in DRL, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. ECR supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning. <br/><br/>The research team will interview children age 5-12 years and their parents, employing a battery of measures to assess children's understanding of the biological processes of viral transmission, comparing COVID-19 with the common cold. Study 1 will address children's understanding of how and why viruses work and spread, with a battery of child-friendly tasks that assess: incubation periods (lag between infection and disease onset), asymptomatic hosts, that viruses can survive on a surface or object (such as a doorknob), and that viruses can gain access to the body through the eyes, nose, and mouth. Study 2 will focus on who may contract, transmit, or suffer the consequences of viral disease, and the role of both biological and non-biological factors (such as a person's nationality, language, or familiarity) in these judgments. For example, children will receive a series of vignettes, each involving two hypothetical characters of different social identities, where disease transmission is a possibility, and will be asked to assess the likelihood that the character will contract the illness, how sick the character will get, and whether or not the character will transmit the illness to another person. While in-person contact is restricted, children will be interviewed via face-to-face remote video and a Qualtrics survey link sent to the parent/guardian. Interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and coded. Intercorrelations among children's performance across the different tasks will assess whether understanding consists of piecemeal facts as opposed to coherent understandings. Determining children's understanding of disease transmission during this global pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify gaps and misconceptions in children's understanding of viral transmission, to provide a foundation for developing effective educational programming about biology in the elementary and middle school years. It will also be a source of theoretically significant data of central interest to STEM education regarding the coherence of children's biological theories over developmental time, and how children's informal biological theories may shift in the context of an ongoing health crisis. The project will provide a foundation for improving biological education, as well as for public health and children's understanding of and reactions to illness in others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes in the angle of the downgoing plate can control volcanism, faulting, and basin development in the overlying continental crust. The Maniobra and Goler Formations, exposed in the Mojave Desert in southern California, provide evidence for the development of extensional basins on the overriding continental plate related to low-angle subduction in Late Cretaceous to Eocene time (~80-50 million years ago). This research will test the hypothesis that Late Cretaceous extension resulted in the development of the Maniobra and Goler Basins, while simultaneously introducing more than 50 undergraduate and 2 Masters students to the techniques of basin analysis. The field sites in the Mojave Desert, located within 3 hours of Los Angeles, provide a natural laboratory to train the next generation of geoscientists. Students from a Hispanic-serving institution will learn modern geologic techniques, such as geologic mapping, geochronology, paleomagnetism, and thermochronology, that can be applied to their graduate and post-graduate careers. Analytical data from this research will be made available on community databases, and results of the proposed research will be used to construct a publicly-available online learning module.<br/><br/>Recent tectonic models of the southwestern US Cordillera have invoked the subduction of an oceanic plateau, the conjugate Shatsky Rise, as a driver of slab flattening, subduction erosion and arc cessation in Late Cretaceous to Eocene time. Subduction, and subsequent passage of the plateau, likely promoted extension and associated regional paleogeographic changes, such as basin development and block rotations. This study targets the Goler and Maniobra Formations, which are the only Late Cretaceous to Eocene basinal strata located along the interpreted subduction pathway. This research will test the hypothesis that gravitational collapse in the wake of plateau subduction was widespread across the Mojave region in the Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic and led to the development of supra-detachment basins and the exhumation of relict subduction complexes. This research will incorporate new mapping of stratigraphic and structural relationships, combined with magnetostratigraphy, detrital zircon provenance analysis, and basement and detrital thermochronology. This data will constrain the timing and duration of basin formation and enable the evaluation of different tectonic models of basin development. New basin analysis results from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene Goler and Maniobra Formations will provide a crucial link between plateau subduction processes and related surface deformation and will highlight the complexity of tectonic evolution along a highly segmented margin over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this planning grant is to develop a network of researchers working to create a shared vision for classrooms that engage persons with disabilities, both visible and concealable, considering both a curricular and physical perspective. For the purpose of this project, a student with a disability is defined to be a student that is registered with the Disability Resource Center or equivalent office. While science and engineering education are both trending toward more active learning approaches, most active learning approaches assume that students are able-bodied. At the same time, many higher education classrooms, particularly large lecture halls used for introductory science and engineering courses, were designed and constructed prior to current Americans with Disabilities Act regulations, so the physical spaces may present additional barriers to engaging persons with disabilities in science and engineering classrooms.<br/><br/>The approach to this shared visioning project is to convene workshops that bring together faculty, disability resource staff, and capital projects staff to develop a common agenda for creating inclusive classrooms that effectively engage persons with disabilities. In particular, two workshops will be convened to outline the goals of inclusive classroom pedagogy and (physical) design and highlight relevant research and best practices in each. The first workshop will seek to bring pedagogical knowledge to physical space designers and vice versa, enabling each group to think more critically about how their work impacts the other. The second workshop will focus on implementation of inclusive classrooms, highlighting successes and challenging participants to develop a plan to design and build inclusive classrooms and pedagogies that can be shared more broadly.

The results of this project will provide a deeper understanding of the social mechanisms that shape perceptions and behaviors to public policy responses in culturally and politically diverse contexts. Perceptions of disease (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, and threat) shape perceived barriers and benefits to action, which in turn affect behavior.

In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.<br/>  <br/>The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how people process ?noisy? information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. In these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports research that will lead to control paradigms for AVs operating in mixed traffic conditions, particularly when traffic is dense and safe operations require effective automated car-following and lane-changing controls.  The project is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the future transportation ecosystem and the controls needed to guide the ecosystem toward an equilibrium that benefits society.  The accompanying educational plan aims to fundamentally redesign the transportation engineering curricula via new graduate course development and outreach programs, leveraging the COSMOS testbed deployed in Columbia?s neighborhood.  The outcomes of this research will be assessed by an advisory committee of select leaders from academia, public agencies, and the AV industry. <br/><br/>This research develops a new modeling framework that builds from the fields of game theory, dynamic control, data science, and transportation engineering.  Mean-field game-theoretic methods are used to characterize the dynamic behavior of the mixed traffic system and to examine optimal policies associated with infrastructure planning and the regulation of technology.  This framework provides a rigorous foundation for the development of a multi-agent simulation platform to inform policy and practice as part of the development of the transportation ecosystem. The analytical framework leverages the state-of-the-art techniques from game theory and AI methods.

Those daily rhythms are governed by an autonomous circadian pacemaker. Although the molecular mechanism of the circadian rhythm generation has been studied in depth, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of novel circadian pacemakers that can oscillate without the canonical circadian molecular machinery.  These novel pacemakers are revealed by the activation of a reward system. With state-of-the-art circadian behavior recording apparatus and real-time circadian gene-reporting developed by the principal investigator, this project uncovers the functional significance of the novel non-canonical circadian pacemaker revealed by palatable meals. This project provides opportunities to individuals at all stages of learning, from high school students to postdoctoral trainees, to participate in experiments that advance understanding of the role and function of the non-canonical circadian pacemaker. An additional goal of this project is to extend scientific knowledge to a young generation of learners. To this end, the principal investigator and trainees engage in outreach programs to share their knowledge of circadian rhythms in classrooms of underrepresented middle and high school students in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.<br/><br/>The mammalian circadian system is a hierarchical network of oscillators optimally coordinating behavior and physiology with daily environmental cycles. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is at the top of this hierarchy because it synchronizes to the light-dark cycle, which is often the dominant environmental cycle. The laboratory of the principal investigator recently discovered that timed access to a palatable meal reveals an endogenous behavioral rhythm in mutant mice, of which all the canonical circadian oscillators were genetically disabled. This revealed rhythm, the palatable meal-inducible circadian oscillator (PICO), persists for several cycles under ad libitum feeding after termination of the palatable meal feeding schedule. In this project, the investigator uses molecular tool sets to examine the role of and map the dopamine reward input pathways that evoke the PICO-driven behavior rhythm. This project also uncovers how the SCN and PICO coordinate circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues and optimally tune physiological events to adapt to environmental daily cycles. The project thereby will transform current understanding of the multi-oscillator circadian network in mammals, which is critically involved in the temporal regulation of physiology and behavior to optimally adapt to daily changes in the environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research participation is linked to increased student persistence in STEM, especially for students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM.  Thus, by increasing the number and diversity of students who have a research experience, CURES also broaden participation in STEM careers.  CURES typically engage student teams in hands-on work in laboratories or field sites.  With the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the national CURE education landscape quickly and dramatically changed to a fully ?online? mode, with limited opportunity for advance planning.  Thus, this situation presents a unique and urgent opportunity to explore how CUREs evolve in a new online environment, as well as whether they continue to achieve core CURE educational goals.  It also allows for assessment of whether these rapid course changes have equitable outcomes for all students, including first-generation students, students on financial aid, and from different socioeconomic backgrounds.  If CUREs are a solution for engaging large numbers of early-stage undergraduates in authentic STEM research, then the feasibility to translate CUREs online must be known.  It is important to understand the structure of these newly online CUREs, in what situation they are effective, and who they benefit.  The results of this project have the potential to expand understanding of CURE instructional approaches and outcomes, for both practitioners and researchers.  Additionally, this unexpected shift to online coursework is an opportunity to engage broader higher education audiences in new thinking about course configuration, online effectiveness, and supports and barriers for online teaching.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) capture and analyze how CURE course activities are rapidly translated into online formats; and 2) assess effects of course changes on students with different demographic profiles.  It will provide early evidence to answer if, how, and why CURE benefits are realized through the different modality of online teaching.  Importantly, this project will not make conclusions about the quality of online CUREs or online teaching overall; instead, it will explore which CURE activities can be readily delivered online, how they get delivered, how students respond, and how this new way of teaching changes/expands how instructors think about CUREs.  The present project will use a mixed-methods design to track online implementation of CURE courses in two samples.  The first sample will include a diverse set of local CUREs that span multiple STEM departments and have an array of course objectives/structures.  This collection of CUREs will afford an in-depth, qualitative case study investigation that will capture and analyze instructors? thinking, plans, and products, before, during, and after the shift from hands-on, laboratory-based CUREs to ones that are now abruptly online.  The second sample will include CURE courses from a national network, which will allow us to explore more broadly and in a more quantitative way, how a large number of instructors transitioned to online.  The project will also examine the resulting emotions, motivations, and experiences of students during this transition and how this semester?s student outcomes compare to those from prior years, through analysis of a historical student outcomes database.  This approach will provide broad reach and comparison among a relatively homogenous set of CUREs, since all CURE instructors in this network are trained in the same research approach, have similar course objectives, and use similar materials.

Not much is known about how Antarctica?s ice sheets might respond to ongoing and future warming, but such knowledge is important because Antarctica?s ice sheets might raise global sea levels significantly with continued melting. Over time, mud accumulates on the sea floor around Antarctica that is composed of the skeletons and debris of microscopic marine organisms and sediment from the adjacent continent. As this mud is deposited, it creates a record of past environmental and ecological changes, including ocean depth, glacier advance and retreat, ocean temperature, ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, ocean chemistry, and continental weathering. Scientists interested in understanding how Antarctica?s glaciers and ice sheets might respond to ongoing warming can use a variety of physical, biological, and chemical analyses of these mud archives to determine how long ago the mud was deposited and how the ice sheets, oceans, and marine ecosystems responded during intervals in the past when Earth?s climate was warmer. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida, University of Massachusetts, and Northern Illinois University will reconstruct the depth, ocean temperature, weathering and nutrient input, and marine ecosystems in the central Ross Sea from ~17 to 13 million years ago, when the warm Miocene Climate Optimum transitioned to a cooler interval with more extensive ice sheets. Record will be generated from new sediments recovered during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374 and legacy sequences recovered in the 1970?s during the Deep Sea Drilling Program. Results will be integrated into ice sheet and climate models to improve the accuracy of predictions. The research provides experience for three graduate students and seven undergraduate students via a multi-institutional REU program focused on increasing diversity in Antarctic Earth Sciences. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Deep-sea sediments reveal that the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) was the warmest climate interval of the last ~20 Ma, was associated with global carbon cycle changes and ice growth, and immediately preceded the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; ~14 Ma), one of three major intervals of Antarctic ice expansion and global cooling. Ice-proximal studies are required to assess: where and when ice grew, ice sheet extent, continental shelf geometry, high-latitude heat and moisture supply, oceanic and/or atmospheric temperature influence on ice dynamics, regional sea ice extent, meltwater input, and regions of bottom water formation. Existing studies indicate that ice expanded beyond the Transantarctic Mountains and onto the prograding Ross Sea continental shelf multiple times between ~17 and 13.5 Ma. However, these records are either too ice-proximal/terrestrial to adequately assess ocean-ice interactions or under-studied. To address this data gap, this work will: 1) generate micropaleontologic and geochemical records of oceanic and atmospheric temperature, water depth, ocean circulation, and paleoproductivity from existing Ross Sea marine sedimentary sequences, and 2) use these proxy records to test the hypothesis that dynamic glacial expansion in the Ross Sea sector during the MCO was driven by heat and moisture transport to the high latitudes during an interval of enhanced climate sensitivity. Downcore geochemical and micropaleontologic studies will focus on an expanded (120 m/my) early to middle Miocene (~17-16 Ma) diatom-bearing/rich mudstone/diatomite unit from IODP Site U1521, drilled on the Ross Sea continental shelf. A hiatus (~16-14.6 Ma) suggests ice expansion during the MCO, followed by diamictite to mudstone unit indicative of slight retreat (14.6 -14 Ma) immediately preceding the MMCT. Data from Site U1521 will be integrated with foraminiferal geochemical and micropaleontologic data from DSDP Leg 28 (1972/73) and RISP J-9 (1978-79) to develop a MCO to late Miocene regional view of ocean-ice sheet interactions using legacy core material previously processed for foraminifera. This integrated record will: 1) document the timing and extent of glacial advances and retreats across the prograding Ross Sea shelf during the middle and late Miocene, 2) provide orbital-scale paleotemperature reconstructions (TEX86, Mg/Ca, ?18O, MBT/CBT) to establish atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions during an extreme high-latitude warm interval, and 3) provide orbital-scale nutrient/paleoproductivity, ocean circulation, and paleoenvironmental data required to assess climate feedbacks associated with Miocene Antarctic ice sheet and global climate system development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent pandemic highlights this, as well as the need for methods to determine timely decisions for strategic interventions that reduce the impact of the pandemic on populations. Use of  network traffic models account for flow of the disease via carriers from the initial source of the pandemic and between centers of infections, and addresses the long-distance spread of the disease. Non-medical solutions that immediately attempt to reduce the spread of pandemic include intra-city restrictions and inter-city strategies that involve suppression of population transfer. Critical actions include decisions on the level of suppression, the routes over which suppression has to be applied, and the time at which it has to be applied. Reducing the mitigation or suppression must critically account for the re-occurrence of the disease. The level of  suppression has economic  consequences with  immediate and potential long term impacts on employment and economic growth, and can run counter to maintaining essential services such as food distribution, medical facilities, and first responders. This project will develop novel techniques to analyze pandemic models and design new optimization algorithms that  provide decision strategies, accounting for costs, including the economic costs of suppression. This research has time urgency as there is a need for strategic analysis in the current pandemic and the project will utilize timely insights from the data available. Additionally, the insights will assist in determining decision strategies for future occurrences.<br/><br/>This RAPID project will identify and refine network models of pandemic spread using a hierarchical model that incorporates the traffic network between major cities and countries at the first level. The subsequent levels will utilize local traffic networks and mobility patterns in centers of large populations. The models will include (i) subdivision of  populations into classes that represent the  current state of the pandemic, examples being population sets that are susceptible, infected, suppressed and recovered, all parameterized by time, (ii) multiple source and destination network flow models of infection flow, and (iii) geographic models of infection spread in local population clusters. This project will apply optimization techniques and network analysis to analyze the models and design algorithms for determining decision strategies. Evolution of the population sets, as modeled by differential equations solved using numerical  methods and discrete analogs, will be investigated. Methods to determine parameters that regulate the transfer rates between populations will be designed. The model will be used to define mathematical programs in order to optimize decision parameters that include the level of suppression and the time at which to relax suppression. Network flow techniques will be used  to minimize the flow of infection with multiple key objectives, especially to minimize the peak levels of the spread.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our society uses algorithms to solve problems ranging from making investment decisions in personal financial planning, to allocating resources in large-scale computing systems such as data centers. Often, these problems are difficult because of uncertainty about the future. In algorithmic theory, traditionally conservative approaches are used which provide relatively weak but highly robust guarantees that hold no matter how the future unfolds. In practice, a more promising alternative is the use of machine-learning techniques to make algorithmic choices for the future based on knowledge of past data. By implicitly assuming that the future will mirror the past, one can provide stronger guarantees and better empirical performance. However, the ""worst-case"" robustness of the previous approach is not available, which is important if the implicit assumption of 'past predicts the future' no longer holds true. This project seeks to combine the two approaches and get the best of both worlds by exploring the interface between algorithm design and machine learning. The end goal is a comprehensive toolbox for algorithmic decision-making under uncertainty that is both robust and has good performance. In addition to this research component, the project will train graduate and undergraduate researchers in theoretical computer science, with an emphasis on participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigators' approach is to rethink each of these individual toolboxes to take advantage of the other -- namely incorporating machine-learned advice in algorithm design, and conversely, training machine learning models for algorithmic objectives. The main intellectual thrust of this project is to use machine-learned predictions to improve the quality of algorithms, and conversely, to design learning models that can be specifically trained for optimization objectives. This will be explored in two main directions: the first part considers Machine Learning as a Black Box. Here, the optimization algorithm merely consumes the predictions from the learning model. This is often the case in practice, particularly when the predictions are generated by complex systems such as deep neural networks. In this case, the focus will be on ensuring that we do not over-fit the predictions, on deciding what input parameters to predict in the first place, and on choosing between multiple alternative prediction models based on their relative accuracy, reliability, and costs. In the second part (Machine Learning as a White Box), the focus is on a more integrated design, where the optimization algorithm interacts with the learning model at runtime and ask adaptives queries. More ambitiously, the project explores a significant redesign of the end-to-end system, including the learning models and the optimization algorithms, for specific optimization tasks. This work will rely on techniques from online algorithms, stochastic and robust optimization, and learning theory, and build connections between these fields to address the central questions of algorithmic decision making under uncertainty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the measures currently undertaken, the latest projections of COVID-19 death toll range upwards of 100,000 across the U.S. The World Health Organization considers the main route of COVID-19 transmission to be through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with small respiratory droplets that are released when COVID-19 patients cough or exhale. The virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) retains infectivity on stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 hours, and the current absence of a vaccine and effective antiviral drugs makes it critical to explore novel approaches to breaking the chain of viral transmission.  The project focuses on design and initial laboratory and field testing of a spray coating technology that can be applied to a variety of surfaces to both repel virus-laden droplets and photocatalytically deactivate viral pathogens that lodge on coated surfaces.  More broadly, the project supports graduate and undergraduate training in the areas of surface coating technology and catalysis, and also engages local hospitals and university medical research facilities in assessing the efficacy of the coating technologies for combating a broad range of airborne pathogens.<br/><br/>Specifically, the research investigates the pathogen inhibiting efficacy of superhydrophobic and photocatalytic antimicrobial (SPA) coatings, a group of sprayable materials which, through their combined modes of action, can confer self-disinfecting properties to a wide array of surfaces, such as metals, concrete, ceramics, glass, and wood, to help prevent the transmission of viral, bacterial, and other pathogens for a prolonged duration of time, ranging from several months to several years.  The SPA coatings represent a novel two-pronged approach to repelling and deactivating viral pathogens.  The coatings consist of nano-TiO2 and ZnO siloxane-modified superhydrophobic layers that serve to repel respiratory droplets, thus minimizing the ability of pathogens to linger on surfaces, while also facilitating cleaning procedures. The superhydrophobic layers are intermixed with TiO2, ZnO, and Ti-phosphate layers that impart photocatalytic activity.  The photocatalytic material has potential to deactivate any pathogens that remain on the surface through the release of hydroxyl radicals. Doping of the materials with cuprous compounds further enhances the antimicrobial effect. Efficacy against the COVID-19 virus is the primary justification for the urgency of the research, which will proceed in parallel via both lab and field testing.  Beyond the immediate impact on the current pandemic, the resulting technology will improve our nation?s preparedness for future waves of the same virus or other airborne pathogens.  In addition, data obtained during the current pandemic will provide a fast track to scale-up, manufacturing and widespread deployment of the anti-viral coatings.<br/><br/>This award is being funded by the CARES Act supplemental funds allocated to ENG and MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As of April 10, 2020, there are approximately 1.7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in more than 180 countries, with over 100,000 deaths. In the US, there are more than 500,000 confirmed cases and nearly 20,000 fatalities, and these numbers are continuing to rise sharply. There is a clear and acute need for ensuring the availability of infrastructure and critical services as the epidemic progresses. Current plans for controlling the epidemic are based on forecasts from well established ?compartment? models for epidemic prediction. These models rely on differential equations based on assumptions of homogeneous populations, homogeneous mixing, and knowledge of several critical hyperparameters such as the base reproduction rate. It is well known among experts in infectious diseases and epidemic management that fitting observed data to the parameters of such models is an exercise in characterizing the epidemiology as opposed to generating valid and actionable predictions. Consequently, there is an urgent need to significantly update these models to account for the data collected on the ground from multiple data sources and locations. This is especially relevant in engineering preemptive interventions to check disease spread. Current COVID disease data are organized in a geospatial format, i.e., infected, deceased, and suspected cases indexed by geolocation, which can range from city-, county-, or state-level coarseness. This project aims to develop and demonstrate techniques that use the geospatial nature of the data, the temporal evolution of disease statistics (along with predictions), and synthesis of multiple sources of data to help rapidly and preemptively allocate available medical resources toward the areas of greatest need. <br/> <br/>Modeling the COVID-19 epidemic and designing interventions are significant challenges. This project looks at the problem through the lens of graph analytics. In particular, it seeks to use similarity information between geospatial regions of interest to improve epidemic predictions and to design effective interventions. As a first step, the problem of epidemic prediction is being modeled as the reconstruction of a high-dimensional dynamical system from low-dimensional observations. The estimates of a model thus learned will be enhanced by leveraging similarity information between the localities of interest. While the geospatial proximity graph is a natural candidate for the graph of similarities, it fails to capture long-range statistical dependencies between geographical regions based on other factors such as the sociological and biological features of a population. Using techniques from graphical modeling, this project will develop new techniques for learning statistically meaningful graphs for epidemic modeling during an ongoing pandemic. Furthermore, the accurate time-series prediction generated will be combined with the graph-based similarity measures to design effective interventions to check the spread of the epidemic. This is being approached using a stochastic formulation and emerging methods for anomaly detection on graphs with time series observations; optimal policies based on these paradigms will be translated into interventional strategies for an evolving pandemic. The project leverages partnerships with local community stakeholders in Maricopa County and the State of Arizona through the Knowledge Exchange for Resilience (KER) to implement the methodologies developed, and to ensure its technical advances can produce meaningful insights that can generalize nationally and globally.<br/> <br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to enable high-throughput inspection of semiconductor wafers via unprecedented positioning performance at an economically viable price-point. Process control, such as inspection of defects on semiconductor wafers, is currently a bottleneck for semiconductor manufacturing yield. Market demand for higher performance, increased functionality, smaller size, and lower prices in electronic chips has continued the push the industry towards smaller linewidths (currently at the 7 nm node) and more complex chip designs. This has resulted in an increasingly large number of defects per wafer, which impacts the chip functionality and therefore overall manufacturing yield. While it is desirable to inspect and evaluate more defects more frequently during the fabrication process to achieve high yield, the current slow rates of inspection lead to a throughput bottleneck. The technology developed via this project aims to overcome this tradeoff between inspection throughput and yield. The societal impact of this project will ultimately be in the form of cheaper electronics (processors, memory, sensors, etc.) that will broaden access to computers, mobile devices, automobiles, robotics, automation, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, among others.  <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop nano-positioning technology that achieves a range of several millimeters of motion, high speed, smaller settling time, nanometric accuracy, and low heat generation ? specifications previously considered impractical in a compact and cost-effective package. This project will develop nano-positioning stages that meet stringent motion specifications motivated by the needs of the semiconductor industry through innovations in parallel kinematic design, non-linear flexure mechanics, and structural dynamics with novel electromagnetic actuator architectures. These advanced nano-positioning stages will be incorporated within semiconductor process control equipment to rapidly move wafers from one defect to another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.<br/>  <br/>The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how how people process ?noisy? information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. In these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there are currently no effective treatments for COVID-19. Traditional methodologies take years to develop and test compounds from scratch. Machine learning provides promising new approaches to repurpose drugs that are safe and already approved for other diseases. This project will develop a machine learning toolset to expedite the development of safe and effective medicines for COVID-19. The toolset will rapidly identify safe repurposing opportunities for approved and experimental drugs. It will predict whether treatments may have therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients, allowing the identification of drugs and drug cocktails that are safe and plentiful enough to treat a substantial number of patients. By putting tools in the hand of practitioners, the activities in this project will have an immediate impact. They will result in actionable predictions that are accurate and interpretable. <br/><br/>Recently, the principal investigators have developed a series of machine learning tools to identify drug repurposing opportunities. Building on foundational previous work, in this project, the principal investigators will first build a large COVID-19 focused knowledge graph that will capture fundamental and COVID-19-specific biological knowledge. The graph learning methods will be adapted to identify safe drugs and drug cocktails for COVID-19. To predict the safety of cocktails with two or more drugs, the methods will generalize to an exponentially large space of high-order drug combinations. In addition to drug safety, efficacy is a crucial endpoint for drug development. The project will develop a novel graph neural network (GNN) method to identify efficacious drug repurposing opportunities, even for diseases, such as COVID-19, that do not yet have any drug treatments and thereby, no label, supervised information. The method will predict what drugs and drug combinations may have a therapeutic effect on COVID-19. Finally, the principal investigators will integrate the developed tools into a complete, explainable framework that will generate predictions, provide explanations, and incorporate human feedback into the machine learning loop. This project will provide new, open tools for rapid drug repurposing that will be relevant for COVID-19 and other emerging pathogens.

In general, patients suffering from a drug resistant UTI take longer to receive appropriate treatment, resulting in a greater risk of disease progression and onset of secondary comorbidities.  Diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify drug-resistant UTIs will have a strong and positive impact on the treatment of these infections. The proposed work aims to optimize and expand the diagnostic capacity of a first-generation diagnostic assay to create a fully comprehensive test that can detect a drug-resistant UTI in minutes.<br/><br/>The proposed SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a dual-enzyme trigger-enabled cascade technology (DETECT), developed to detect low-abundant beta-lactamases produced by uropathogens to hydrolyze beta-lactamase antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. The presence of beta-lactamase-producing uropathogens can greatly complicate clinical decision-making because these pathogens are regularly resistant to the first-line antibiotics considered for treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). DETECT, applied as a diagnostic system, holds the potential to significantly improve the care of UTIs because it enables rapid identification of beta-lactamase-producing uropathogens directly from urine samples. The clinical feasibility of the technology has been demonstrated previously using clinical urine samples, first targeting a subset of beta-lactamases known as CTX-Ms. The proposed work aims to tune and optimize the first-generation system to offer a comprehensive diagnostic test that can accurately identify all of the clinically important beta-lactamases.

The identity of the initial colonizers of these habitats, subsequent invaders, and the repeatability of this process is important for understanding the establishment of ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling. Identifying steps in habitat maturation also shapes conservation strategies for endangered species and rare environments. These processes are virtually unknown in the anchialine ecosystem, which consists of coastal, landlocked bodies of water influenced by fresh and oceanic waters. Anchialine habitats are rare worldwide but are concentrated in Hawaii. Hawaiian anchialine habitats are home to a diverse array of animals, plants, and microbes, many of which are found nowhere else. In 2018 lava flows from the Kilauea volcano created several new anchialine habitats on the east coast of Hawaii, presenting an exceptional chance to examine how ecology emerges in the anchialine ecosystem. The researchers will leverage this opportunity to detail how these unusual habitats change over time. Microbial and animal communities will be characterized as they become established.

Underrepresented groups in STEM (including native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders) will take an active role in this research.     <br/><br/>Hundreds of microbial samples will be collected during a time series in anchialine habitats undergoing development.

How to improve the satisfaction of these applications as perceived subjectively by end-users, widely interpreted as the quality of experience (QoE), is critical to the operators of wireless networks. Prevailing QoE enhancement methods are mostly operator-oriented, while users play somewhat limited roles. On the other hand, mobile devices are equipped with multiple embedded sensors that enable the collection and inference of rich contextual information. Motivated by these observations, this project aims to leverage user-centric context sensing to enhance QoE in wireless networks. The proposed user-assisted QoE enhancement, if successful, has the potential to serve as a promising complement to the existing centralized QoE management framework. Besides, it will open up new opportunities that incorporate mobile users for network measurement and management that has been mostly conducted by network operators alone. The project plans to engage female and under-represented minority students in the research activities and actively outreach to middle and high school students. The scholarly discovery will be disseminated broadly to the community.<br/><br/>This project intends to develop a practical framework to leverage context sensing for QoE enhancement and address critical challenges involved therein. More specifically, the proposed research will be carried out through three closely related research thrusts. The first thrust studies fine-granular user context prediction based on historical records harvested from mobile devices. As another key ingredient, it further investigates how to utilize the prediction results to assist with resource provisioning and QoE improvement in wireless networks. Realizing that context sensing may incur extra communication and energy overhead, the second thrust intends to reduce the cost by developing cost-efficient context sampling and accurate reconstruction that adapt to context dynamics. The third thrust addresses the privacy concern during context sensing. A flexible context trading framework will be developed to allow individual users to decide how much privacy to disclose in the trade of QoE improvement. The proposed research is inter-disciplinary, which spans resource management, learning techniques, compressive sensing, differential privacy, and economic theories. The proposed mechanisms and designs will be thoroughly evaluated via a combination of measurement campaigns, simulations, and experimental studies. A medium-scale prototype of off-the-shelf mobile devices, routers, servers, and cloud will be implemented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This insight is being applied to deposits of the Spanish Pyrenees ? a system with robust basin-scale sediment-flux constraints ? as a field calibration exercise. Subsequently, the developed approaches can help quantitatively test hypotheses about sediment-supply changes that occurred in response to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum climate-change event.

HCQ may provide a treatment option for COVID-19; however, the pandemic already appears to be disrupting the global pharmaceutical supply, which may cause shortages of this and other important medicines in the United States. Shortages of medicines occur in part because the domestic drug supply chain has become longer, more complex, and fragmented. The United States has sophisticated chemicals and pharmaceutical manufacturing capability, but many key raw materials and/or intermediates are manufactured elsewhere in the world. Less complicated markets could respond to a shortage by increasing production, but logistical challenges ? especially the complexity of the supply chain ? limit the ability of domestic drug manufacturers to easily increase production. Although the United States ranks second in global chemicals exports, much of its manufacturing capacity is unable to be readily leveraged to address anticipated shortfalls because there is no clear map of production requirements or domestic manufacturing capacity that is capable of meeting these requirements. HCQ will be ?mapped? as an example case, with the potential to refine and apply the same methodology even more rapidly to other compounds of value to the public in treating COVID-19 or for application to other diseases or emergent challenges. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a systematic ontology - and more specifically, a knowledge graph ? of HCQ production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in hydroxycloroquine (HCQ). The project plans to start with HCQ, but the methodology should be readily applicable to other molecules such as Remdesivir or Favipiravir (which have also been proposed as potential COVID-19 therapies). In partnership with Procter & Gamble, the project will leverage an Authoritative System Knowledge (ASK) chemical systems approach, as well as data and resources from the ?M-Print? open knowledge network Phase I Convergence Accelerator project (1937017). The ASK methodology is currently used by industry and government organizations to manage electromechanical systems manufacturing and other processes, but tools such as these are not yet widely used in the chemicals industry. The project team hypothesizes that suppliers of necessary source materials and intermediates in the US and abroad can be identified, and more importantly that the chemical transformations required for the HCQ process could be retooled within American facilities if that were a desirable outcome to ensure robust supply. To test the specific hypothesis that US manufacturing of HCQ could be optimized to minimize global supply chain challenges, the team will develop a model approach that uses raw materials available in the U.S., including the production requirements to transform these raw materials into HCQ.

One of the most critical questions is determining who is infected to help understand how rapidly the outbreak has progressed. With the continuing mismatch between testing need and capacity, alternative methods are needed to assess the outbreak. Further difficulty in monitoring the outbreak results from the fact that most infected individuals do not show COVID-19 symptoms immediately. These issues limit the ability of decision makers to determine where outbreaks are occurring within their communities, when outbreaks start, and when outbreaks slow or stop. The goal of this project is to address such limitations by developing the science behind monitoring the spread of the disease through community wastewater surveillance. To achieve this goal, the research will measure SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the wastewater system. This new detection method will allow for decision makers to assess potential outbreaks before symptomatic people request testing. In addition, results will help determine which communities have infected individuals. This is particularly important to assess whether the COVID-19 outbreak is slowing in response to interventions.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine the onset, duration, termination, and location of the COVID-19 outbreak via wastewater surveillance. This work will test two hypotheses that: 1) SARS-CoV2 virus RNA concentrations in sewage and stormwater correlates with the initiation, progression, and decline of a community?s aggregate COVID-19 infection; 2) Spatial sampling within a sewer system network can isolate the location of COVID-19 hotspots within a given community. To test these hypotheses, two objectives will be completed: 1) SARS-CoV2 RNA in four Clean Water Services (CWS, Washington County, Oregon) wastewater treatment facilities and stormwater collection systems will be quantified using reverse transcriptase droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) on a weekly basis. In the wastewater treatment plants, SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified in liquid primary clarifier effluent and in primary clarifier solids. At stormwater collection systems, SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified from the liquid and solid fractions. 2) SARS-CoV2 RNA will be quantified using RT-ddPCR at 12 selected sampling points throughout the CWS sewer system network on a biweekly basis through June, 2020, and monthly for the remainder of the project. The results will be incorporated into a GIS system containing publicly available demographic databases to identify COVID-19 hotspots and possible underlying contributing factors. The results of this work will demonstrate the feasibility of using wastewater collected at a centralized treatment facility to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks for an entire community. A second outcome of this work will determine how SARS-CoV2 RNA partitions between wastewater solids and liquid factions. Additionally, this work will determine if stormwater is a potential reservoir of SARS-CoV2 RNA during a COVID-19 outbreak.  Finally, this work will demonstrate how sampling throughout a sewer line network can identify COVID-19 outbreak hotspots. If successful, this research could lead to other similar monitoring efforts for other viral outbreaks and protect the public health of the Nation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Funerals are vital to the social health of a community. They allow people to grieve together and remember their deceased, but when the bereaved are not permitted to gather physically, communal mourning becomes more complicated. Therefore, understanding forms of adapted, and accepted, virtual (online) rituals and memorials and their role in preventing infection spread is paramount for addressing future surges of COVID-19 across the United States, as well as for future epidemics. Preliminary research with religious leaders and funeral home directors suggests that social distancing mandates that interrupt funeral, burial, and memorial practices have met with confusion and even resistance. This study will provide key information for the development of public health programs and guidelines that address the risks facing communities that continue to conduct in-person rituals. Given the social importance of funerals and the central role of mourning in the pandemic, communities urgently need to promote practices that preserve the cultural and religious significance of such rites but do not exacerbate viral transmission. The project also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.<br/> <br/>The study comes at a time when the rate of COVID-19 infections is at risk of rising exponentially and funeral capacity is being overwhelmed. The investigators thus seek to identify factors that enable or inhibit people?s ability to follow social distancing guidelines that interrupt or run counter to obligations of care for the dead. As research on the Ebola crisis demonstrated, anthropologists? focus on the local perspectives of grieving communities provided crucial insights into the factors that reduced or heightened the risk of infection, and thus played an important role in public health interventions. In collaboration with diverse religious communities, funeral practitioners, and representatives from the National Funeral Directors Association, the study will assess how religious tradition (or lack thereof) influences the adaptation of funeral rites, and how COVID-19-related constraints on funeral care shift the burden of organizing collective mourning onto the family and into virtual spaces. The project incorporates a range of methodological approaches aimed at capturing in real time these adaptive processes, including virtual participant observation (e.g., synchronous religious rites, and funeral and memorial services), initial and follow-up semi-structured interviews, discourse analysis of digital media, and survey instruments. The researchers will pay special attention to variations in access to virtual media. Because rituals reflect the capacity for communities, whether religious or secular, to marshal material and symbolic resources, they illuminate how structural inequalities create disparities across communities and generations. The study thus contributes foundational knowledge to the social analysis of death marked in virtual space, broadening our understanding of the interconnected roles of media, technology, and religion and during times of crisis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mitigating these losses by even a few percent would have a major impact on our ability to abundantly produce clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing these losses requires untangling the complexities of wind farm flow behavior.  Wind farms typically consist of 10s or 100s of turbines, with rotating blades creating wakes that mix and interact, affected by terrain and atmospheric behavior across many scales.  Vortex particle methods have been demonstrated to be an effective approach for simulating wake-dominant flows in adjacent fields (e.g., rotorcraft) and can potentially offer insight into wind farm flow fields at much faster computational speeds compared to traditional methods.  However, efficiently propagating vortex particles around viscous walls (e.g., terrain, other turbines) remains a challenge that is a focal point of this proposal.  The fundamental methodology could potentially be useful in other wake-dominant flow fields like simulating aircraft, underwater vehicles, the motion of water or smoke around other objects, etc. The project will also facilitate the development of a learn-by-doing platform to introduce students to computational aerodynamics?like a Codecademy® for aerodynamics.<br/><br/>The viscous vortex particle method is based on solving the vorticity form of the Navier-Stokes equations, and, using a meshless Lagrangian scheme, which can accurately preserve vortical structures and improve computational efficiency by placing particles only where needed. The first objective is to extend the methodology to allow for efficient propagation of particles around viscous walls.  The second objective is to leverage the speed of the proposed methodology to create a new analytical wake model appropriate for mixed height wind farms. Recent work has demonstrated that mixed height wind farms have the potential for a significant increase in power production.  Existing analytical wake models are often not appropriate for these scenarios as they do not include important coupling effects such as mixing and entrainment.  So, the third objective is to conduct broad sensitivity studies to identify the most relevant parameters and strategies to mitigate the negative effects of partial waking. Wind turbines often encounter incoming wakes over just a portion of the rotor disk causing asymmetric loading and potentially increased fatigue damage and noise. The proposed methodology provides a good balance between capturing the fidelity in flow physics with prediction speed to enable a robust exploration of wake interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to a threat such as COVID-19, their mission requires the communication of accurate and credible information to local populations using a variety of media channels. Increasingly, social media is a critical component of their communication toolbox - but using it to rapidly and effectively inform the public in a crowded media environment remains a significant challenge.  In prior work on online communication associated with the Zika and Ebola outbreaks, the PIs established that effective messaging depended upon employing a combination of content, style, and structure features - but that the right mix seemed to depend upon properties of the disease event (including the uncertainty and ambiguity of the threat, the nature of the consequences involved, and the need for public information).  COVID-19 poses a distinct risk profile, with a disruption potential to the American public and the built environment not seen by any threat within decades.  This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will identify the key drivers of effective messaging in an emerging pandemic, and strategies for improving effectiveness in social media communication involving COVID-19 by public agencies.  The specific focus will be on the outcomes of message retransmission (essential for both high levels of message penetration and ensuring multiple exposures critical for behavioral influence) and engagement (a critical indicator of attention and a driver of trust), both of which are measurable and established as core outcomes in prior studies of effective social media communication.  By establishing evidence-based guidance for agencies to effectively warn, inform, and engage the general public during an emerging pandemic, this project will provide critical guidance needed to mount effective interventions that save lives, reduce economic losses, and protect the security of the nation against health threats, in alignment with the broader mission of the NSF.<br/><br/>This objective will be pursued through the following core activities: (1) collection of perishable social media data on COVID-19 messaging by public agencies, and public engagement with/retransmission of those messages; (2) content coding of COVID-19 messages, to typologize information that is specific to the present event; (3) characterization of messaging strategies used by public agencies in the evolving COVID-19 response; (4) predictive analysis of message outcomes based on message context, content, style, and structure; and (5) development of evidence-based guidance for effective social media messaging by public agencies in response to this and similar events.  This research strategy builds on successful prior work in response to emergent infectious disease threats and in the context of anthropogenic and natural hazard events.  The intellectual merit of the research includes: Risk communication messages on social media are real time traces of online in/formal communication shared under conditions of imminent and ongoing threat; Research on communication and messaging dynamics online provides insights into the social amplification of risk, via diffusion of information; and strategies to design effective messages. This project will test the risk communication on social media model in response to a global pandemic by analyzing official communication from state, local, and national public health and emergency management Twitter accounts.  The findings from this work will lead to the further development and refinement of the social amplification of risk framework and the risk communication on social media model.   The broader impacts of this work most prominently include the accumulation of an evidence base for social media messaging, as noted above.  This research will have immediate benefits to organizations and agencies tasked with communicating to at risk populations about emergent infectious disease in the context of the built environment. Our findings will inform the design and dissemination of risk communication messages and will be immediately applicable to public health and safety organizations in the context of COVID-19. Results will be shared via fact sheets, webinars, published papers, and presentations with academic and practitioner audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While human coronaviruses are highly infective and responsible for the majority of respiratory tract infections, the novel SARS-CoV2 is particularly virulent. These viruses can survive under a variety of conditions and environments including within human waste streams. Wastewater treatment systems are widely used as a final barrier to protect water bodies from the impacts of human pollution. However, the fate of coronaviruses during the wastewater treatment process is poorly understood. The goal of this RAPID project is to develop a science-based understanding of the fate of SARS-CoV2 and other viruses during the treatment of human waste in wastewater treatment plants. Results of this research will inform the scientific community and relevant stakeholders of the impact of waste treatment on SARS-CoV2, as well as other potential threats and agents. If successful, this approach will provide urgently needed information to help respond to the current global pandemic and form the basis of a global database for future pandemic events. <br/><br/>This proposal addresses a current pressing need to understand the abundance, activity and transmission of SARS-CoV2 and other viral determinants in engineered wastewater treatment systems. The emergence of increasingly frequent and especially potent microbial pathogens like SARS-CoV2 presents an urgent challenge to public health. The extremely rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as an asymptomatic latency period in subjects suggests significant gaps in our understanding of potential reservoirs and transmission pathways of SARS-CoV2. One such reservoir and potential transmission pathway is the engineered wastewater cycle. Wastewater treatment serves to reduce pollution and minimize exposure of human populations to microbiological threats. The goal of this project is to determine if wastewater treatment systems serve as a reservoir in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This will be achieved by conducting a worldwide environmental surveillance study using massively parallel high-throughput systems biology approaches to characterize viral structure-function-activity measures in the engineered wastewater cycle. The results of this study will provide a database of SARS-CoV2 and other viruses in a broad spectrum of waste streams, treatment systems, and disinfection processes. A second aim of this research is to develop -omics based biomarkers and quantitative assays for SARS-CoV2 to track fate in engineered wastewater treatment systems. Successful completion of this research will provide urgently needed information on SARS-CoV2 behavior in the environment that will inform efforts to manage and mitigate the impacts of the global pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These studies are to be undertaken in classrooms at the University of Utah as well as at a diverse set of partner institutions. The goal is to ultimately develop tools and pedagogical methods to help novices become more like experts (specifically, by writing code that follows known discourse rules). In particular, the project will determine how to better help undergraduate students learn to write code that is easy for others to read, maintain, test, and debug. When undergraduate students learn to program, they mostly focus on what the code does. However, in professional settings, it is crucial that code not just work, but also be easy for others to read and maintain. This project will (1) investigate which coding patterns that harm readability or maintainability are common among undergraduate students; (2) develop an automated system for detecting these patterns; (3) explore how practice and instruction on these patterns can help students learn to write code that is more readable. This research aims to improve undergraduate computer science education and promote workforce development.<br/><br/>This project will investigate code structures within individual methods that violate commonly-accepted discourse rules for programming (e.g., repeating code within an if-block and its corresponding else-block rather than factoring out the common steps). This project will survey educators and practitioners to determine which discourse rule violations are important to them, and will see which patterns are common in students' code. Students will be surveyed to examine their perceptions of code readability. Written assessments will determine how students' preferences are related to their abilities to comprehend, write, and edit code. This project will develop a tool to detect the target patterns with static and dynamic analysis.

Extensive and immediate testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic people is known to be important for implementing containment policies and to ensure that medical resources can be apportioned to different geographic regions appropriately. Individual testing can provide the necessary information; however, this requires enormous amounts of medical and human resources. This project will facilitate widespread testing for COVID-19 while using fewer tests. The main approach is based on the idea of pooling samples from multiple patients and performing tests on combined samples. If the result of a test is negative, one can conclude that no one in the pool is infected, and if the result is positive, then further fine-grained testing can be performed. Pooling-based testing, also known as group testing, can be very effective in reducing the number of tests required for both identifying infected people in a population and for obtaining coarse-grained population-level information about infection rates. In this project, effective group-testing schemes that minimize the total number of tests required and/or the total time taken to conduct tests will be designed, and their performance will be analyzed. <br/><br/>In this project, group-testing schemes that do not require precise knowledge of the infection rates and multi-stage group-testing schemes will be designed and optimized. The trade-off between the number of tests required and the total time taken to complete testing will also be characterized. The robustness of group-testing schemes to correlation in the infection status among the tested population and to errors in the tests will be studied. Using mathematical tools from group testing and hypothesis testing, strategies for rapid classification of infection rates will also be designed and analyzed. Finally, a smart-phone application which guides laboratory technicians through the group-testing process will be developed. The focus will be on small pool sizes and population sizes.

To maintain water quality and assure the safety of the public, it is necessary to rapidly monitor the presence of pathogens and analyze their potential risks. However, current approaches to quantify pathogens are typically focused on only one type of pathogen and cannot reliably provide quantitative risk information in a timely manner. The proposed research consists of a novel approach to rapidly assess health risks caused by the presence of a wide variety of pathogens determined from easy to measure water quality parameters. If successful, this research can lead to a same day assessment of the potential risks associated with contaminated water to protect the health of the public. Additional benefits to society will result from educating high school students, the public, and water quality professionals through outreach and training, thus increasing the understanding of water quality and disease. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to establish rapid microbiological water quality and risk assessment tools for water management. The central hypothesis is that the concentration of a pathogen can be expressed as a function of fecal indicator (FI), microbial source tracking (MST) markers, and environmental parameters. Pathogen concentrations will be used to assess potential human health risks by quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The specific objectives of this research are to (1) simultaneously quantify major waterborne pathogens (bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens) as well as FI and MST markers in water samples, (2) create and validate models to predict pathogen concentrations from FI and MST marker data, and (3) establish a QMRA workflow targeting multiple pathogens. While there are numerous models to predict FI from environmental parameters, only limited attempts have been made to predict concentrations of pathogens due to the lack of comprehensive data sets. This research will take advantage of the high-throughput quantitative PCR technology to collect large data sets of pathogens, FI, and MST marker concentrations. As a result of this research, utilities, public health professionals, water quality managers, and other stakeholders will be able to rapidly assess water quality and prevent disease outbreaks without specialized skills and costly equipment. To increase broader impacts, this project proposes a comprehensive plan that will (1) involve undergraduate and high school students in environmental research, (2) conduct outreach activities at local farmer?s markets and at the Minnesota State Fair, and (3) organize a qPCR and QMRA workshop for managers of local wastewater treatment plants and recreational beaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During a key step in the viral lifecycle, infected human cells release not only virus particles but also enzymes that cut viral and host proteins, called proteases. Detection of the proteases linked to SARS-CoV-2 would provide an alternative path for testing for COVID-19. With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Drs. Sankaran Thayumanavan, Jeanne Hardy, and Trisha L. Andrew at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst to develop ""smart"" sampling swabs whose color changes when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is present. The color change of the swab results when the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 breaks down a colorless, protein-derived molecule into individual pieces, with one of those pieces having its chemical properties changed during the break-down process, so that it absorbs or produces light that can be seen by the human eye. The investigators design and make the protein-derived probe molecules and then incorporate them into the fibers of currently-used clinical swabs. Their chemical design allows the probe molecules to be selectively broken down by the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and to produce strong color in the smart swabs even when extremely low concentrations of the main protease are present. Creation of the necessary chemical reactions and their application to develop the protease-responsive smart swabs may lead to inexpensive testing methods that are practical for use by individuals at home. Due to the generality of the release of proteases in the lifecycle of viral infections, the new chemical reactions and resulting technologies are anticipated to be useful for visual detection of other viruses, which may be especially meaningful during future potential outbreaks. Educational, training, and outreach activities focus on graduate students working with Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew in a cross-cutting, team-oriented research environment to address the development of front-line measurement science approaches, with anticipated highlights shared with the public and K-12 students about their experiences and lessons learned about how research funding can be used to directly impact a major societal crisis.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop rapid, accurate, straightforward probe-based sensors that detect the inherent catalytic properties of viral protease enzymes, which produce a clear optical readout. Efforts are focused on creating new sensing chemistries that utilize specifically designed dye-based reporters and using them to develop inexpensive, disposable smart swabs to detect the presence of catalytically-active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease (CoV2-MP). The general research approach Drs. Thayumanavan, Hardy, and Andrew take is to first generate protease recognition elements by designing, producing, and validating peptides that provide the optimal specificity to the targeted viral protease. The resulting protease recognition elements are then linked to donor-acceptor chromophores to create ""pro-chromophoric"" probes that remain in a dark (uncolored, discolored, or quenched) state. Upon exposure to the main viral protease, the free reporter is liberated and produces a highly intense colorimetric or fluorescence signal, with the estimated limits of detection offering sensing of sub-picomolar concentrations of CoV2-MP. Sophisticated reporter formulations with integrated chemical amplification routes are predicted to provide access to these limits of detection. Importantly, the protease-based detection strategy and swab test platform are easily and generally transferable for detecting potential future viral pathogens based on their specific protease structures.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MWA is especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, due to tumor location or poor health. All currently available MWA systems are only capable of producing a roughly spherical or teardrop-shaped treatment zone centered on the axis of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors located near critical anatomy or irregularly shaped targets. This limitation often leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications. Directional MWA would allow the physician to instead place the applicator alongside the tumor and direct heat toward the target and away from nearby sensitive tissues. New clinical techniques enabled by directional MWA could facilitate faster, safer, more effective, and lower cost treatment of localized tumors, and potentially broaden the range of diseases that could be treated in a minimally invasive manner.<br/><br/>As microwave antennas typically require physically large structures to achieve a high degree of directivity, developing a small diameter (<2.0 mm) applicator suitable for minimally invasive treatments is technically challenging and requires the use of novel design methods, fabrication processes, and materials. Technical work in this Phase II projects includes: 1) Industrialized design of the prototype ablation applicator and transmission cable hub, and associated fabrication and assembly process development to improve quality and clinical usability;  2) Testing and characterization of clinical delivery parameters, and developing an algorithm that informs treatment planning for the creation of customizable treatment zones;  3) Development of a programmable multi-channel MW generator platform, affording customizable control of energy delivery parameters, and 4) Detailed system integration and in vivo system performance assessment and characterization to develop treatment planning and dosing guidelines. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and in vivo experiments in porcine liver and kidney to design, optimize, and validate our applicators and integrated microwave ablation system. The goal of this R&D effort is to complete the technical design of a clinically viable directional microwave ablation system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

That question is especially urgent since national and regional authorities are facing scientific uncertainty and fast-moving events that cross geopolitical borders, and the need for quick action stands in tension with the need to ground policy in robust expert knowledge and convincing analysis. Ways of identifying trustworthy sources of expertise is essential, but they remain largely vested in governments with their differing institutions, research traditions, cultural commitments, and civic beliefs. The PIs will conduct a multi-sited investigation in ten regions that will capture detailed information about the COVID 19 crisis as it unfolds, and then conduct a rigorous comparative analysis to provide a better understanding of the relationship between expertise and trust, a critically important nexus for policy makers in an era of decentralized information and polarized politics. Effective dissemination of results to critical policy analysts and policy communities is key to the success of this project. To achieve this goal, the PIs will utilize the extensive connections that they and their collaborative partners have to science policymakers and national and international organizations.<br/><br/>The PIs have assembled a team of research partners, well established STS scholars in ten regions, who have agreed to participate in the project. This team will collect and analyze publications and public documents pertaining to COVID-19 policy making in each region. These materials will provide the basis for STS-based accounts of knowledge and policymaking in each region for the comparisons that are central to this project. To provide that account, they will build a basic policy timeline tracking key events and decisions in each region?s response to the pandemic. Tracking these moves will enable them to document change and analyze variations in how issues are framed and evidence is gathered. They will also collect information on uncertainties (such as scope and limitations of scientific knowledge) and controversies, with a focus on the most contentious aspect of coronavirus policy in each region. In addition, they will track carefully chosen objects as they are incorporated into policy discussions.

A recent study has shown that these virions can be airborne for at least 30 minutes and be active on the aerosol droplets up to three hours.  Non-pharmaceutical protection is essential to stunt the spread of this virus. As of March 19, 2020, the Center for Disease Control?s official guidelines include non-optimal reuse of surgical masks for extended periods of time.

The reuse of masks puts healthcare workers, first line responders, patients, and the community at risk. The aim of this research project between the University of Texas-Austin and the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital is to develop and implement a rapid protocol for extended use of surgical and N95 masks.  The researchers will develop a fast, simple procedure for turning passive masks into active protective gear.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses a critical need to improve personal protection equipment during the coronavirus crisis. A new extended use protocol for masks will render immediate benefits to the healthcare community.

Not much is known about how Antarctica?s ice sheets might respond to ongoing and future warming, but such knowledge is important because Antarctica?s ice sheets might raise global sea levels significantly with continued melting. Over time, mud accumulates on the sea floor around Antarctica that is composed of the skeletons and debris of microscopic marine organisms and sediment from the adjacent continent. As this mud is deposited, it creates a record of past environmental and ecological changes, including ocean depth, glacier advance and retreat, ocean temperature, ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, ocean chemistry, and continental weathering. Scientists interested in understanding how Antarctica?s glaciers and ice sheets might respond to ongoing warming can use a variety of physical, biological, and chemical analyses of these mud archives to determine how long ago the mud was deposited and how the ice sheets, oceans, and marine ecosystems responded during intervals in the past when Earth?s climate was warmer. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida, University of Massachusetts, and Northern Illinois University will reconstruct the depth, ocean temperature, weathering and nutrient input, and marine ecosystems in the central Ross Sea from ~17 to 13 million years ago, when the warm Miocene Climate Optimum transitioned to a cooler interval with more extensive ice sheets. Record will be generated from new sediments recovered during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374 and legacy sequences recovered in the 1970?s during the Deep Sea Drilling Program. Results will be integrated into ice sheet and climate models to improve the accuracy of predictions. The research provides experience for three graduate students and seven undergraduate students via a multi-institutional REU program focused on increasing diversity in Antarctic Earth Sciences. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Deep-sea sediments reveal that the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) was the warmest climate interval of the last ~20 Ma, was associated with global carbon cycle changes and ice growth, and immediately preceded the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; ~14 Ma), one of three major intervals of Antarctic ice expansion and global cooling. Ice-proximal studies are required to assess: where and when ice grew, ice sheet extent, continental shelf geometry, high-latitude heat and moisture supply, oceanic and/or atmospheric temperature influence on ice dynamics, regional sea ice extent, meltwater input, and regions of bottom water formation. Existing studies indicate that ice expanded beyond the Transantarctic Mountains and onto the prograding Ross Sea continental shelf multiple times between ~17 and 13.5 Ma. However, these records are either too ice-proximal/terrestrial to adequately assess ocean-ice interactions or under-studied. To address this data gap, this work will: 1) generate micropaleontologic and geochemical records of oceanic and atmospheric temperature, water depth, ocean circulation, and paleoproductivity from existing Ross Sea marine sedimentary sequences, and 2) use these proxy records to test the hypothesis that dynamic glacial expansion in the Ross Sea sector during the MCO was driven by heat and moisture transport to the high latitudes during an interval of enhanced climate sensitivity. Downcore geochemical and micropaleontologic studies will focus on an expanded (120 m/my) early to middle Miocene (~17-16 Ma) diatom-bearing/rich mudstone/diatomite unit from IODP Site U1521, drilled on the Ross Sea continental shelf. A hiatus (~16-14.6 Ma) suggests ice expansion during the MCO, followed by diamictite to mudstone unit indicative of slight retreat (14.6 -14 Ma) immediately preceding the MMCT. Data from Site U1521 will be integrated with foraminiferal geochemical and micropaleontologic data from DSDP Leg 28 (1972/73) and RISP J-9 (1978-79) to develop a MCO to late Miocene regional view of ocean-ice sheet interactions using legacy core material previously processed for foraminifera. This integrated record will: 1) document the timing and extent of glacial advances and retreats across the prograding Ross Sea shelf during the middle and late Miocene, 2) provide orbital-scale paleotemperature reconstructions (TEX86, Mg/Ca, ?18O, MBT/CBT) to establish atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions during an extreme high-latitude warm interval, and 3) provide orbital-scale nutrient/paleoproductivity, ocean circulation, and paleoenvironmental data required to assess climate feedbacks associated with Miocene Antarctic ice sheet and global climate system development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach eschews explicit location tracking, instead using granular signal monitoring techniques at mobile phones to infer the physical proximity of pairs of phones.  The work will also respect user privacy, by giving users control over the data the system collects, in three ways: first, the data the system collects will be stored on the mobile phone itself, second, users will be empowered to clear that data from their phones, or opt-out of the system entirely, and third, each step of the traceback will occur with individual user consent.  This automated and highly specific traceback will advance the national health and secure the national defense, both speeding up the process of contact traceback and extending the utility of contact traceback into the latter stages of a pandemic when the goal is to delay and lower daily infection rates.  From a societal standpoint, the work aims to engage cellular chipset manufacturers, cellular network providers, and state and national health authorities in the national COVID-19 mitigation effort.<br/><br/>CoV-2-Traceback enables approaches that mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 by automating the identification and traceback of recent significant risk contacts of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case.  Instead of relying on GPS, which does not work well indoors and in many urban settings, signal processing algorithms examine the cellular control channel to determine whether and for how long other people are proximal to a confirmed positive case.  Current medical knowledge indicates that the riskiest exposures involve both time and proximity of contact, but there is a challenge in identifying such exposures with a high specificity that existing technology does not yet meet.  The project develops a traceback protocol that resolves a newly-diagnosed user's phone identifiers and then submits phone identifies meeting the foregoing proximity criteria to cellular providers, so they can identify close contacts of the newly-diagnosed case.  As COVID-19 surveillance efforts ramp up in each state, the project will leverage state- and county-level background infection rates to validate CoV-2-Traceback's accuracy.  Comparing with traditional methods for contact tracing, it will also quantify whether the approach is indeed more specific, flagging fewer patients who in the end turn out to be COVID-19 negative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cleaning workers wear different levels of personal protection ranging from simple surgical masks to professional high efficiency filtration masks. Depending on the mask type, cleaning process, surfaces, and disinfectants used, cleaning workers can be exposed to disinfection byproducts that form as a result of reactions between disinfectants, the surfaces being cleaned, and the mask materials. This project will quantify inhalation of disinfection byproducts during disinfection while wearing different classes of masks and use this information to make recommendations on which mask to wear and how often to change or clean the mask or mask components. These data are directly relevant to the current worldwide COVID-19 crisis and similar future pandemic challenges. The core project team includes at least three graduate research assistants, one postdoctoral scholar, and five professors with different backgrounds and at different stages of their careers. Thus, a further impact of this project will be advancing education and training the next generation of scientists and engineers in techniques to respond to pandemic challenges. <br/><br/>This project consists of a two-phase approach to address potential health threats to cleaning workers resulting from the large-scale use of disinfection in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the first phase is to define possible concentration ranges of chemicals that flow through personal protection masks based on: 1) the type of disinfectant used; 2) the application process (e.g. wiping, spraying, or fogging); 3) chemical processes forming byproducts (such as reaction of cleaning products on surfaces); 4) environmental conditions (such as ventilation/dilution rate); and 5) proximity of the cleaning worker to the chemical source. The goal of phase two is to characterize the inhalation of disinfection byproducts. A full-scale thermal manikin equipped with a nose and mouth breathing simulation system will be exposed to uniform concentrations of byproducts determined in phase one in an environmental chamber. Surface chemical reaction processes and kinetics will be studied with different masks and byproduct inhalation will be assessed via mass spectrometry. The manikin will be equipped with four different classes of masks: surgical mask, dust mask without exhalation relief valve, dust mask with exhalation relief valve, and professional mask. It is likely that some masks decrease inhalation exposure to disinfection byproducts while others increase exposure via adsorption of cleaning product vapors to the mask and by addition of moisture due to exhalation. These processes lead to a mask chemistry that produces additional chemical products whose concentration is much greater in the mask than in the ambient air. These secondary products are potentially more harmful than the primary vapors of cleaning products. Successful completion of this study will provide timely and critical data relevant to the current crisis by identifying risks for different types of masks and cleaning products.

As COVID-19 continues to spread, the effectiveness of different testing strategies and predictive models are brought into question. Testing strategies include the use of drive-through facilities that have found success elsewhere but may prove impractical for elderly and low-income sections of the population, and the use of hospitals, which adds further burden to the healthcare system and may carry the risk of higher contagion. Mathematical models that forecast the spread of the disease are of paramount importance to inform local and global policy makers on the course of action that should be undertaken to mitigate the outbreak and give relief to the population. However, such models are often confounded by the absence of symptoms in early stages, complex mobility patterns, and limited testing resources. This award supports fundamental research toward a mathematical model that will overcome these confounding factors, through advancements in dynamics and control. By explicitly modeling social and mobility constraints, this research will help increase the general well-being of communities and reduce disparities across the population. The model will afford the simulation of critical what-if scenarios and will include the evaluation of different testing policies and mitigation actions, thereby constituting a valuable support to policy makers involved in the containment and eradication of the epidemic.

It is particularly important to understand the social factors associated with this variability. This project builds on an ongoing longitudinal study of the life and relationship experiences of a large, diverse sample of young people interviewed first as adolescents, and subsequently interviewed multiple times as they have become adults. This provides an opportunity to interview these women and men to understand the process of navigating the guidelines, including: a) what factors predict more and less compliant responses to the social distancing guidelines; and b) what are the consequences of social distancing for emotional health, behavioral health, and relationship functioning. The findings of the project will alert researchers and policymakers to the myriad of personal and background characteristics that are associated with more or less compliance.  This information will allow for the crafting of more effective public policies and messaging about social distancing, with the goal of promoting faster and more complete compliance during future pandemics. <br/><br/>Social distancing is a vital tool in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, but we know little about who complies with guidelines and who does not.  This project will draw on six waves of previously collected survey data (n=1,321) from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study (TARS) and a new COVID-19 online survey that will be administered to all respondents. These longitudinal data provide a unique opportunity to examine precursors and consequences of variations in response to the current social distancing guidelines. The design also includes in-depth phone interviews with a subset of respondents who were compliant (n=25) and others who did not change behavior or failed to comply consistently (n=25). The qualitative component will provide help to understand compliance as a process, and develop insights about the role of social networks in either encouraging or minimizing the need to  comply. In addition to assessing the role of sociodemographic characteristics, the project will analyze the effects of prior adverse childhood and adolescent experiences, economic and social uncertainties, and network embeddedness as influences on levels of compliance. The availability of previous measures of social and behavioral health and prior relationship circumstances will allow the project to determine effects of social distancing and the experience of the pandemic, controlling for prior background. The project will also examine whether consistent reports of depression at prior waves exacerbate or dampen the effect of the recent experience of social distancing. The emphasis on social determinants provides a counterpoint to approaches that conceptualize compliance with health-promoting recommendations as an individualistic, largely cognitive process, and more broadly, will contribute to the emerging science of behavior change.

The energy conditions on these devices are not always satisfiable to initiate or maintain the mmWave links and require systems to be capable of anticipating communication failures and take preemptive actions to minimize energy expenditures. Fortunately, the environmental information provided by remote sensors contains sufficient knowledge to enable the design of such systems. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms and tools to exploit this information and augment the solar-harvesting remote invasive species monitoring system in the State of Hawaii with mmWave data delivery capability. The work in this project will enable researchers, industry, and students to realize high bandwidth real-time remote sensing with power-constrained devices in real-world applications. The results of this research will impact fields across scientific, industrial, and military interests, including agriculture, ecology, meteorology, infrastructure, and public utility monitoring, etc., where timely communication of high-resolution sensory data is essential.<br/><br/>The fundamental intuition of the proposed approach is that environmental factors, such as weather conditions, signal blockages, can be recognized via the inherent capability or interactions between the remote sensors. Knowledge of these factors can be utilized to optimize device awakening, beam scanning, and signal amplification, etc., at the physical layer. Three complimentary research thrusts are pursued: 1) extracting the correlation between solar harvesting conditions and mmWave signal attenuations; developing models and circuits to estimate the mmWave signal attenuations at specific solar conditions; 2) designing a distributed sensing architecture to detect mmWave beam blockage and accelerate beam alignment, by exploiting the low-power decimeter band communication implemented by the existing system; 3) formulating and solving a constrained route placement problem for an autonomous aerial data collector to optimize its mmWave signal reception as it maneuvers between sensor clusters and flight restricted regions.

In plants, photosynthetic energy conversion is realized by pigment-protein complexes that are harbored in highly specialized thylakoid membranes inside the chloroplasts. The dynamic response of the protein landscape in thylakoid membranes to unpredictable environmental changes (i.e. fluctuations in sunlight intensity by clouds, self-shading of leaves in wind) triggers photoprotective high-energy quenching (qE) that is essential for the survival of the plant. The project will map qE-induced protein landscape dynamics in thylakoid membranes with molecular resolution as a basis for understanding key photosynthetic functions. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that it defines an innovative and complete pipeline of methods, ranging from state-of the art electron microscopy to coarse grain computer simulations, which will provide a quantitative understanding of photosynthetic light harvesting and electron transport. This pipeline will lead to urgently needed insights into dynamic structure-function relationships in thylakoid membranes. Furthermore, it is raising protein landscape analysis to a new level with unprecedented resolution to increase our in-depth understanding of photosynthetic energy conversion. The broader impact of the project is twofold:  First, it will provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and establish a new computer-based teaching tool for a computational chemistry course. Second, social benefits of the proposed work are expected for the improvement of crop plants and biofuel prospects since it turns out that optimization and adjustment of the qE mechanisms by bioengineering could be a powerful tool to increase plant performances. <br/><br/>To generate high-resolution protein maps of the thylakoid protein landscape as basis to provide mechanistic understanding for the qE-dependent regulation of light-harvesting and electron transport, three specific aims will be pursued. Aim #1: Establishing high-resolution protein maps for different qE states. Plants will be examined using electron microscopy and compositional analysis which will lead to detailed coarse grain thylakoid protein landscapes. Aim #2: Determine how qE-induced changes in protein landscapes impact light harvesting and photoprotective qE. Coarse grain protein maps of thylakoid membranes will be used to model photosynthetic light harvesting in order to interpret measured data. Aim #3: Determine how qE-triggered switches in protein landscapes control diffusion dependent electron transport. A dynamic protein landscape model for the entire thylakoid membrane will be developed that allows simulation of the whole photosynthetic electron transport to understand in vivo data. <br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This cloud-hosted service democratizes access to advanced computing by providing intuitive interfaces for both registering remote computers as function executors and executing functions on these computers reliably, securely, and with high performance. Researchers can thus decompose monolithic applications into collections of reusable lightweight functions that can be run wherever makes the most sense, for example where data reside or where excess capacity is available. By simplifying access to specialized and high performance cyberinfrastructure and decreasing the time to discovery, the project serves the national interest, as stated in NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science. A total of 33 diverse science, cyberinfrastructure, and software institute partners working with cutting-edge science applications and research cyberinfrastructure will directly benefit from the funcX platform.<br/><br/>This project develops funcX, a scalable and high-performance federated platform for managing the remote execution of (often short-duration) functions across diverse cyberinfrastructure systems, from edge accelerators to clusters, supercomputers, and clouds. funcX allows developers to decompose applications into collections of functions that can each be executed in the best location, in terms of cost, execution time, data movement costs, and/or energy consumption. It thus integrates the extreme convenience of the function as a service (FaaS) model, developed in industry for specific industry applications, with support for the specialized needs of scientific research. funcX addresses important barriers to these new uses of research cyberinfrastructure systems, by enabling the intuitive, flexible, and scalable execution of functions without regard to physical location, scheduler architecture, virtualization technology, administrative domain, or data location. Flexible open-source funcX agent software makes it easy to expose arbitrary computing systems as funcX computing platforms, thereby transforming existing cyberinfrastructure systems into high-performance function serving environments (endpoints). The cloud-hosted funcX service provides a REST interface for registering functions, discovering available endpoints, and managing the execution of functions on endpoints, all via a universal trust fabric and standard web authentication and authorization mechanisms. It dynamically creates and deploys containers that incorporate function dependencies and provide a secure and isolated environment for safe function execution.

The impacts of the current outbreak are exacerbated by the potential for infection outbreaks to seasonally reoccur. This potential seasonal cycling presents a great challenge to the current clinic-based disease surveillance approach which does not adequately test asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. There is a critical need for alternative methods to assess spread, as undiagnosed infections are driving disease transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic. To directly address this need, this project will develop the science to assess community infection prevalence by analyzing the wastewater microbiome, promising a rapid, sensitive, and comprehensive approach for microbial disease surveillance. Successful development will allow assessment of infection rates in the population served by the wastewater treatment plant, including those with mild or no symptoms. Such capabilities would dramatically improve surveillance of pandemics by indicating in real time where the disease is emerging in new hotspots. Such information would inform intervention strategies for controlling  the current COVID-19 pandemic, and help the Nation manage future outbreaks more effectively. <br/><br/>This RAPID project has two specific research objectives in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The first objective is to develop and optimize a highly efficient concentration and detection method for enveloped viruses (like coronavirus) in the wastewater matrix. There is urgent need for this knowledge given that the most commonly used concentration methods for viruses in water samples were developed for the non-enveloped viruses. Successful completion of this phase of the research will thus fill a major technological gap and significantly advance the capability to detect and monitor the SARS-CoV2 in water and wastewater. The second objective  is to collect time-sensitive wastewater samples from communities impacted by the disease. The wastewater will be used to determine the abundance, diversity, and temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV2 and other enveloped viruses in the wastewater. These data will be analyzed to reconstruct the extent of COVID-19 community transmission. The research will generate much-needed information on community transmission of COVID-19, as well as serve to validate the wastewater-based surveillance approach. If successful, this research will provide a new avenue to protect the public health of the Nation through wastewater surveillance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research participation is linked to increased student persistence in STEM, especially for students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM.  Thus, by increasing the number and diversity of students who have a research experience, CURES also broaden participation in STEM careers.  CURES typically engage student teams in hands-on work in laboratories or field sites.  With the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, the national CURE education landscape quickly and dramatically changed to a fully ?online? mode, with limited opportunity for advance planning.  Thus, this situation presents a unique and urgent opportunity to explore how CUREs evolve in a new online environment, as well as whether they continue to achieve core CURE educational goals.  It also allows for assessment of whether these rapid course changes have equitable outcomes for all students, including first-generation students, students on financial aid, and from different socioeconomic backgrounds.  If CUREs are a solution for engaging large numbers of early-stage undergraduates in authentic STEM research, then the feasibility to translate CUREs online must be known.  It is important to understand the structure of these newly online CUREs, in what situation they are effective, and who they benefit.  The results of this project have the potential to expand understanding of CURE instructional approaches and outcomes, for both practitioners and researchers.  Additionally, this unexpected shift to online coursework is an opportunity to engage broader higher education audiences in new thinking about course configuration, online effectiveness, and supports and barriers for online teaching.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) capture and analyze how CURE course activities are rapidly translated into online formats; and 2) assess effects of course changes on students with different demographic profiles.  It will provide early evidence to answer if, how, and why CURE benefits are realized through the different modality of online teaching.  Importantly, this project will not make conclusions about the quality of online CUREs or online teaching overall; instead, it will explore which CURE activities can be readily delivered online, how they get delivered, how students respond, and how this new way of teaching changes/expands how instructors think about CUREs.  The present project will use a mixed-methods design to track online implementation of CURE courses in two samples.  The first sample will include a diverse set of local CUREs that span multiple STEM departments and have an array of course objectives/structures.  This collection of CUREs will afford an in-depth, qualitative case study investigation that will capture and analyze instructors? thinking, plans, and products, before, during, and after the shift from hands-on, laboratory-based CUREs to ones that are now abruptly online.  The second sample will include CURE courses from a national network, which will allow us to explore more broadly and in a more quantitative way, how a large number of instructors transitioned to online.  The project will also examine the resulting emotions, motivations, and experiences of students during this transition and how this semester?s student outcomes compare to those from prior years, through analysis of a historical student outcomes database.  This approach will provide broad reach and comparison among a relatively homogenous set of CUREs, since all CURE instructors in this network are trained in the same research approach, have similar course objectives, and use similar materials.

Critical to managing any pandemic is the accurate estimation of how many people are infected within communities. SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, is excreted in the stool of infected individuals, eventually ending up in the wastewater treatment plant. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human waste presents the opportunity to potentially monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the number of infections in the community and provide an ?early warning system? for future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The goal of this research is to develop methods to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and to connect these measurements to epidemiology models. In addition, the project team will coordinate wastewater monitoring efforts for SARS-CoV-2 globally. If successful, this research could lead to other similar monitoring efforts for other viral outbreaks and protect the health of the Nation. <br/> <br/>SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., 2019-nCoV) is identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness that is now a global  pandemic causing significant disruption to medical services and commerce. Significant uncertainties about the prevalence of this virus remain. This information which is vital to inform control recommendations and determine the case fatality rate. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool raises the possibility of using wastewater-based epidemiological approaches to estimate the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. In this approach, molecular quantification of SARS-CoV-2 will be combined with epidemiological data to model outbreak dynamics and estimate the overall prevalence of the virus in the community over time. These data will be integrated into epidemiological models using data from public health surveillance. Data from wastewater could inform epidemiological estimates on finer spatial scales than epidemiological data and could provide indications of continued community transmission following the initial wave of the pandemic. The potential for this virus to become a seasonally transmitted endemic pathogen like influenza and other coronaviruses would make this type of analysis increasingly informative. Technical developments resulting from this research include improved sample handling methods, molecular quantification approaches, integration of the resulting data into epidemiological models, as well as coordination with domestic and international collaborators to standardize methodology. There is significant scientific interest in using wastewater to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 beyond the current outbreak. This research will inform such efforts and help respond to future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

COVID-19 presents a national threat to the health of children and families, presenting serious implications for the mental and physical health of children. This project addresses two critical aspects of the impact on COVID-19 on families: (a) the large-scale shift to at-home learning based on nationwide school closures and (b) the critical need for families to understand the basic science of virus transmission and prevention. To address these needs, the project team will develop a series of STEM activities for families with children in grades K-6 that make use of items readily available in most households. The activities help children and their families learn about viruses, virus transmission, and virus prevention while also developing other STEM-skills, particularly related to engineering design. Importantly, the project team also considers the emotional well-being of children and families during the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. Led by researchers from Indiana University and Binghamton University, and experts in educational resource development from Science Friday (a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the public?s access to science and scientific information through podcasts, digital videos, original web articles, and educational resources for teachers and informal educators) the project is further supported by partnerships with the New York Hall of Science, Amazeum (AR), the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (ME), The Tech Museum of Innovation (CA), the Indiana State Museum, and Kopernik Observatory Science Center (NY). The activities will be shared with families through live-streamed web sessions that introduce the activity, give tips to adults for facilitation, share a bit on related STEM careers and engage the audience in dialog about the activity and their current experiences. Versions of the sessions that are recorded will be edited and include closed-captioning and subtitles in multiple languages before being posted on platforms such as YouTube. <br/><br/>This project uses a design-based research approach to investigate strategies for enabling families to actively engage with STEM while home and away from their traditional institutions during a period of crisis.   The research components focus on: 1) Engagement: How do families engage in the activity tasks, in terms of processes, practices, and use of resources? Who participated, why did they choose to participate and how did they engage (including modification of activities)? What barriers prevented interested families from completing activities?   2) Impact: How did the activities change participants? feelings of: a) efficacy around STEM and b) connectedness/ isolation, during extended school closures? and 3) the Activities: Which activities had the greatest uptake? How many activity ideas were submitted by those outside of the team? What was the age/content focus of each of these activities? The researchers will analyze social media data (including data on resource downloads and use of tracked links, YouTube and Facebook views, comment threads during livestreams and Likes/Shares/Follows across social media sites) to refine and improve the activities and programming as well as learn about the ways families are engaging in the activities. The researchers will solicit survey responses from website visitors to gather more information on participants, why they participated, how they engaged and how the activities impacted participants? efficacy around STEM and their feelings of connectedness or isolation. The researchers will also ask participants to submit images, videos and text that describes what they are making and their process along the way. Analysis of this data would lead to insights on how children and families use STEM language and practices; how children and families ask questions and use COVID-19-related and other information as part of their design work; and how ideas are formed, shaped and refined as families engage in design and making. While the project focuses on a unique opportunity to collect data on family STEM engagement as families respond to disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, this project and its findings will provide a knowledge base that can be utilized to inform future responses to national emergencies, other work aimed at promoting family learning at home, and approaches to supporting children in open-ended problem solving.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accurate forecasting of disease spread is a critical tool for effectively planning outbreak responses, allowing us to predict how many people will be infected, how many patients will be in hospitals at any given time, and the resource needs (e.g. ventilators) at each hospital. Most modeling studies of SARS-CoV-2 have so far focused on predicting how the virus will spread in densely populated cities like New York City, but the virus is also rapidly spreading in more sparsely populated, rural regions.  To accurately model outbreak dynamics in more rural areas, more realistic mathematical models are needed that can represent mid-sized population centers separated by large areas of low population density. This project will develop and refine these more advanced mathematical models to understand how population density and interconnectedness influence the trajectory of epidemic outbreaks. Importantly, the project will deploy model projections in near-real-time to aid in local public health interventions, via a secure web portal accessible to local and regional response planners. Model output will also be linked to the resources available at specific local and regional hospitals in a broad rural area, so that these hospitals can better manage the impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The modeling system and web application will serve as a framework for rapidly responding to future outbreaks. <br/><br/>Most epidemiological models that have been developed to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 make assumptions that are likely only realistic in dense urban centers, such as frequency-dependent transmission dynamics, a lack of stochastic processes, and a lack of density-dependent effects. In this project, models will be developed that are more appropriate for sparse metapopulations, accounting for multiple sources of stochasticity, population movement across a landscape, density-dependent transmission, and spatial heterogeneity in transmission rates. The project will use advanced statistical computing algorithms to fit the models to data from a large rural region. This fitting routine will identify the most appropriate transmission functions that describe longitudinal patterns of case-counts and will allow the project to release data-informed predictions of SARS-CoV-2 spread in near-real-time. These model forecasts will be developed in collaboration with public health experts and healthcare practitioners to respond to the needs of under-served, rural communities. The secure web application will provide predictions of hospitalization rates at fine spatial grains so that already strained, rural hospital systems can adapt and plan under different intervention scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This simple, static picture has served as a powerful conceptual framework to explain the existence of the band, know as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and its connection to the global atmospheric circulation and the energy balance of earth's climate. But the real-world ITCZ is not static, and while theories developed from the static picture can account for its north-south seasonal migration and longer-term shifts accompanying ice ages, they may lack key ingredients needed to explain short-term ITCZ variability.<br/><br/>Work performed here focuses specifically on the dynamics of short-term ITCZ fluctuations identified in a recent study of the Eastern Pacific in Northern Hemisphere Spring (Haffke et al 2016). The fluctuations include shifts from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere and splitting events in which a single ITCZ is replaced by a pair of convergence zones, one on either side of the equator.  The shifts and splits take place over the course of a few days and the project seeks to account for them in terms of changes in the winds of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL, the lowest kilometer or so of the atmosphere).  <br/><br/>The Principal Investigator (PI) hypothesizes that these fluctuations are driven by relatively subtle changes in the large-scale pressure gradients affecting the region of the ITCZ.  The pressure gradients lead to changes in the north-south component of the ABL winds near the equator, and the nonlinear advection of moisture and meridional momentum by these winds causes rapid ITCZ shifting or splitting.  This hypothesis is tested and explored through a combination of observational analysis, focused on the longitudinally averaged ABL momentum equation, and idealized computer simulations.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the work include educational activity conducted through Iowa State University's Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program targeted at middle and high school science teachers.  Teachers from central Iowa schools participate in research related to this project over six summer weeks and also participate in a seminar series and regular discussion group on the pedagogy of science teaching.

SARS-CoV-2 is also shed in stool despite patients testing negative, and thus it may reach wastewater treatment plants, where it could survive for days and be aerosolized or discharged in the effluent. In fact, there are reports that SARS-CoV-2 may spread through bathroom pipes.  Although coronaviruses can be inactivated by some conventional water treatment processes, there is an urgent need for more precise viral disinfection approaches that are fast, efficient and reliable under realistic scenarios. The objective of this project is to develop a novel approach for selective adsorption and photocatalytic disinfection (i.e., trap-and-zap) of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. This would result in a chemical-free technology (thus avoiding harmful disinfection byproducts) with unprecedented precision and reliable efficiency to inactivate coronavirus. The driving hypothesis is that molecular imprinting of graphitic carbon nitride with common coronavirus attachment factors will enable selective virus adsorption near reactive sites, resulting in reliably high disinfection. Whereas enhancing the capacity and resiliency of wastewater disinfection and hospital air sterilization systems to protect public health against emerging infectious diseases has significant intrinsic merit, the benefits of this project are much broader. This project will enhance surface recognition of various types of coronavirus (e.g., those causing COVID-19, MERS and SARS), which will inform efforts to concentrate them and improve both precision separation (e.g., by superior sorbents) and detection limits of sensors that can be used in diagnostics and surveillance efforts. Project results will be integrated into various courses, including the NanoEnvironmental Engineering for Teachers (NEET) course at Rice, which enrolls 15 teachers that reach over 3,300 high school students annually. This course recently expanded to Arizona State University and is also being expanded to the University of Texas at El Paso, thereby ensuring wide dissemination of this ?trap-and-zap? approach to STEM teachers.<br/><br/>This project builds on a recently published, nanotechnology-enabled ?trap-and-zap? approach (enhanced by molecular imprinting), to selectively adsorb antibiotic resistant genes and concentrate them near photocatalytic sites for efficient degradation (doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b06926). This approach will be modified to target SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus by imprinting molecules involved in virus attachment such as sialic acids, heparin sulfate proteoglycan, and angiotensin-converting enzyme?related carboxypeptidase (ACE2)-associated peptides onto the graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts. When the imprinted molecule is removed (e.g., by acid washing), it leaves behind a target-specific cavity that enables selective adsorption and photocatalytic inactivation with minimum interference by background water constituents. Low pathogenic coronavirus HCoV-NL63 (which, similarly to SARS-CoV 2, is enveloped with an S spike protein and uses the same cell surface molecule ACE2 as host receptor) will be used to assess adsorption kinetics and selectivity of molecularly imprinted-gC3N4 in the presence of competing proteins (such as bovine serum albumin) and bacteriophage MS2. Inactivation efficiency will be assessed by quantifying residual viable virus concentrations, using the plaque assay with Avicel overlay. Specific tasks include to (1) select a model coronavirus (e.g., HCoV-NL63) and attachment factors for molecular imprinting; (2) prepare homogenous, stable, biomolecular materials for imprinting; (3) synthesize the molecularly-imprinted catalyst; (4) characterize adsorption kinetics and selectivity of target coronavirus particles to the molecularly-imprinted catalyst; (5) benchmark virus inactivation efficiency of the molecularly imprinted -coated catalyst against traditional disinfection methods (chlorination, ultraviolet irradiation) under realistic conditions; and (6) assess durability and reuse potential of the molecularly imprinted catalyst  Project results will be integrated into various courses, including the NanoEnvironmental Engineering for Teachers (NEET) course at Rice, which enrolls 15 teachers that reach over 3,300 high school students annually.

If successful, this research can lead to a same day assessment of the potential risks associated with contaminated water to protect the health of the public. Additional benefits to society will result from educating high school students, the public, and water quality professionals through outreach and training, thus increasing the understanding of water quality and disease. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to establish rapid microbiological water quality and risk assessment tools for water management. The central hypothesis is that the concentration of a pathogen can be expressed as a function of fecal indicator (FI), microbial source tracking (MST) markers, and environmental parameters. Pathogen concentrations will be used to assess potential human health risks by quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The specific objectives of this research are to (1) simultaneously quantify major waterborne pathogens (bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens) as well as FI and MST markers in water samples, (2) create and validate models to predict pathogen concentrations from FI and MST marker data, and (3) establish a QMRA workflow targeting multiple pathogens. While there are numerous models to predict FI from environmental parameters, only limited attempts have been made to predict concentrations of pathogens due to the lack of comprehensive data sets. This research will take advantage of the high-throughput quantitative PCR technology to collect large data sets of pathogens, FI, and MST marker concentrations. As a result of this research, utilities, public health professionals, water quality managers, and other stakeholders will be able to rapidly assess water quality and prevent disease outbreaks without specialized skills and costly equipment. To increase broader impacts, this project proposes a comprehensive plan that will (1) involve undergraduate and high school students in environmental research, (2) conduct outreach activities at local farmer?s markets and at the Minnesota State Fair, and (3) organize a qPCR and QMRA workshop for managers of local wastewater treatment plants and recreational beaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As of April 2, 2020, there have been more than one million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 55,000 deaths. These numbers are increasing rapidly. Yet, the short time since the beginning of this outbreak limits our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 spreads. The objective of this project is to address this gap. In response to evidence that the rate of infections among healthcare providers is alarmingly high, this project will expose transmission patterns in the hospital setting. In collaboration with the Cleveland Clinic, the investigators will have access to genomic, epidemiological, and clinical patient data. Joint computational analysis of this data will result in a computational model that will provide insights into transmission patterns in hospitals, such as from patients to doctors and health workers, or from doctors to doctors. <br/><br/>The activities in this project will be organized along three Aims. Aim 1: Perform whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples collected at the Cleveland Clinic. The data will be augmented by existing SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from multiple online databases, as well as existing sequence data from other species. Aim 2: Build an analysis pipeline and perform evolutionary analysis of genomic data obtained in Aim 1. Aim 3: Perform joint analysis of genomic, epidemiological, and clinical data to infer transmission patterns. One of the unique advantages of the project is the ability to directly link identified genomic strains to clinical data. The activities have direct clinical implications for better protecting healthcare workers and minimizing the overall rate of infections in the hospital setting.

MASH-Pandemics will build on previously developed sophisticated, detailed discrete-event simulation-based hospital capacity and capability analysis models of typical U.S. urban hospitals. This RAPID project will support the re-specification of these models, data collection, model runs, and results analysis, outcomes from which will aid hospital administrators and regions in making optimal operational changes and collaboration plans enabled through state and national emergency declarations in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. An online portal will be constructed on which details of the modeling capabilities, practical findings and recommendations, along with potential policy implications, for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic will be posted. Additionally, run requests from hospitals, hospital collaborations and geographical regions will be taken through the portal. This work will generate crucial synthetic data needed to develop quick recommendations and analyses in a period where time is of the essence. Key outputs will include, for example: potential for various modified operational strategies to benefit hospital performance and patient survival, hospital collaboration strategies to aid regional response, anticipating critical supply needs to mobilize and prioritize support from supply chains (or Federal response capabilities), and recommendations for effective implementation of capacity enhancement strategies (alternative standards of care, modified operations, demand management). The project will provide input to educational activities in the future, once the project is complete and the pandemic subsides.

This award fills the gap by supporting an integrated experimental, theoretical, and computational study of this interaction in silicon. Silicon is chosen as a representative material because it exhibits numerous types of phase transformations and is widely used in electronics and micro-electromechanical systems, as well as solar cells. The knowledge gained on the fundamental aspects of phase transformation-plasticity interaction under high pressure will also have broader implications on the quantitative modeling and optimization of surface processes, such as polishing, turning, and scratching, for brittle semiconductors and ceramics. As part of the project, there will be opportunities to educate and train graduate and undergraduate students through special courses and research, parts of which will be conducted at the Argonne National Laboratory, with an emphasis on underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of plastic flow on phase transformation under high pressure in silicon. Coupled in situ high-throughput experiments and modeling will yield quantitative characterization and understanding of how plastic straining drastically reduces the transformation pressure, promotes the formation of novel phases, retains high-pressure phases at ambient pressure, and changes transformation paths between different phases. Silicon samples will be compressed and sheared in a rotational diamond anvil cell. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and absorption, Raman spectroscopy, and displacement measurements will be used for in-situ diagnostics of the deformation and transformation processes. A microscale phase field approach for coupled phase transformations and localized shear bands (e.g., due to dislocation pileups) will be developed and used to study the interplay between multiple phase transformations and mechanisms of plasticity in single grains and polycrystalline aggregates. Phase transformation criteria, strain-controlled kinetic equations, and the pressure- and plastic strain-dependent yield strengths of all phases and phase mixtures will be obtained from the experiments and incorporated in a macroscale phenomenological model.

Radical-containing compounds usually are unstable species, easily reacting with other molecules.  The goal of this research is the design, synthesis, and characterization of stable radical-containing molecules which have unconventional magnetic properties.  The new results and insights may provide fundamental understanding of structure and property relationships for organic molecules while advancing the development of new materials. Such materials may serve as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and relaxation enhancement agents for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The materials may also serve as organic spin filters for spintronics, and other applications.  The research activities comprise multi-step organic synthesis, diverse physical/materials characterization of organic molecules, and high level computations.  This research provides students with opportunities to gain a broad education as well as to develop a wide range of skills. <br/><br/>Specific objectives of this project are the synthesis and study of robust high-spin nitrogen-centered radicals.  These include: di- and tri-radicals based on tetrazolinyl radical derivatives and diradical dications and triradical trications of double helical pi-systems. The tetrazolinyl radicals possess properties for thin film fabrication by evaporation under ultra-high vacuum. The double helical nitrogen-centered high-spin diradical dications and triradical trications are predicted to be strongly paramagnetic but stable at room temperature.  These may provide future building blocks for high-spin polyradical cations. The strength of chiroptical properties of nitrogen-centered high-spin diradical dications of double helical pi-system is comparable to those of [n]helicenes. The combination of strong paramagnetism with double helical pi-systems may render unique properties due to the combination of chirality and delocalized electronic spin.  This provides an avenue for development of novel paramagnetic materials with strong chiral properties that could facilitate discovery of new organic magneto-optic materials and devices, including efficient organic spin filters for spintronics. The radicals are prepared by modern organic synthetic methodologies, including newly developed radical-radical cross-couplings, and characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, as well as computations.

Social distancing is an idea that, when enacted, can lower disease transmission risk and slow the spread of infection in a population.  In the case of the current COVID-19 outbreak, in the absence of ready vaccines and medical treatments, social distancing is our best line of defense. The prevalence of social distancing behaviors can depend, however, on the mix of social and geographic communities and their social norms, influencing spread dynamics in schools, social media, work environments, and among friends and family.  Members of some social communities (e.g. social media friend groups) may share values and beliefs together without necessarily being in close geographic proximity. Alternatively, people can come into physical proximity?at work, shops, beaches, sporting events? without sharing strongly-held beliefs. Sometimes, even strangers may copy certain visible behaviors, such as wearing protective masks at the grocery store.  A pandemic is both a biological and social phenomenon. This work will develop practical tools (models) that predict the interaction between collective behavior and the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease spread. This will enable more accurate predictions of medical resources the population will need over time. Public health measures can target not only individual behavior but also collective behavior, which may require different incentives and nudges, such that public health messaging can be maximally beneficial. Results from the project will also be shared through a public webinar on the role of mathematics in pandemic preparedness.<br/><br/>This work to address these gaps will involve two different types of mathematical modeling efforts. The first type will rely on designing a system ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to capture both disease dynamics and social influence. This ODE model will assume that mass action average rates of transition between both disease and belief states are sufficient to gain insight, producing quantitative characterizations to describe how belief dynamics interact with disease prevalence in a community as both progress over time. The second type will rely on designing coupled multi-layer networks in which one layer captures social influence and the other captures physical contact and disease transmission. This model will explore dynamic connections among individuals within each layer, where the strength of contact can shift based on the state and neighbors of the same individual in the other layer. This second model, by focusing on particular network structures will complement the insights about average behaviors gained by the ODE model and provide insight into the different roles individuals may play in shifting community perception and/or spreading infection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reliable extraction of this information, however, requires that we understand the relationships between the processes that transport sediment over the Earth?s surface and the landscapes that they create. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the role of debris flows in shaping steep landscapes. Debris flows are mixtures of mud, rocks, and other incidental debris (such as trees) that can travel at high speeds down valley networks. Their large size, rapid motion, and episodic behavior pose hazards to life and infrastructure. They also erode the valleys they travel through, contributing to the shape of steep landscapes. Debris flows are thought to be a dominant mechanism for transporting sediment and eroding bedrock in steep terrain, but we currently lack a mathematical framework to describe how landscapes respond to erosion by debris flows. In this project, the investigators will develop a model to predict how debris flows erode landscapes and apply this model to understand how changes in tectonics, climate, and land-use influence topography and the sediment volumes passed on to downstream rivers and reservoirs. The project will improve our ability to extract information about tectonics and climate from topographic data and will contribute to resolving a long-standing debate regarding the relative importance of debris flows and water-dominated flows in sculpting bedrock channel networks. This project will train one postdoctoral researcher, one PhD student, one MS student, and three undergraduate students. Two of the undergraduate students will be recruited through the University of Arizona ASEMS (Arizona?s Science Engineering and Math Scholars) program, which is designed to support underrepresented students in STEM fields. The investigators will also produce online community learning tools, lead in-person clinics that support students and researchers in using the model and analysis tools developed through the course of the project, and give guest lectures at a public high school.<br/><br/>Debris flows are thought to be a primary driver of erosion in many steeplands but we currently lack a generalizable, mechanistic approach for quantifying debris flow erosion within landscape evolution models. As such, our ability to predict the dynamics of steeplands, including their geomorphic responses to tectonic, climatic, and anthropogenic forcing, is limited. This project will address three fundamental questions related to the geomorphic role of debris flow erosion: 1) How can we quantify erosion by episodic debris flows over geologic timescales?, 2) How does debris flow erosion influence the morphology of quasi-steady state landscapes?, and 3) How does debris flow erosion influence transient signals (e.g. knickpoints) propagating through the channel network? To address these questions, the investigators propose to analyze debris flow dominated landscapes in the Oregon Coast Range (OCR) and the San Gabriel Mountains (SGM), conduct a field campaign designed to relate changes in landscape morphology to tectonic forcing and environmental factors, and develop a novel landscape evolution model that incorporates debris flow erosion. The debris flow erosion model will employ process-based equations for debris flow motion that honor the discrete nature, transient flow dynamics, and limited mobility of debris flows that differentiates them from water-dominated flows. From this detailed picture of nonlocal debris-flow dynamics, the investigators will then calculate debris flow erosion within bedrock channels integrated over geologic time. The model will be validated through comparisons with topographic analyses of channel network properties and millennial-scale erosion rates in debris-flow-dominated valleys in the OCR and SGM. They will apply their process-based modeling approach in combination with data and observations from our study sites to derive a geomorphic transport law for debris flow erosion, quantify the impact of debris flow erosion on the form of steady state landscapes, and explore how debris flows influence the propagation of transient signals through the channel network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current models divide a population of individuals into compartments, such as, susceptible, exposed but non-infectious, asymptomatic but infectious, symptomatic and infectious, recovered, and deceased. To simplify the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, the prevailing assumption is that individuals in the same compartment behave identically. One way to add sophistication to these so-called compartmental models is by categorizing individuals in a more fine-grained manner, thus adding more compartments. This results in more parameters added to a model. Estimating these parameters requires more data, and more data increases the computational cost of estimating the parameters. In addition, as this pandemic is showing, our access to data is varied. Within each country and municipality, different sampling strategies are being pursued. This project lowers the computational cost of setting up and updating complex, compartmental epidemiological models as more data becomes available. By doing so, the project improves the ability of the scientific community to make more accurate predictions on the spread of the virus and inform on the effectiveness of local policy decisions on mitigation strategies. <br/><br/>The investigators adopt a category of model fitting that has seen recent success in molecular dynamics simulations in molecular modeling ? maximum entropy biasing methods. These methods replace model parameter optimization with a minimal biasing term that is independent of the model parameters. This makes the runtime complexity of model optimization linear with the amount of data and independent of the unknown number of parameters. The activities will enable rapid optimization of complex models that additionally consider spatial resolution and sampling biasing. The improved cost of the optimization process will permit frequent updates of compartmental models without the need for full parameter optimization each time new data is observed. The investigators will collaborate closely with others in the rapidly coalescing COVID-19 research community by releasing code, data, and findings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Introduction of additional features, including health-related context and confidence measures for the data and information presented, will increase the dashboard's utility in supporting awareness and decision-making.  Additional model and analytic research and development will enhance detection and classification, and more broadly, relative risk determination of events of concern from all sourced health related data. Longer term, systems engineering activities associated with this development will ensure an enduring capability established, vetted, and well-used prior to the next potential pandemic.

Commercially available handheld devices that utilize Raman spectroscopy are superior to color test but are too expensive for local and state LE agencies to widely adopt. The research objectives involve further developing a system that leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in a low-cost handheld spectrometer, a sampling device that uses a drug-indicating chemosensor, and software that consists of a mobile app and cloud-based technology to help identify illegal substances and specific drug signatures. The anticipated technical results will be the optimization of the handheld spectrometer design and drug-sampling device, identification of new photoluminescent chemosensors for controlled substances, and software to enhance the accuracy of the sample data analysis.  This system will establish tools for forensic analysis of drug signatures and regional trends in illegal drug trafficking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two milkweed species, the common milkweed and the showy milkweed, form hybrids across a wide region of the central United States. The research will determine the extent of natural hybridization between these species and identify the cellular pathways that differ between species. This information will allow identification of cellular pathways that are disrupted when hybridization occurs. This work will shed light on both the organization of biochemical pathways and the mechanisms that keep species reproductively isolated. Understanding the effects of hybridization will become increasingly important as climate change and human disturbance cause species ranges to shift and bring previously isolated species into contact. The results of the project will be integrated into undergraduate courses to strengthen bioinformatics and introductory biology courses with a focus on quantitative reasoning, modeling, and simulations.<br/><br/>This research addresses a fundamental gap in our understanding of metabolic pathways and how the metabolome changes during speciation. When species evolve in isolation and come back into contact, the hybrids they form often display variation outside of the parental means (transgressive segregation). By studying natural and hand-pollinated hybrids along with the parental species, the researchers will uncover the changes to the genetic architecture that occur as species diverge. The researchers will use (1) genotype-by-sequencing to reconstruct the history of hybridization across the region of sympatry and (2) a comprehensive global metabolomics study to identify how pathways are disrupted following hybridization.

This shift has been accompanied by drastic limitations in students? daily activities, social interactions, and job opportunities.  Given that the current disruption in the system is transient in nature, it is urgent to collect and analyze the data needed to understand the impact of the pandemic on undergraduate students.  To this end, this project will examine the immediate and long-term impacts of the pandemic on undergraduate students? emotional well-being, day-to-day functioning, and learning.  The study aims to provide insights on how disruptions can affect learners? stress, engagement, and learning outcomes both during the online learning experience and during the return to learning conditions that are similar to those prior to the disruption.  Results from this project will help inform higher-education institutions and policymakers as they develop strategies to mitigate the effects on student learning resulting from the current pandemic and to plan responses for future disruptions.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the longitudinal and dynamic impact of the pandemic on undergraduate STEM students? emotional states (such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and frustration), day-to-day life (such as social isolation, sedentariness, access to outdoor environments, and proximity to outbreak hotspots), and learning engagement and outcomes.  Fluctuations in students? day-to-day functions and emotional states will be evaluated during and after the pandemic, using information from psychological surveys, interviews, computer vision-based analytics, and wearable sensors.  Learning outcomes will be assessed using grades and self-evaluation of learning.  Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the resulting data will be used to understand the effects of the disruptions in daily life on students? emotional states and learning outcomes.

An abundance of research has documented the negative effects of stress and instability within families and on child development in particular. There is relative lack of data, however, on factors that may protect children against the effects of such an unprecedented set of stressors.

This creates unique stressors for parents who are struggling to oversee their children?s education while doing their normal jobs from home or working as an essential worker.  Most of these parents have no previous experience with this form of homeschooling and many are working with their children to complete online schooling content.  Also, many parents have limited experience working from home.  This project will interview parents about their experiences with work and this form of homeschooling in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Key research questions include:  Who is overseeing children?s at-home work?  Are there gendered patterns to overseeing children?s schoolwork and how do they present themselves?  Do parents and children have adequate technology at home to both work and do schoolwork at home in the context of online educational plans? How do parents balance their work and school arrangements? How do parents organize their day around children?s schoolwork and work?  What stressors do parents face in this new arrangement?  Do parents have adequate support from schools and teachers to provide for implementing their children?s at-home learning?

A key scientific goal concerning COVID-19 is to develop mathematical models that help in understanding and predicting its spreading behavior, as well as supporting guidelines on what can be done to limit its spread. In this project, the PIs aim to achieve these goals by applying their recent findings on a new epidemic model to the spread of COVID-19. The PIs will work on a model that considers the possibility of COVID-19 mutating into different strains with different spreading characteristics. By also considering changes in the spreading behavior of COVID-19 due to environmental factors and changes in human behavior (seasonal changes, travel bans, etc.), they aim to obtain results that will help assess the effectiveness of countermeasures that can be taken against the spread of the virus and to help better prepare for different mutation scenarios, including worst-cases. <br/>Most existing models of epidemics assume that an infectious individual passes the same pathogen strain that she was infected with to a susceptible individual in her contact network. This assumption may not hold in real-life as pathogens often evolve over time, and the ways a pathogen evolves might lead to significant changes in its spreading dynamics. This project aims to improve the state-of-the-art mathematical and computational models for predicting the spread of COVID-19 to incorporate the effects of evolution and mutations. This will be done by leveraging recent work of the PIs in which they developed a mathematical model to predict the spreading dynamics for multiple-strain epidemics models with mutations. By incorporating the potential changes in the reproduction number R0 (due to countermeasures or mutations), the PIs aim to obtain a better understanding of the future progress of the COVID-19 spread; obtain different predictions of the spread of COVID-19 under different scenarios including extensive bans on travel, school/shop closures, as well as potential evolution into different strains; and add to the public discourse on the expected effectiveness of various countermeasures that can be taken to slow down the spread of COVID-19.

The underlying measurement principle is based on the interference of light reflected from an optically transparent thin film?the same phenomenon that gives rainbow colors to a soap film when illuminated by white light. The proposed innovation uses a different approach than the conventional method of enhancing the signal through complex optical resonances; instead, we exploit the power of signal averaging to achieve very high sensitivity in a simple instrument platform. By design, the IRIS technique is resilient to the background signal due to variations in the solution (termed ?bulk effect?). The proposed new technique will further improve the ability to distinguish molecular binding on the surface from the variations in the bulk solution. The proposed IRIS platform is unique among all label-free optical biosensors with multiplexed detection of molecular binding kinetics on Si microfludic chips as low-cost consumables. Hundreds of capture probes can be arrayed on the IRIS chip and tested against a target molecule in parallel.

This project investigates how chemical reactions in marine sediments exposed to high riverine sediment loads influence ocean acidification in coastal waters. Although we know that ocean acidification affects marine life and commercial fisheries in coastal waters, little is known about how acidification processes in the water column are influenced by reactions occurring in sediments on the sea floor. The role of large sediment deposits from rivers in these processes has also never been investigated. This study will be conducted in the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River transports a high sediment load to the continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and plays an important role in the economy of the southern coast of the United States. Results from this study will be useful to the oceanographic community for increasing understanding of ocean acidification processes in delta and shelf environments. It will also benefit decision makers interested in predicting the role of sediments on the nutrient -rich Louisiana shelf for discharge control purposes. This project also has an important educational component by training undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, providing experiences at sea for undergraduates, and conducting outreach activities with K-12 students.<br/><br/>The geochemical and microbiological processes responsible for the transformation of particles deposited on the seafloor will be characterized near the Mississippi River mouth and along the nearby continental slope. The release of acids (CO2) and bases (alkalinity) from the sediment will be quantified using autonomous instruments deployed on the seafloor to determine whether sediments contribute to the acidity of the surrounding water column or instead provide bases to buffer the water column from atmospheric CO2 inputs. As the Mississippi River discharge during the later Winter and Spring provides much more sediment to the coastal zone compared to the rest of the year, research cruises will be taken twice a year to determine how seasonal variations in riverine discharge affect the release of acids and bases into the water column. Mathematical models will then be used to predict the effect of seasonal variations on acids or bases release to the water column. This study will therefore provide a quantitative understanding of the role of large sediment depositions to the seafloor on sediment geochemical and microbiological processes and their feedback to the overlying waters. Simultaneously, a large data set will be generated and used to calibrate mathematical models and better characterize benthic-pelagic interactions.

Coincident with this extinction, the Antarctic portion of the supercontinent of Pangea transitioned to a warmer climatic regime devoid of a permanent ice cap.  Compared to lower latitudes, relatively little is known about the survivors of the extinction in Antarctica, although it has been hypothesized that the continents more polar location shielded it from the worst of the extinctions effects.  As the result of a NSF-sponsored deep field camp in 2017/2018, a remarkable collection of vertebrate fossils was discovered in the rocks of the Shackleton Glacier region.  This collection includes the best preserved and most complete materials of fossil amphibians ever recovered from Antarctica, including two previously undescribed species.  This grant supports one postdoctoral researcher with expertise in fossil amphibians to describe and interpret the significance of these fossils, including their identification, relationships, and how they fit into the terrestrial ecosystem of Antarctica and other southern hemisphere terrestrial assemblages in light of the major reorganization of post-extinction environments.  Historical collections of fossil amphibians will also be reviewed as part of this work.  Undergraduate students at the University of Washington will be actively involved as part of this research and learn skills like hard tissue histology and CT data manipulation.  Public engagement in Antarctic science will be accomplished at the University of Washington Burke Museum, which is the Washington State museum of natural history and culture.  Specifically, a new exhibit on Antarctic amphibians will be developed as part of the paleontology gallery, which sees over 100,000 visitors per year.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This two-year project will examine the evolution of Triassic temnospondyls based on a remarkable collection of fossils recently recovered from the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica.  Temnospondyls collected from the middle member of the Fremouw Formation are part of the first collection of identifiable tetrapod fossils from this stratigraphic interval. Thorough anatomical description and comparisons of these fossils will add new faunal information and also aid in determining if this horizon is Early or Middle Triassic in age.  Exquisitely preserved temnospondyl material from the lower Fremouw Formation will permit more precise identification than previously possible and will provide insights into the earliest stages of their radiation in the extinction recovery interval.  Overall, the Principal Investigator and Postdoctoral Researcher will spearhead an effort to revise the systematics of the Antarctic members of Temnospondyli and properly contextualize them in the framework of Triassic tetrapod evolution.  The research team will also take advantage of the climate-sensitive nature of fossil amphibians to better understand patterns of seasonality at high-latitudes during the early Mesozoic by subjecting selected fossils to histological analysis.  Preliminary data suggest that temnospondyls were exceptionally diverse and highly endemic immediately after the end-Permian extinction, when compared to their distribution before and after this interval.  If confirmed, this macroevolutionary pattern could be used to predict the response of modern amphibians to future climate perturbations.  Overall, this research will provide new insights into the vertebrate fauna of the Fremouw Formation, as well as shed light on the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems in southern Pangea in the wake of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.  As part of the broader impacts, the research team will help to develop an exhibit featuring some of the best preserved fossils from Antarctica to explain to the public how paleontologists use fossils and rocks to understand past climates like the Triassic 'hot-house' world that lacked permanent ice caps at the poles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examining the trend of COVID-19 data suggests other routes of transmission beyond direct person-to-person transmission are likely. Recent reports show that aerosols containing SARS-CoV2 could  still infect an individual for up to 3 hours later, and plastic surfaces contaminated with SARS-CoV2 can remain infective for up to 3 days. Trace evidence of the virus was recovered from Diamond Princess cruise ship cabins up to 17 days after the passengers left. The goal of this project is to understand COVID-19 transmission through virus-contaminated respiratory droplets, fine solid or liquid particles in air, and contact with virus-contaminated surfaces. This study will model human behaviors effecting disease transmission, the properties of the virus, and environmental factors that may affect disease transmission to predict infection risk. If successful, this project will help describe transmission patterns of SARS-CoV2 and provide new ways to slow or halt the spread of this disease in the US. <br/> <br/>The goal of this project is to identify the infection risk of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 through different exposure routes in order to prioritize measures for public health protection. The specific objectives of this work are to: 1) model the spread of SARS-CoV2 through droplets and aerosols from coughing/sneezing and through aerosols generated from toilet flushing under different environmental conditions; 2) develop exposure models through inhalation of droplets and aerosols to determine the dose of single and repeated exposure; and 3) model repeated exposure through contact with contaminated surfaces and hands-to-face transmission. The models will incorporate mechanistic understanding of aerosol generation, transport, and fate under different conditions, as well as data fitting to predict aerosol size and concentration under different test scenarios. SARS-CoV2 viral shedding rate from patients and its persistence in different environmental media will be used to model the viral load through aerosol and contact exposure. Human physiology and habits will be coupled with viral attack rates to quantify the risk using a Monte Carlo probability simulator. The sensitivity analysis will also identify data gaps for rapid data collection in collaboration with teams of researchers from different disciplines. The results of this project will contribute to the understanding of global spread of infectious disease beyond short and long-term remediation strategies on COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The goal of this award is to advance understanding of how children?s science podcasts can provide families with information to help ease children?s anxiety and fears during a pandemic. The project?s hypothesis is that through listening to Brains On! coronavirus-related episodes, children will increase their understanding of science concepts related to the pandemic. As they gain this understanding, it is predicted that their overall fear and anxiety about the pandemic will diminish, they will feel empowered to ask pandemic-related questions and will engage in more science- based conversations with their family members.  The project will develop three Brains On! podcast episodes focused specifically on the COVID-19 pandemic for kids aged 5 to 12 and their families. The research questions include:<br/><br/>1.	How and to what extent do Brains On!?s coronavirus-based episodes help children and their families understand and talk about science-related pandemic topics? <br/>What kind of conversations are sparked by these episodes?<br/>2.	What kinds of questions do children have after listening to the Brains On! coronavirus episodes and what are the reasons for their questions? What can the questions tell us about the impact of listening on kids' science engagement and learning?<br/>3.	What resources do parents need to answer children?s questions and help them understand science topics related to the pandemic?<br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between a media producer, Minnesota Public Radio and researchers at The Science Museum of Minnesota.  Brains On! already has a large listening audience, with 7 million downloads a year, and more than 200,000 unique listeners a month and these new episodes are likely to increase listenership further.  The research findings will be quickly disseminated to a wide range of audiences that can immediately apply the findings to create media and other coronavirus-related educational resources for families.  <br/><br/>The PI's prior NSF funded projects have found that previous Brains On! podcasts with a range of STEM content increase the number and sophistication of the science questions children ask and lead to science-based conversations with family members. This project will study the impacts in relation to a singular topic, COVID-19.  Three online surveys of Brains On! listeners (families with children ages 5 - 12 years old) will be conducted. The first survey to be conducted as soon as the project begins will focus on parents reflecting on what information is needed at that stage of the pandemic. Two additional listener surveys will occur immediately after new COVID-19 podcast episodes are released. These surveys will ask content-specific questions to understand how well the episode conveys that information to children and their families, what conversations were sparked from the content, and what additional information needs families have. Prior to administering each of the three surveys, video-based think-aloud interviews with 10 families will test and revise survey questions.<br/><br/>Survey participants will be recruited using language in Brains On! episodes, social media, website, and newsletters. A sample size of around 1,000 for each of the surveys is planned (based on a 95% confidence interval and ±3% sampling error).   Analyses will include descriptive statistics and thematic coding of open-ended survey questions.  Subgroup samples, when large enough will look at differences in responses by demographic variables (e.g. race/ethnicity, household income, highest level of education in the household, an adult in the household with a STEM career, gender of child, geographic location). The researchers and Brains On! staff will work together to identify how the findings can be applied to the development of subsequent coronavirus-related episodes and shared with the ISE field to further support families? education and information needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Technology Translation (PFI-TT) project comes from the development of additives that provide an immediate boost in battery capacity without introducing any changes to their manufacturing scheme. The lack of affordable higher-capacity batteries is recognized as a barrier to the broad utilization of, for instance, electric vehicles and renewable energy sources. Improved batteries are needed to support a transition to a greener and more sustainable society. The development of additives that can be easily integrated in current battery designs will facilitate their implementation and future commercialization, giving them a crucial advantage at a time when the battery market is both rapidly expanding and becoming increasingly competitive. This NSF PFI-TT grant will support technological validation and the development of prototypes for field-testing, both necessary step towards successful commercialization. The PI will leverage both the existing close collaboration with the Entrepreneurial Proof of Concept and Innovation Center (EPIC) and the presence of a large population of students from under-represented minorities at UCR Riverside, an accredited Hispanic Serving Institution, to provide unique training opportunities not only in science and engineering but also in entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>The proposed project will target additives based on silicon, which, while having much higher lithiation capacity than broadly utilized graphite, has yet to be adopted by battery manufacturers on a large scale. This is due to both technical (silicon alone has poor stability over many charge-discharge cycles) and economic (silicon can be made stable but this requires complex designs) issues. This project will overcome these limitations. A simple, single-stage carbon coating step enables the integration of silicon powders into graphite-dominant anodes. Careful control of the process parameters allows realizing a high-quality carbon coating, which is crucial for the successful utilization of the additives. By developing a ?drop-in? additive, this technology enables an increase in battery capacity without requiring any capital intensive investment for the battery manufacturers. As part of this project, this core technology will be advanced and the results in terms of capacity improvement and cycle stability will be validated by independent testing facilities. By the completion of this project, battery prototypes that incorporate silicon-based additives will be field-tested under real-life conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include harmful algal blooms, acid rain and smog. In cities, fossil fuel burning and fertilizer application add large amounts of nitrogen to stormwater. City infrastructure carries stormwater downstream, which may pollute downstream ecosystems with excess nitrogen. Nature-based designs that use ecological processes to remove nitrogen from stormwater may provide a solution. These green infrastructure designs are popular in cities globally. Questions remain, however, about their effectiveness. Should green infrastructure design mimic natural ecosystems as closely as possible? Or can new combinations of soils and species more effectively mitigate pollution? This research will seek answers to these questions by studying several types of stormwater management facilities in Salt Lake City, UT. Results from this research will provide useful guidance to the design of stormwater management systems. It also has the potential to advance fundamental understanding of the nitrogen cycle. Researchers will also conduct extensive public outreach and educational activities to highlight the importance of ecological processes in urban spaces.<br/><br/>The scientific community currently lacks a theoretical framework to guide design of ecosystems that maximize nitrogen retention.  This is due largely to the complexity of nitrogen cycling in ecosystems. The researchers propose to quantify the relative influence of two key paradigms of ecosystem science on nitrogen retention: biodiversity-ecosystem function and thermodynamic ecological stoichiometry. The project will involve quantifying rates of nitrogen retention processes (microbial & plant uptake, plant biomass and soil nitrogen accumulation, and permanent gaseous removal) over event-scale and seasonal-scale in two sets of replicated stormwater management experimental facilities, as well as replicate plots in an adjacent natural area. The first experimental facility includes nine plots planted with three levels of plant functional diversity. The second includes eight plots with two levels of plant community composition: ornamental vs. native, xeric-adapted species.  Researchers hypothesize that plots with high plant diversity and/or xeric-adapted traits will have higher nitrogen retention if physiological traits related to rapid resource acquisition are an important driver of nitrogen cycling. Further, researchers hypothesize that variation in microbial community diversity across plots and over time following plot establishment will correlate with higher nitrogen immobilization and denitrification if biodiversity is an important driver of these processes. Conversely, if biodiversity is not an important driver of ecosystem scale nitrogen fluxes, we expect to find retention rates follow thermodynamic and stoichiometric models without significant variation across plant communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, this complexity incurs substantial computational expense, and creates a challenge for researchers to perform targeted experiments and investigate specific dynamical processes. Idealizing the climate system through the creation of simplified models is a way of performing these types of highly focused studies while avoiding complexity and expense. However, the climate modeling community presently lacks the software infrastructure to easily configure these models using minimal physics packages, simplified domain geometries, or more streamlined model versions, within a single framework that bridges the gap between these simplified models and the fully coupled system. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a software toolchain to enable fast and seamless setup of coupled simplified models within NCAR?s Community Earth System Model (CESM). This Simpler Models toolchain will be officially supported as part of the CESM modeling framework, and will serve the needs of the research and academic communities across all climate science disciplines.<br/><br/>The overarching goal for the Simpler Models toolchain is to streamline the user workflow and enable research-ready coupled modeling at minimal expense in terms of human or computing time. The first component of the toolchain, the Simpler Models Query Tool, will advise users on the compatibility and configuration of different earth system model components based on their XML metadata. This tool will essentially let the user hone their modeling strategy without having to consult each component?s documentation or resorting to a trial and error approach. The toolchain will then allow for the configuration of model resolution and idealized domain geometries in such a way as to ensure compatibility across components. The workflow enabled by the toolchain will be structured so that compatibility of the coupled system is guaranteed first, followed by customizations at progressively higher levels of granularity within individual model components. The toolchain will be accompanied by user documentation that will be hosted on the CESM Simpler Models website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A consequence of the program has been the emergence of a nationwide NSF ADVANCE network of more than 195 universities and STEM organizations, with more than 1,500 individuals. This network includes Principal Investigators (PIs) and co-PIs, project directors and managers, advisory board members, evaluators, STEM faculty at all ranks, and gender and diversity scholars. Many of these participants are, or become, mid- and top-level administrators who potentially spread ideas about how to construct equitable academic workplaces when they move to other institutions, when they serve in various roles on multiple grants, and when they produce scholarship and other publications, therefore extending the reach of the network?s equity-enhancement strategies.  The ECR project will examine how the network has multiplied the NSF?s initial investment through the exchange of ideas among STEM organizations.<br/><br/>The research project will use a multi-method social network approach to analyze the creation and diffusion of key ideas through the multilayered networks formed through NSF ADVANCE.

There is currently a severe shortage of respiratory masks leading to unprecedented changes in healthcare protocols, to not only not change masks between patients but reuse masks over several hours or days, against common medical practice and creating serious risks of cross-contamination of patients and infection of personnel. Fast and effective sanitizing methods are needed to allow for the safe reuse of masks to protect patients and health care workers alike. The novel protocols need to assure rapid destruction of the virus while not compromising the protection efficacy. This project aims at designing a novel germicidal ultraviolet light irradiation system using light emitting diodes coated with nanoparticles to maximize the irradiation efficiency. Nanoparticles enhanced irradiation sources will be optimized to assure a more equal distribution of the germicidal light dose across curved surfaces (such as molded masks), increasing the process speed, while decreasing the potential damage by excess radiation. Potential radiation damage to mask material will be investigated while mask performance will be carefully monitored. The project will yield a novel nanotechnology enhanced ultraviolet disinfection system, while also providing critically needed scientific data on ultraviolet damage potential of masks in general and impacts of irradiation on protection efficacy. The project will make immediate broader impacts as it partners with health care practitioners. The funding will support the training of minority, undergraduate and graduate students in applied nanotechnology.<br/><br/>The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to a severe shortage in respiratory protective equipment for health care providers. The quest for processes to rapidly sanitize facial masks for safe reuse revealed some scientific knowledge gaps and technological challenges, even for common processes such as Ultraviolet Light irradiation. Technologically, delivering uniform light dosages to curved surfaces such as masks, to minimize total radiation dose and potential material damage while saving time and energy remains a challenge. This project will use nano-enabled, durable ultraviolet -light emitting diodes connected to optical fibers to optimize delivery of ultraviolet doses to non-flat surfaces. Scientifically, little information exists on ultraviolet damage to facial masks and the impact on the capture efficiency of the masks. This project will characterize chemically the nature of the ultraviolet radiation to the mask materials while also investigating potential changes to particle collection efficiency of the material. The capture efficiency and hence protection efficacy is a nanoparticle issue (virions are ~125 nm), beyond simple physical size as particles will also be trapped by electrostatic interactions, particularly important at nanoscale. The latter is really poorly understood in the context of facial masks and impact of humidity, particle size and potential radiation induced material surface changes. This project will contribute to ultraviolet radiation technology development, nanoscale insights on nanoparticle trapping and particle filter interactions. The project will support minority, undergraduate and student graduate training and have immediate impacts by direct collaboration with health care practitioners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an effort to prevent its spread, most people are working from home, which means that they are generating a larger amount of residential waste than normal. Further, the capacity of MSWMSs is being constrained by the increasing number of unavailable workers due to self-quarantining and the isolation of local areas as a result of travel bans. With a pandemic, the function and interplay of different system components (i.e., waste collection companies, waste transfer stations, local government agencies, material recovery facilities, and landfills) must become more adaptive to maximize the limited capacity, which is key to accommodating excessive waste demand. In this RAPID project, the project team will collect ephemeral data on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on MSWMSs in multiple U.S. states including Florida, New York, and California. Since the impact of the coronavirus on MSWMSs and their responses vary across states and from urban to rural setting, these data can be used to (i) identify and characterize a broad range of regional waste management challenges, (ii) track the emerging adaptive behaviors different system entities take to adequately operate municipal waste services, and (iii) specify the system requirements and characteristics (i.e., system composition, topology, and control) that enable successful adaptation during a pandemic. This project will yield a database of pandemic impacts and responses and associated attributes and variables in MSWMSs that will guide researchers, private sectors, regulators, and planning agencies toward the creation and implementation of resilient waste management operations for pandemics. <br/><br/>The primary project tasks are threefold. First, the team will identify and map entities, operations, relationships, and controls in each system through virtual meetings with waste management companies and solid waste management authorities, and review of waste management guidelines. This step will establish a baseline structure for the normal operation, which will help to distinguish entities' emerging behaviors during the pandemic. Second, an online survey will ask system entities about their waste-related challenges and responses; the survey will occur once per month over a six-month period. If normal operations require adaptation of system structure, an interview will be held to gain more insight into the collective decision-making context. Third, a virtual workshop with a technical advisory group will be organized at the end of this project to review MSWMSs' reported adaptive measures and discuss recommendations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Known as interfacial instabilities, fluid-fluid interfaces can deform and generate intricate and regularized patterns, such as tears of wine, fingers of paint as it coats a wall, and droplets forming from a liquid jet. In particular, when one of the fluid phases comprises particles, such as mud (a water and sand mixture), the dynamics of fluid-fluid interfaces can be even more complex and difficult to predict. In addition to their ubiquity, controlling interfacial instabilities is of critical importance in many engineering applications, ranging from droplet microfluidics, nanoparticle coating and printing, to manufacturing new functional materials. While many of these diverse applications involve a liquid phase comprising particles (also known as suspensions), the effects that suspended particles have on the interfacial instabilities are yet unknown. Hence, understanding the coupled dynamics between fluid-immersed particles and fluid-fluid interfaces can impact a wide range of applications and even lead to innovations that harness the instabilities for new applications. In addition, interfacial instabilities constitute a class of visually stunning phenomena that can be easily demonstrated in tabletop experiments or as part of an art project. Hence, the visual aspects of the research are incorporated into an educational module and outreach activities that connect art to core fluid mechanics concepts for students of diverse backgrounds and ages. These educational activities are designed to engage artistic students in science, to increase the diversity and retention of student in STEM, and to enhance awareness and appreciation for fundamental science and fluid mechanics in general public. <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the physical mechanisms and conditions for instabilities on the interface between the particle-liquid mixture and gas. Despite the ubiquity of processes that involve suspensions and fluid-fluid interfaces, the effects of fluid-immersed particles on the interfacial instabilities remain poorly understood, with opportunities for making fundamental advances. In this proposal, the PI experimentally considers two complementary flow configurations that interface gas with the mixture of non-colloidal particles and viscous liquid: 1) the suspension displacing air, and 2) air displacing the suspension inside a vertical Hele-Shaw cell. Distinct from the current state of the art, the two flow configurations are inherently stable without particles, so that they can isolate the effects of suspended particles on the fluid-fluid interface. The PI?s preliminary experiments have demonstrated the emergence of interfacial deformations and new particle-laden structures, which are induced by the coupling of particles with the fluid-fluid interface. Experimental measurements of the novel particle-induced instabilities are combined with reduced mathematical modeling and additional parametric studies, with the aim of discovering the basic mechanisms required to exploit the instability and lead to new pattern generation. The results of this fundamental study have the potential to transform the current understanding of the interfacial dynamics of suspensions and enable the use of suspended particles to control interfacial instabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Molecular simulations of viral processes in COVID-19 are useful to identify possible weaknesses in the viral life cycle.  This research focuses on the dynamics of coronavirus processes, including the conformational transitions that are required for the virus to function. The project has three main foci:  1) all-atom simulations of individual viral proteins that are essential to the viral life cycle; 2) a coarse-grain models to a holistic understanding of entire virion (the virus outside the host cell) and its large scale processes, such as fusion of virions with host cells; and 3) machine-learning-based approaches to link the all-atom and coarse grain models and further refine their accuracy.  As part of a larger, international community working on COVID-19, all data, models and analysis code will be made publicly available as soon as they are developed, including through the NSF-funded Molecular Science Software Institute (MolSSI).   The complete multiscale picture of virus structure and dynamics will be used to identify potential target sites for drug development and other therapeutic strategies.<br/><br/><br/>The research in this RAPID project is for the development and application of multiscale computer simulation methods to characterize key elements of large-scale viral processes in SARS-CoV-2 replication.

These buildings are designed and operated in normal conditions by default.

The binding of the viral spike protein to a receptor protein (called the angiotensin converting enzyme 2, or ACE2) is the first step in the infection of the human host cell. Blocking or inhibiting this interaction could stop the invasion of the human cell by this highly infectious virus. With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Dr. Xiaohong Tan at Bowling Green University in Bowling Green, Ohio to create DNA aptamers to inhibit this initial step of viral invasion. Aptamers are short sequences of DNA that fold into a shape that matches that of a target molecule, thereby keeping other molecules from binding. These DNA aptamers are ?designed? by successive selection of molecules from large mixtures of different sequences, resulting in a few sequences that keep all other DNAs from binding the target. Dr. Tan uses this selection process to find DNA aptamers that bind tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Two of more of the identified DNA aptamers are linked together to create ?super binders? that are much better at inhibiting the interaction than would any single aptamer. Constructing DNA aptamers that block the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells may lead to the design of antiviral agents that help lessen the infectivity that causes the COVID-19 pandemic.  Educational and training activities will focus on postdoctoral researchers learning cutting edge techniques in chemical biology on a ?front line? research problem. The team is developing ways to communicate their science to the public, to K-12 institutions, and to other research groups using distance learning technologies.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop polymeric molecules (fusion DNA aptamers) that significantly interact with the binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The objective is to effectively block the virus from binding to the specific ACE2 receptor, thereby blocking the entry of the virus into human cells and, as a result, its ability to cause COVID-19 infections.  Professor Tan uses SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to identify individual aptamers that interact with three distinct regions on the cell binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The affinities of aptamers to their targets are measured through standard binding assays. These individual high affinity DNA aptamers are connected together using nucleic acid or chemical linkers to make fusion aptamers that have affinities comparable to those of antibodies. The ability of these fused DNA aptamer ?super binders? to effectively block this interaction is tested against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using standard technologies, as well as live SARS-CoV-2 through collaboration with the University of Toledo Medical School.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Debate largely originates from contrasting emphases on different regions (forearc vs. retroarc) and different components (basins vs. magmatic arc vs. fold-thrust belt) of Cordilleran systems.  This project will incorporate analytical techniques, such as sedimentary basin analysis, isotope geochemistry, petrology, and U-Pb geochronology, to identify potentially coupled episodic phases of basin evolution and arc magmatism that may be linked to internally driven orogenic processes (including underthrusting, high-flux magmatism, and buildup then foundering of crustal/lithospheric roots), or externally driven tectonic processes including fluctuating slab dynamics (cycles of subduction shallowing vs. steepening and associated rapid vs. diminished shortening and subsidence) and oceanic terrane accretion.  Ecuador contains an important yet underappreciated record of tectonic quiescence or possible extension during what has been long regarded as uninterrupted Cenozoic shortening, thickening, and uplift along the entire Andean margin.  Such a fluctuating pattern of mountain building may govern the structural and stratigraphic evolution of many ocean-continent convergent margins, with implications for the tectonic regimes of subduction and collisional systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is significant recent evidence that the fluid dynamics behind these flows may play a significant role in the spread of Covid-19. The rapid spread of Covid-19 highlights the lack of effective guidelines and mitigation strategies for reducing the impact of a contagious virus in the absence of a vaccine. Recent evidence from hospitals, and even the press, suggests that the fluid dynamics of this transport pathway should be re-investigated. The focus of this research will be to quantify the complex flows associated with speech and breathing during a conversation or nearby encounter and show how transmission of particles between individuals occurs. The understanding gained from this work will provide actionable mitigation strategies to reduce transmission from asymptomatic people. These outcomes can be useful in the short term by offering routes to reducing potential viral transport and future infections.<br/><br/>This research will show how the inherent structural flow difference between exhalation and inhalation during speech or simple breathing could be a potent yet unsuspected transport mechanism for pathogen transmission. The results will quantify an important aspect of this transmission, which in the case of Covid-19 is associated with asymptomatic carriers during relatively close social interactions. The quantitative characterization of this important topic surrounding viral transmission has largely been absent from the fluid mechanics and transport phenomena literatures, and even absent more generally from quantitative studies of public health. Using flow visualization and numerical simulations, the investigation will decipher the fluid dynamics in the neighborhood of the head of an individual during breathing and speaking, and the corresponding environmental mixing important to potential transmission (inhalation of particles by a nearby person). This approach will allow quantifying the fraction of particles exhaled by one person that are inhaled by a nearby person as a function of their separation distance. In these ways, the research will shed new light on a simple yet fundamental mechanism of transport associated with simple human activities, i.e., breathing and speaking, which can be generalized to many pathogens and aid in the identification of potential mitigation strategies for disease transmission by aerosols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These assemblies behave like liquid droplets and provide a dynamic environment for biomolecular reactions requiring specific protein concentrations.  Some of these proteins are also known to aggregate and cause neurodegenerative diseases.  This raises the key question how the functional liquid droplets transform into the pathological solid aggregates.   In this research, advanced computational methods will be used to view how the structures of these proteins differ in the liquid droplets and aggregates.  The knowledge learned from this project will be essential in designing novel strategies that can disrupt pathological aggregates but do not disrupt functional droplets.  The concepts of computational modeling will be introduced into both the undergraduate research and high school biophysics apprenticeship programs at Arizona State University (ASU), a university with a significant underrepresented student population in a location that is home to a large number of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.  The PI will pay specific attention to promoting a variety of dissemination approaches through the ASU expert database to introduce the concepts of biophysics and to facilitate the dissemination of materials to a broad audience.<br/><br/>Intrinsically disordered proteins, proteins that lack a well-defined folded structure, have been shown to participate in both liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and aggregation.  The former is reversible, providing important intracellular functions, whereas the latter is often irreversible and disease-related.  There has been increasing interest in showing how droplet formation could induce aggregation, but little is known regarding the structure properties capable of distinguishing these two assembly states.  One major challenge is the lack of high-resolution modeling methods for integrating observations from multiple experimental techniques.  In this work, the PIs will develop a novel computational modeling framework to integrate multiple technologies.  Specifically, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations will be used to investigate the structure properties of disordered proteins in both dispersed and condensed phases and how these properties are influenced by their interaction partners.  Coarse-grained models will further be used to investigate both the formation of liquid droplets and aggregates.  The impact of droplet formation on its aggregation preference will be quantitatively assessed.  The project will leverage computational tools to establish fundamental physics principles that govern the structural (dis)similarities between LLPS and aggregation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary goal of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project is to collect time-sensitive online social media and crowd-sourced data and analyze patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The major focus will be towards understanding how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating risk and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread. The notion of influence will be captured by quantifying the network effects on such communication behavior and characterizing how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease. Given that communities responded to COVID-19 with limited or no preparation and there is uncertainty in the length of recovery for the communities already affected while new communities being threatened, the data collection effort requires rapid response for better coverage and careful monitoring. The data will include large-scale ephemeral online interactions of people in the affected communities and public officials who are involved in COVID-19 response, recovery, and mitigation efforts, followed by a data-driven network analytics and infographics of COVID-19 risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted. The proposed research will not only expand the knowledge base of spatio-temporal dynamics of risk perception and dissemination strategies in the emergence and aftermath of a major disease outbreak, but will also result in data-driven inference techniques to improve our understanding of how people express diverse concerns and how to harness and embed such information for designing intervention measures. The methodologies and findings of this rapid response research will benefit emergency management and public health agencies to define targeted information dissemination policies for public with diverse needs based on how people reacted to COVID-19 and their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards.<br/><br/>Public engagement in risk communication can lead to more effective decision-making and enhanced public feedback to the regulatory process. The primary goal of this RAPID project is to mine and analyze large-scale time-sensitive perishable crowd-sourced and social media data (rich spatio-temporal data) and reveal patterns of health-risk communication and community response in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus using data-driven methods and network science theories. The specific aims are threefold: (1) to document how public interact and communicate health risk information through their online social networks during a major disease outbreak; (2) to authenticate data from multiple sources and detect anomalies to avoid information overload and spread of misinformation; and (3) to examine how online social networks influence protective actions (e.g., social distancing, self-quarantine decisions) i.e. information cascades in health risk communication. To achieve the goal and aims, the project will utilize ephemeral time and geo-tagged social media interactions of users, agencies, news sources supplemented with crowd-sourced information on COVID-19. This study will have five theoretical and methodological contributions to the literature. It will: (1) advance our understanding of how individuals are socially influenced online, while communicating health risks and interacting in their respective communities as the disease continues to spread; (2) inform the literature on how information is exchanged among people who are socially connected online and exposed to health risk in such outbreaks of disease; (3) use novel machine-learning and network science models to quantify influence and network effects on such communication behavior; (4) capture the variability in network composition, risk communication strategies and risk averting behaviors adopted based on spatio-temporal correlations of risk and disease contagion; (5) ensure authenticity of the collected data from multiple sources and develop more accurate fully-distributed computational algorithms tailored to health risk anomaly detection in socio-technical systems. The findings from this research will be useful to public health and emergency management agencies for tailoring effective information dissemination policies for diverse user groups based on their social network characteristics, activities, and interactions in response to similar public health hazards. The methodologies, and implications of this research can be transferred in designing effective intervention policies to other natural and man-made disaster contexts in which public health risks become major concerns. The project will engage, mentor, and offer an innovative active learning environment for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students by giving priority to disadvantaged and underrepresented communities in USA.

However, black-box ML models, which rely solely on training data and<br/>ignore existing scientific knowledge have met with limited success in scientific problems, particularly<br/>when labeled data is limited, sometimes even leading to spectacular failures. This is because the black<br/>box ML models are susceptible to learning spurious relationships that do not generalize well outside the<br/>data they are trained for. The emerging paradigm of physics-guided machine learning (PGML), which<br/>leverages the unique ability of ML algorithms to automatically extract patterns and models from data with<br/>guidance of the knowledge accumulated in physics (or scientific theories), aims to address the challenges<br/>faced by black box ML in scientific applications.<br/><br/>For data science, PGML has the potential to transform ML beyond black-box applications by enabling<br/>solutions that generalize well even on unseen input-output distributions that are different from those<br/>encountered during training, by anchoring ML methods with the scientific body of knowledge. PGML makes a distinct<br/>departure from the conventional view that physics-based models and ML models are developed in<br/>isolation but seldom mixed together. The proposed project is fundamentally different from existing body<br/>of research that attempts to combine ML and domain sciences, e.g., by making use of domain-specific<br/>knowledge in ML algorithms in simplistic ways, or making use of data in the physics-based modeling<br/>process albeit without allowing data to change the functional forms of existing physics-based models. The tight interplay between data science and the domains of physics and sensing in the project lends itself<br/>naturally to diverse education activities that complement the research tasks outlined by our team. Over the<br/>duration of this one-year project, the team will develop an integrative course at the graduate level on ""ML<br/>meets Physics"", which explores topical, emerging themes in this interdisciplinary area. Offerings of the<br/>course will draw upon course modules shared between the four universities, such as shared guest videos<br/>and case studies. The physics department at BU has a well-developed ""Physics Outreach Project"" that<br/>annually performs science exhibitions for elementary schools in Binghamton metropolitan area, for which<br/>the team will create a new exhibition about neural networks and ML. In follow-on work, similar outreach<br/>events will be replicated at schools (Robinson Middle School in Lowell and Metro STEM Middle School<br/>in Columbus).

This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  COVID-19 presents a national threat to the health of children and families, presenting serious implications for the mental and physical health of children.  Child development scientists have already warned of increasing stress levels among the U.S. child population, especially those in low-income families of color. In addition, Latino children are disproportionately impoverished, and benefit from culturally relevant information. Parents and caregivers need to be armed with effective science-based strategies to improve child prospects during this global crisis. Harnessing well-established partnerships?including with local TV news partners and parent-serving organizations?strengthens the potential for broad impacts on the health and well-being of children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic persists, widely disseminating accurate research-based strategies to support parents and families, with a focus on low-income Latino parents, is crucial to meeting the needs of the nation?s most vulnerable during this global crisis. The award addresses this urgent need by producing research-based news videos on child development for distribution on broadcast television stations that reach low income Latino parents. The videos will communicate research-based recommendations regarding COVID-19 in ways that are relatable to Latino parents and lead to positive parenting during this pandemic. A ""how to"" video will also be produced showing parents how to implement some of the practices. Project partners include Abriendo Puertas, the largest U.S. parenting program serving low-income Latinos, and Ivanhoe Broadcasting.  <br/><br/>Research questions include:   1) What information do parents need (and potentially what misinformation they are being exposed to)? 2) What are they sharing? 3) How does this vary geographically? 4) Can researchers detect differences in public engagement in geographic areas where TV stations air news videos as compared to areas that don?t? This project will use data and communication science research strategies (e.g. natural language processing from online sites where parents are asking questions and sharing information) to inform the content of the videos and lead to the adoption of featured behaviors. Data from web searches, public Facebook pages, and Twitter posts will be used to gain a window into parents? main questions and concerns including information regarding hygiene, how to talk about the pandemic without frightening their children, or determining veracity of what they hear and see related to the pandemic.<br/><br/> This organic approach can detect concerns that parents may be unlikely to ask doctors or discuss in focus groups.  Methodologically, the researchers will accomplish this by natural language analysis of the topics that parents raise; the words and phrases they use to talk about specific content; and any references to external sources of information. Where possible, the researchers will segment this analysis by geography to see if there are geographical differences in information needs and discourse.  A research brief will share new knowledge gained with the field on how to respond to national emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, using local TV news and reinforcement of messages across contexts. The findings from this award will provide a knowledge base that can be utilized to better inform responses to national emergencies in the future. By broadly disseminating these findings through a research brief, the project?s innovative research will advance the field of communication science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will leverage insights into how to structure the required software so that the combinatorial explosion in software complexity remains manageable.  The outcome of the project will be a modern linear algebra software framework and application-focused libraries that will support future generations of computational applications in academia, at the national labs, and in industry.  In addition, the project will impact the training of the next generation of high-performance computing professions and help remove barriers into the field for members of traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The proposed work will build on previous NSF-sponsored research in order to address the implementation of expanded precision (EP), mixed precision (MP), and mixed domain (MD) algorithms simultaneously in a single software solution.

In the US, schools and closed, yet there is variability across states and cities regarding pandemic recommendation on social distancing.  The situation likely affects different children in different ways, due to varying levels of familial financial impact, self or family COVID-19 illness, mental health effects of social distancing and stress, online activity, scholastic activity, adult supervision, and indirect health influences of altered physical activity, sleep, and access to nutrition.  The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development project (ABCD) is a longitudinal study of 11,878 diverse youth enrolled at ages 9-10 in 2016-2018 (birth years 2006-2009) at 21 research sites around the United States.  This RAPID project will design and implement a new survey, to assess personal impact of COVID-19 on ABCD participants and families. With this new information, we can leverage existing ABCD data to examine perturbations in developmental trajectories of brain functioning, neurocognition, mental health, substance use, academic achievement, and social functioning. By immediately collecting a unique set of measures that characterize the pandemic?s effects, we can make use of the existing ABCD protocol and design in this large, diverse, national sample.  Results from this study will provide substantially improved guidelines for future epidemics and pandemics, and indicate potential targets for interventions when other traumas affect children.<br/><br/>The ABCD cohort is being followed until at least age 20, with: biennial state-of-the-art neuroimaging, epigenetics/genetics, and physical activity tracking; annual cognitive testing and assessments with youth and parents on mental and physical health and development, life events and trauma exposure, culture and environment, substance use, sleep, and screen time; and biannual brief assessments of mental health and substance use.  The proposed research would immediately characterize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on each child via a youth and parent self-assessment that characterizes their personal level of family disruption, social distancing and its impact, attitudes, adherence to public health directives, and media exposure. This crisis provides a unique opportunity to make use of ABCD?s elaborate infrastructure and rigorous scientific processes to discern critical dimensions of behavior not previously envisioned. The impending severity of this unanticipated pandemic may result in significant influences on school-age youth for decades, and this RAPID will be critical to characterizing factors that protect and exacerbate its effects.

As COVID-19 continues to spread, the effectiveness of different testing strategies and predictive models are brought into question. Testing strategies include the use of drive-through facilities that have found success elsewhere but may prove impractical for elderly and low-income sections of the population, and the use of hospitals, which adds further burden to the healthcare system and may carry the risk of higher contagion. Mathematical models that forecast the spread of the disease are of paramount importance to inform local and global policy makers on the course of action that should be undertaken to mitigate the outbreak and give relief to the population. However, such models are often confounded by the absence of symptoms in early stages, complex mobility patterns, and limited testing resources. This award supports fundamental research toward a mathematical model that will overcome these confounding factors, through advancements in dynamics and control. By explicitly modeling social and mobility constraints, this research will help increase the general well-being of communities and reduce disparities across the population. The model will afford the simulation of critical what-if scenarios and will include the evaluation of different testing policies and mitigation actions, thereby constituting a valuable support to policy makers involved in the containment and eradication of the epidemic. Research outcomes will be presented to the public, including health professionals and authorities to inform public policy in the ongoing crisis.<br/><br/>The research will respond to COVID-19 outbreak in real time through a fine-resolution agent-based and data-driven model that aims at providing unprecedented insight in the spread and potential mitigation strategies of this virus at the city level. The approach will afford thorough what-if analysis on the effectiveness of ongoing and potential mitigation strategies. The agent-based model will include COVID-19 specific features, such as the type and timing of testing, asymptomatic occurrence, and hospitalization stages. The framework will be grounded in publicly available census and geo-referred data from New Rochelle, New York.  Social behavior associated with rational and irrational factors will be included in the mobility patterns of the agent-based model at multiple spatial and temporal scales to increase the granularity of the predictions. Network-theoretic and data-driven control strategies will inform enhanced testing protocols involving active trials on the basis of available contact databases collected at testing sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Almost overnight, families have had to develop and support new practices for learning at home as districts scramble to meet the academic, social and emotional needs of their communities.  It is essential to collect data now to develop a deeper understanding of how schools and families are adapting to these changes and will continue to do so in coming weeks/months - the troubles they encounter, and the solutions they generate. Retrospective accounts may mask critical features of what was experienced, minimizing the country?s capacity to conceptualize and build more robust, equitable and transformative learning ecologies for the future.  Emphasizing an equity approach to solution development, this research will document how families engage in creative practices to generate powerful learning based on local needs, values, contexts, and histories in this present crisis. It will address the following questions: (1) What resources are schools providing and how are parents navigating and extending these resources to sustain their child?s learning? (2) How are families exploring science and math concepts related to the pandemic? (3) How are parents and families learning to adapt (e.g. communication with teachers; broader social networks) and what challenges do they face (e.g. subscription costs; reliable Internet)? (4) How are digital resources for STEM, curated by the research team, utilized for learning? <br/><br/>Emergency school closures are exposing significant gaps in access to the Internet and communication devices, and the capacity of parents/caregivers and communities to capitalize on technology to sustain health-relevant learning in a time of crisis. This project will use a novel, remote-diary tool based on a smartphone-enabled data collection platform, to reach families across the country. Mobile-phone-enabled remote diary tools make it possible to reach families who are under-connected, not just those with robust technical infrastructure. The data collected will lay the groundwork for creating new socio-technical support systems informed by diverse families? experiences, as the crisis unfolds. Approximately 200 parents with school age children (early and upper elementary grades) living at home will be recruited. This study and a  subsequent virtual workshop with other researchers who are also using remote methods to study learning will help establish a broader research agenda to specify the conditions under which socio-technical systems productively augment a family?s capacity to innovate and learn when traditional co-located school settings disappear.

Currently, methods to measure airway inflammation and disease control are difficult.  Recent innovation in breath analysis has provided opportunity to better understand airway disease.  However, the reach of these innovations has been limited due to cost and availability. Chronic lower respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and pulmonary hypertension are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and a leading cause of death worldwide across all countries and income levels. There is an urgent need for methods to better monitor and manage these chronic lower respiratory diseases to improve survival and patients? quality of life. Using an advanced chemical system, the proposed technology will measure a biomarker of inflammation in exhaled breath condensate (EBC).  Success of this project will deeply impact fundamental pulmonary research and create broad societal value by improving health and reducing burdens on the healthcare system. This will be particularly valuable to underserved urban communities where poor air quality leads to increased severity of respiratory diseases. This product also has significant commercial potential, with the ability to reduce costs and streamline treatment in an industry valued over $100 B annually.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and implement an advanced proprietary automated chemiluminescent reagent mixing and detector system for instantaneous measurement of airway inflammation by real-time breath analysis. Hydrogen peroxide reports on airway inflammation, which is a critical factor in respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but is difficult to accurately measure at the point-of-care. The current methods of choice include highly invasive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), time-consuming and costly laboratory hydrogen peroxide assays, or fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), which provides an incomplete picture of airway inflammation. This project will fill this analysis gap and provide a valuable solution to monitoring airway inflammation in patients at the point-of-care. The proposed aims for developing a system to measure exhaled hydrogen peroxide in Phase I will include: a cartridge-based reagent delivery and mixing designed to optimize limit of detection and reproducibility; a robust and compact reader equipped with optimized photon detection technology and built-in vortex mixer; and careful analysis of sensitivity and selectivity for hydrogen peroxide versus potentially interfering analytes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As it spreads through the human population the virus mutates producing proteins that can lead to higher infection rates (infectivity), and an increased ability to cause severe disease (virulence). This project will predict the most likely mutations of the virus by combining methods from machine learning, mathematics and biophysics.   Specifically, the proteins resulting from viral mutations will be experimentally synthesized, and their infectivity and virulence will be tested by the project team through a collaboration with researchers in industry. This project benefits from unprecedented access to genomic data compiled on SARS-CoV-2, combined with a rich set of novel tools developed through interdisciplinary advances in data science, mathematics, and biophysics. The results of this project will build a pipeline capable of assisting the development of vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 while simultaneously advancing the fields of machine learning and mathematical virology. The project team is led by mathematicians, molecular biologists and biotechnology experts working in an interdisciplinary and collaborative setting. Students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained and will participate in publicly disseminating the findings and results of the project.<br/><br/> <br/>The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is believed to have originated as a bat virus and to have evolved through a combination of sequence mutations, recombination, and natural selection to be infectious in human hosts. Some of the most relevant sequence variations occurred in the S gene encoding the Spike (S) protein. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads through the human population, mutations of the S gene can potentially increase viral infectivity and virulence. Within the framework of an evolutionary algorithm, the PIs will combine graph theory, topological data analysis, and computational biophysics to characterize the most likely mutations of the S protein. This powerful interdisciplinary approach will draw upon existing experimental data from SARS-CoV-2. The PIs will collaborate with an industrial partner to experimentally design the peptides corresponding to those predicted sequences, and  use binding affinity assays and cryo-electron microscopy to test binding of the peptides to the human receptor (ACE2). The resulting pipeline will help us better understand the evolutionary landscape of viral proteins and will assist researchers in the development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines. Future extensions of this work will increase our understanding of how viruses are transmitted across species and propagate in humans.

These lavas can provide important information about what Earth?s uppermost (~ 120 miles) mantle is composed of and how it melts to form the majority of Earth?s crust. At present no studies have examined long chains of seamounts adjacent to mid-ocean ridges to address these fundamental questions. In this study, we plan to analyze over 400 well located lava samples from the 8°20'N seamount chain. The chain was previously sampled and mapped in 2016 and 2018 using the submersible Alvin and autonomous vehicle Sentry. The geochemical, mineralogical, and age data to be obtained under this project will allow us to determine the origin of the magmas that feed the seamounts and nearby ridge. The data will also tell us how those magmas evolve to form oceanic lavas, and how the volcanism is related to regional tectonic processes.  The study will promote advances in the field of geochemistry, marine geology, and geodynamics. This project will provide significant mentorship and training for students at a variety of levels.  It will fully or partially support three graduate students at Florida and Boise State and will provide training for several undergraduates in geochemical techniques and interpretation, and support senior research projects. The project will also support education and diversity by funding two female scientists, one a first-generation college graduate, toward obtaining their PhDs in geochemistry. Both principal investigators are heavily involved in outreach and education at the K-12 levels in Florida and Idaho.<br/><br/>Sparse sampling and geochemical analyses of seamounts scattered throughout the northeastern Pacific suggest the sub-ridge mantle associated with the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has far greater compositional variability then is preserved in lavas erupted on-axis. While the relative homogeneity of axial lavas has resulted in intriguing generalizations about magma differentiation and mixing processes at mid-ocean ridges (MOR), seamount studies have had a significant impact on our understanding of the source compositions for oceanic basalts, the scales of mantle heterogeneity, and mantle melting systematics at MOR. However, many of these studies have focused on dredged lavas from individual seamounts with very few combining in situ sampling and high-resolution mapping from a single chain oriented perpendicular to the ridge axis.  To fill this gap in knowledge about the sub-ridge mantle, two research cruises in 2016 and 2018 investigated the 8°20?N seamount chain that extends ~200km west of the EPR.  The 8°20?N seamount chain was unexplored and virtually unsampled before our highly successful OASIS cruises. Geophysical, observational, and preliminary geochemical data from this nearly continuous chain of volcanoes led us to unexpected discoveries about their construction and revealed extreme compositional variability in the near MOR mantle that was previously only surmised from regional seamount studies in the northeast Pacific. The location, orientation, and preliminary data from the 8°20'N seamount chain make it an ideal a natural laboratory to investigate source heterogeneity and melting systematics in the near-ridge mantle. We propose to study the petrologic processes and mantle sources feeding MOR and near-axis volcanoes though comprehensive geochemical analyses of lavas and melt inclusions from the 8°20?N seamounts. Site-specific sampling using HOV Alvin and extensive, fine-scale mapping with AUV Sentry along the seamount chain, coupled with our previous comprehensive investigations of the 8°- 10°N EPR provide an exceptional opportunity to constrain geodynamic and geochemical models of mantle melting near MOR and determine the extent and length scales of mantle heterogeneity. We propose to collect a wide spectrum of petrologic and geochemical data including Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os isotopes, melt inclusion compositions, volatile contents, and 40Ar/39Ar age dates of lavas from the extensive collection of samples we have from the 8°20?N seamount chain. These results will be combined with numerical models to produce a petrologic model of mantle melting and magmatic processes in the near-ridge mantle. This extensive off-axis seamount chain provides a rare opportunity to probe the compositions of the mantle near MOR and to understand how magmas are spatially and temporally distributed in the shallow mantle and crust. Results from this research have implications for the generation of the majority of Earth?s crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Critical to managing any pandemic is the accurate estimation of how many people are infected within communities. SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, is excreted in the stool of infected individuals, eventually ending up in the wastewater treatment plant. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human waste presents the opportunity to potentially monitor wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the number of infections in the community and provide an ?early warning system? for future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The goal of this research is to develop methods to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and to connect these measurements to epidemiology models. In addition, the project team will coordinate wastewater monitoring efforts for SARS-CoV-2 globally. If successful, this research could lead to other similar monitoring efforts for other viral outbreaks and protect the health of the Nation. <br/> <br/>SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., 2019-nCoV) is identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness that is now a global  pandemic causing significant disruption to medical services and commerce. Significant uncertainties about the prevalence of this virus remain. This information which is vital to inform control recommendations and determine the case fatality rate. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool raises the possibility of using wastewater-based epidemiological approaches to estimate the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. In this approach, molecular quantification of SARS-CoV-2 will be combined with epidemiological data to model outbreak dynamics and estimate the overall prevalence of the virus in the community over time. These data will be integrated into epidemiological models using data from public health surveillance. Data from wastewater could inform epidemiological estimates on finer spatial scales than epidemiological data and could provide indications of continued community transmission following the initial wave of the pandemic. The potential for this virus to become a seasonally transmitted endemic pathogen like influenza and other coronaviruses would make this type of analysis increasingly informative. Technical developments resulting from this research include improved sample handling methods, molecular quantification approaches, integration of the resulting data into epidemiological models, as well as coordination with domestic and international collaborators to standardize methodology. There is significant scientific interest in using wastewater to monitor for SARS-CoV-2 beyond the current outbreak. This research will inform such efforts and help respond to future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will leverage insights into how to structure the required software so that the combinatorial explosion in software complexity remains manageable.  The outcome of the project will be a modern linear algebra software framework and application-focused libraries that will support future generations of computational applications in academia, at the national labs, and in industry.

In physics, there remain open challenges to understanding how physical quantities like charge, heat, and even information evolve and undergo transport in systems of many interacting particles, especially when quantum effects are taken into account. Recently, new approaches to the study of transport in quantum systems have emerged based on the concepts of ""synthetic dimensions"" and ""synthetic lattices,"" in which our normal picture of transport in real space is abstracted to the transport of population in a space spanned by the internal states of small quantum systems such as individual atoms or molecules. For example, population can ""move"" between the electronic states of an atom (like hydrogen) through the absorption of light from an incident laser field.  In this way, a collection of atoms, which is well-understood and highly controllable with lasers or other electromagnetic fields, can be used to ""simulate"" a more complex condensed matter system, and lead to advances in our understanding of the complex system. The experimental effort in the current project will extend this type of approach to the study of transport to a new regime of strong inter-particle interactions. The team will conduct experiments based on samples of atoms that can be individually controlled and detected at the microscopic level. Microwave electromagnetic fields will be used to precisely control the transport of population between states of the atoms, allowing for new kinds of explorations into transport phenomena. Additionally, the team will lead an effort to broaden the scope and impact of undergraduate research opportunities, with a primary emphasis on increasing the participation of members from underrepresented groups. This effort will focus on building a new, undergraduate student-led research project on networks of mechanical oscillators that are coupled by ""synthetic,"" or engineered and indirect, forces. This effort will incorporate undergraduates from diverse backgrounds in cutting-edge research related to new kinds of transport phenomena, and will use these human-scale experiments to generate visualization video content that will be utilized for outreach and instruction.<br/><br/>This project builds on previous work designing synthetic lattices in neutral atoms and photons, extending these ideas to a new platform for the exploration of many-body transport phenomena based on the internal degrees of freedom of ultracold Rydberg atoms. By considering the problem of quantum transport taking place in an internal state space (driven by coherent microwave transitions and strong dipole-dipole interactions) rather than real space, this approach leverages the ability to manipulate internal degrees of freedom with spectroscopic control. This spectroscopic control allows for the precise engineering of synthetic lattices with nontrivial band topology, kinetic frustration, and tunable disorder. Resonant dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms will lead to new phenomena with relevance to the interplay of topology and strong interactions, to the study of relaxation and thermalization in isolated interacting disordered systems, and perhaps to the emergence of entirely new forms of many-body phenomena. The research team will explore the ability to engineer novel synthetic lattice models in the internal state space of Rydberg atoms, and will explore how resonant dipole-dipole interactions lead to new many-body phenomena in these synthetic lattices. An additional effort related to broadening the scope and impact of undergraduate research will lead a project to create topological lattice models based on synthetically-coupled oscillator networks. This research effort will enable new functionality of engineered mechanical networks, including new capabilities for designing non-reciprocity, artificial gauge fields, disorder, and strong nonlinearities. The undergraduate led research team will use these newly developed methods to study transport phenomena in new classes of mechanical oscillator networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key scientific goal concerning COVID-19 is to develop mathematical models that help in understanding and predicting its spreading behavior, as well as supporting guidelines on what can be done to limit its spread. In this project, the PIs aim to achieve these goals by applying their recent findings on a new epidemic model to the spread of COVID-19. The PIs will work on a model that considers the possibility of COVID-19 mutating into different strains with different spreading characteristics. By also considering changes in the spreading behavior of COVID-19 due to environmental factors and changes in human behavior (seasonal changes, travel bans, etc.), they aim to obtain results that will help assess the effectiveness of countermeasures that can be taken against the spread of the virus and to help better prepare for different mutation scenarios, including worst-cases. <br/>Most existing models of epidemics assume that an infectious individual passes the same pathogen strain that she was infected with to a susceptible individual in her contact network. This assumption may not hold in real-life as pathogens often evolve over time, and the ways a pathogen evolves might lead to significant changes in its spreading dynamics. This project aims to improve the state-of-the-art mathematical and computational models for predicting the spread of COVID-19 to incorporate the effects of evolution and mutations. This will be done by leveraging recent work of the PIs in which they developed a mathematical model to predict the spreading dynamics for multiple-strain epidemics models with mutations. By incorporating the potential changes in the reproduction number R0 (due to countermeasures or mutations), the PIs aim to obtain a better understanding of the future progress of the COVID-19 spread; obtain different predictions of the spread of COVID-19 under different scenarios including extensive bans on travel, school/shop closures, as well as potential evolution into different strains; and add to the public discourse on the expected effectiveness of various countermeasures that can be taken to slow down the spread of COVID-19. Project outcomes will be disseminated broadly and incorporated into teaching curricula. The project will also engage students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydraulic fracturing requires pumping of millions of gallons of water into a reservoir to create permeable pathways within the rock, and increase hydrocarbon recovery rates. However, hydraulic fracturing technology has been banned in some regions within the United States, and in various countries across the globe due to water scarcity and environmental concerns. This has left trillions of dollars in petroleum resources trapped within the earth, negatively impacting the global economy. The waterless fracturing technology being developed under this project utilizes pulsed electrical energy to fracture rocks instead of water, allowing for hydrocarbons to be recovered with minimum environmental impact. The research conducted during this project will provide further insights into the advantages of utilizing electricity to fracture petroleum reservoirs and assist in accelerating successful commercialization of the technology.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a novel electric reservoir stimulation method to increase reservoir permeability without requiring pumping of hazardous material into the subsurface. This project will advance the development of an electric stimulation method by testing it on rock samples under higher pressure and temperature conditions, to mimic the downhole conditions of several common petroleum reservoirs and allow for optimization.

The work will result in concrete approaches for quantifying uncertainty of possible outcomes and provide reliable tools to assist decision makers in designing mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, a new statistical inference tool will be developed to estimate the key epidemic parameters that describe the nature of the COVID-19 spread in an interpretable manner. These parameters are critical for providing reliable forecasts through real-time simulation of potential outbreaks. The new models will analyze the effects of changing social contact structures on the spread of COVID-19, and account for missing or partial data in a systematic way. The results of this project will contribute to the scientific and mathematical approaches needed to provide effective and quick understanding of future epidemics or relevant phenomena.<br/><br/>Existing epidemic models largely rely on deterministic systems that are unable to quantify the uncertainty critical for decision making. In addition, data analysis and predictive modeling for the COVID-19 pandemic require statistical tools for fitting epidemic models with only partially available data.

To address this gap, the project team will develop new stochastic compartmental models that extend classical approaches to explicitly account for changes to the social contact network underlying the disease spread. These new developments will be accompanied by likelihood-based methods to infer key epidemic parameters that offer mechanistic interpretations with uncertainty quantification. In particular, missing data such as infection times at the individual level will be accounted for via novel data augmentation techniques.

Recent predictions suggest that without serious interventions, a large portion of the world population will become infected, resulting in millions of deaths. To mitigate this worst-case scenario, key policy decisions are being guided by mathematical models. However, several prominent models make unrealistic assumptions about human contacts i.e., that an individual is equally likely to infect a close family member as a complete stranger on the other side of the country. Such assumptions are useful for calculations, but fail to take into account the full geographic complexity of the outbreak. Furthermore, many models do not consider the consequences of the quarantine of healthy individuals. This project will use rigorous analysis and simulation to address these shortcomings by describing a more realistic structure of quarantined networks and how disease spreads in them. The proposed research will use real-world data about contact networks to make predictions and recommendations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, improving our understanding of how best to contain the current as well as future pandemics. The project will involve the training of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will describe the effect of quarantine on connectivity and disease transmission on more realistic networks than have previously been considered. Of particular importance will be locating critical thresholds which, when exceeded, allow large epidemics to occur. There is recent study of these thresholds, but for networks that model digital infrastructure and social networks. The first objective of the research will be to determine the effect of biased site percolation on graph structure, especially how different percolation rules influence the size of the largest component of a given graph. The second part will then focus on how the critical threshold and size of the epidemic for an SIR model change after percolation. This will be explored rigorously on graphs generated from the configuration model as well as random spatial networks such as Gilbert graphs. Additionally, these questions will be investigated on real world face-to-face networks using data specific to the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The project will integrate results from a regional traverse across several sedimentary basins with the record of magmatism across Ecuador, the narrowest segment of the Andes.  A range of analytical techniques will be employed to determine the timing of major shifts in basin development, sediment sources, and past drainages, and to recognize periods of crustal thickening, changes in sources of magmatism, and the influence of accreted oceanic crust.  The study will provide insights into the geologic processes and geohazards along ocean-continent subduction plate boundaries, offering information that will benefit society by improving risk assessment and infrastructure planning.  The project will also catalyze new academic collaborations within the framework of international learning experiences that will facilitate longer term collaborations between US and Ecuadorian researchers, including development of shared undergraduate and graduate geoscience field-course and field-trip opportunities.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, competing perspectives have emerged on the tectonic evolution of Cordilleran ocean-continent plate boundaries, including the geologic history of the Andes, the global archetype for Cordilleran convergent systems.  Debate largely originates from contrasting emphases on different regions (forearc vs. retroarc) and different components (basins vs. magmatic arc vs. fold-thrust belt) of Cordilleran systems.  This project will incorporate analytical techniques, such as sedimentary basin analysis, isotope geochemistry, petrology, and U-Pb geochronology, to identify potentially coupled episodic phases of basin evolution and arc magmatism that may be linked to internally driven orogenic processes (including underthrusting, high-flux magmatism, and buildup then foundering of crustal/lithospheric roots), or externally driven tectonic processes including fluctuating slab dynamics (cycles of subduction shallowing vs. steepening and associated rapid vs. diminished shortening and subsidence) and oceanic terrane accretion.  Ecuador contains an important yet underappreciated record of tectonic quiescence or possible extension during what has been long regarded as uninterrupted Cenozoic shortening, thickening, and uplift along the entire Andean margin.  Such a fluctuating pattern of mountain building may govern the structural and stratigraphic evolution of many ocean-continent convergent margins, with implications for the tectonic regimes of subduction and collisional systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to the World Health Organization, ?SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact between an infector and an infectee?.  A recent study has shown that these virions can be airborne for at least 30 minutes and be active on the aerosol droplets up to three hours.  Non-pharmaceutical protection is essential to stunt the spread of this virus. As of March 19, 2020, the Center for Disease Control?s official guidelines include non-optimal reuse of surgical masks for extended periods of time.  Then, on March 27, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a critical emergency on personal protection equipment.  The reuse of masks puts healthcare workers, first line responders, patients, and the community at risk. The aim of this research project between the University of Texas-Austin and the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital is to develop and implement a rapid protocol for extended use of surgical and N95 masks.  The researchers will develop a fast, simple procedure for turning passive masks into active protective gear.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses a critical need to improve personal protection equipment during the coronavirus crisis. A new extended use protocol for masks will render immediate benefits to the healthcare community.  An enhanced mechanistic understanding of virion capture and inactivation at nano-bio interfaces will have wide applicability in the design of personal protective equipment. This research project has the following objectives: (i) obtain masks from the Shands hospital, treat them with surfactants, ultraviolet-C ray, and steam, and then characterize the efficacy of each treatment using viability tests, (ii) modify mask surfaces with surfactant-modified (sodium lauryl sulfate, butadines, or stearoyl lactylate) carbon particles (activated carbon, carbon quantum dots, or nano-diamond) at different ratios and moisture content and then test their efficacy in attaching and inactivating coronaviruses, (iii) understand the mechanisms of virus attachment and inactivation, and (iv) implement a rapid extended mask-use program.

Disaster research is often by necessity retrospective, providing accounts of past actions and ongoing recoveries. The temporal profile of the COVID-19 pandemic presents an opportunity for social research in the middle of an unfolding crisis, providing contemporaneous insights into risk perception and sensemaking under duress, community and organizational resilience, transformations in social structure, and real time adaptations to severe economic and social dislocations. Concentrating on New York City, this project will create a contemporaneous record of the city?s battle with COVID-19 across the epidemic curve. New York is a critical site for understanding the course of this pandemic because it was an early epicenter of the disease in the U.S., because it has a robust municipal emergency management system with deep experience of past disasters, health-related and otherwise, and because it is home to one of the nation?s strongest urban healthcare systems. The project will provide real time findings about New York City that will be relevant to jurisdictions in earlier phases along the arc of the pandemic, thus assisting other governmental leaders in planning effective responses. This project will also rigorously document the COVID-19 emergency to better understand how it is unfolding, to better inform the recovery, and to learn lessons that will aid our fight against the next pandemic and other extreme events. These findings will be critical to leaders at all levels of government so as to promote the safety and security of U.S. residents in the years ahead.<br/><br/>The current COVID-19 pandemic challenges community and organizational resilience and necessitates transformations in social structure.  To analyze these changes, this project combines three approaches to data gathering that capture the evolving and multi-dimensional impact of the COVID-19 crisis on New Yorkers. First, a survey of 1,000 people will track shifts in stress responses, helping behaviors, social isolation, and resilience. Demographic data gathered from the survey will inform and refine recruitment of new participants. The sample will be stratified across different scales of the response: everyday New Yorkers, frontline workers--including first and second responders, critical infrastructure and other essential workers--and strategic level decision makers, managers, and planners. These results will be complemented by data from a diary study with 500 participants, and a sequence of oral history interviews with 200 narrators at expanding intervals, to produce a rich longitudinal perspective on the relationship between micro shifts in attitudes and relations, and macro transformations in urban structures and dynamics. Findings will inform sociological theories regarding the relationship between micro- and macro-levels of social organization, disaster preparedness and response, risk perception and social stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These lavas can provide important information about what Earth?s uppermost (~ 120 miles) mantle is composed of and how it melts to form the majority of Earth?s crust. At present no studies have examined long chains of seamounts adjacent to mid-ocean ridges to address these fundamental questions. In this study, we plan to analyze over 400 well located lava samples from the 8°20'N seamount chain. The chain was previously sampled and mapped in 2016 and 2018 using the submersible Alvin and autonomous vehicle Sentry. The geochemical, mineralogical, and age data to be obtained under this project will allow us to determine the origin of the magmas that feed the seamounts and nearby ridge. The data will also tell us how those magmas evolve to form oceanic lavas, and how the volcanism is related to regional tectonic processes.  The study will promote advances in the field of geochemistry, marine geology, and geodynamics. This project will provide significant mentorship and training for students at a variety of levels.  It will fully or partially support three graduate students at Florida and Boise State and will provide training for several undergraduates in geochemical techniques and interpretation, and support senior research projects. The project will also support education and diversity by funding two female scientists, one a first-generation college graduate, toward obtaining their PhDs in geochemistry. Both principal investigators are heavily involved in outreach and education at the K-12 levels in Florida and Idaho.<br/><br/>Sparse sampling and geochemical analyses of seamounts scattered throughout the northeastern Pacific suggest the sub-ridge mantle associated with the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has far greater compositional variability then is preserved in lavas erupted on-axis. While the relative homogeneity of axial lavas has resulted in intriguing generalizations about magma differentiation and mixing processes at mid-ocean ridges (MOR), seamount studies have had a significant impact on our understanding of the source compositions for oceanic basalts, the scales of mantle heterogeneity, and mantle melting systematics at MOR. However, many of these studies have focused on dredged lavas from individual seamounts with very few combining in situ sampling and high-resolution mapping from a single chain oriented perpendicular to the ridge axis.  To fill this gap in knowledge about the sub-ridge mantle, two research cruises in 2016 and 2018 investigated the 8°20?N seamount chain that extends ~200km west of the EPR.  The 8°20?N seamount chain was unexplored and virtually unsampled before our highly successful OASIS cruises. Geophysical, observational, and preliminary geochemical data from this nearly continuous chain of volcanoes led us to unexpected discoveries about their construction and revealed extreme compositional variability in the near MOR mantle that was previously only surmised from regional seamount studies in the northeast Pacific. The location, orientation, and preliminary data from the 8°20'N seamount chain make it an ideal a natural laboratory to investigate source heterogeneity and melting systematics in the near-ridge mantle. We propose to study the petrologic processes and mantle sources feeding MOR and near-axis volcanoes though comprehensive geochemical analyses of lavas and melt inclusions from the 8°20?N seamounts. Site-specific sampling using HOV Alvin and extensive, fine-scale mapping with AUV Sentry along the seamount chain, coupled with our previous comprehensive investigations of the 8°- 10°N EPR provide an exceptional opportunity to constrain geodynamic and geochemical models of mantle melting near MOR and determine the extent and length scales of mantle heterogeneity. We propose to collect a wide spectrum of petrologic and geochemical data including Sr, Nd, Pb, and Os isotopes, melt inclusion compositions, volatile contents, and 40Ar/39Ar age dates of lavas from the extensive collection of samples we have from the 8°20?N seamount chain. These results will be combined with numerical models to produce a petrologic model of mantle melting and magmatic processes in the near-ridge mantle. This extensive off-axis seamount chain provides a rare opportunity to probe the compositions of the mantle near MOR and to understand how magmas are spatially and temporally distributed in the shallow mantle and crust.

These molecules are formed by surrounding transition metal ions by organic groups (ligands) capable of inducing a change in the magnetic state at the metal center.  Magnetic state switching in molecular solids is largely unexplored and holds potential to develop into stimuli-responsive materials that could be used in new sensors and catalytic systems.  The project will also explore the use of these molecules for the preparation of solids that combine magnetic state switching with electrical conductivity. Such multifunctional materials can be useful for the design of next-generation electronic devices and light-activated switches. The project will provide diverse research experiences to graduate and undergraduate students, including students from groups underrepresented in physical sciences. The outreach efforts include organizing nationwide undergraduate summer schools in magnetism and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.<br/><br/>This project targets the synthesis and extensive characterization of spin-state switching materials based on the combination of Fe(II) ions with non-innocent (redox-active) organic ligands. The mechanism of the spin-state transition induced by a reversible electron transfer between an outer-sphere moiety and the coordinated ligand is largely unexplored. Establishing conditions that lead to such spin-state switching phenomena may open a new class of stimuli-responsive molecules, capable of translating temperature-, pressure-, or light-induced outer-sphere electron transfer into dramatic changes in the magnetic and structural states of the system. The team will systematically explore the design and synthesis of such complexes, followed by their detailed characterization by X-ray structural analysis, magnetic property measurements, and various types of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The behavior of complexes will be studied under various external perturbations to establish the conditions that lead to spin-state switching. These stimuli-responsive molecules will be co-crystallized with anionic organic radicals to obtain hybrid multifunctional materials that combine spin-state switching with electrical conductivity. Changes in the spin configuration at the metal center typically lead to significant atomic displacements that propagate through the entire structure. The possibility to translate such structural perturbations at the magnetically active metal center to the organic substructure and modulate conductivity via spin-state switching is especially appealing if it can be stimulated by light irradiation. Beyond the discovery of a new class of stimuli-responsive complexes and materials, the findings expected from this project will be also of value to the areas of catalysis and bioinorganic chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inclusion of an elementary mathematics specialist on a team of teachers has potential to systemically improve mathematics education, build students? mathematical capacity to succeed, and increase student achievement in mathematics.  Too few students in the U.S. are attaining high levels of mathematics learning, compounded by persisting gaps in mathematics achievement.  This project aims to improve mathematics teacher effectiveness and teacher leadership in elementary schools in which many students have great economic needs and are from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.  The project focuses on the recruitment, preparation, support, and retention of elementary mathematics specialists who deliver rigorous mathematics instruction and serve as mathematics teacher leaders. <br/> <br/>This project at Georgia State University includes partnerships with the metro Atlanta school district Gwinnett County Public Schools and the nonprofit Corners Outreach.  Project goals include to: (1) recruit successful, experienced, and diverse elementary mathematics teachers from high-need schools that serve underrepresented student populations to become elementary mathematics specialists; (2) increase the number of elementary mathematics specialists in these schools through evidence-based preparation in two university endorsement programs; (3) develop elementary mathematics specialists who are highly effective mathematics teachers and teacher leaders; and (4) support and retain elementary mathematics specialists as they serve as teacher leaders, including coaching university teacher candidates, in these schools.  This five-year project will involve 26 in-service elementary teachers, aiming to promote mathematics equity and access, support teacher retention in high-need schools, and situate teacher candidates in a hiring pipeline.  The project's teachers will be prepared and supported as elementary mathematics specialists through completion of the K-5 Mathematics Endorsement and Teacher Support & Coaching Endorsement. In addition to completing these two endorsements, teachers will also engage in a Professional Learning Community and one-on-one mentoring.  Evaluation and research involving mixed methods will demonstrate how the intentional and continuous project components affect the mathematical content knowledge, instructional practices, beliefs, and teacher leader skills of elementary mathematics specialists.  Results have the potential to advance understandings in the areas of mathematics teacher education and professional development, particularly of elementary mathematics specialists in high-need schools. This Track 3: Master Teacher Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce).

Starch is the major carbon storage form of plants, a main source of calories in the human diet, and an important raw material for various industrial applications. Despite the importance of starch in biological systems and in human society, our understanding of the regulation of starch metabolism is surprisingly limited and far from complete. Transitory starch, a primary product of photosynthesis, accumulates in plant leaves during the day, and is degraded at night to provide energy for cellular activities and plant growth. Starch degradation is a complex process that requires the combined activity of several protein families including glucan phosphatases, glucan dikinases, and amylases. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding how these proteins specifically contribute to starch degradation. This research project will investigate the role that glucan phosphatases play in initiating and regulating transitory starch degradation. A complete understanding of the molecular events that control starch degradation is necessary to define novel strategies to improve starch yields in crops, a raw material for biofuel and various industrial and agricultural applications. Undergraduate researchers working on this project, some of whom will be from underrepresented and minority populations, will be provided the opportunity to engage in structural biochemistry and metabolomics research, travel to national conferences to present their work, and collaborate closely with experts in the field. Thus, this project will provide mentorship and training for the next generation of scientists and help retain both underserved and underrepresented students in the sciences. This research will also contribute to biochemistry undergraduate education through the design of a project-based laboratory course. Overall, the project represents a robust combination of advancing foundational research, improving undergraduate education, and positively impacting future agricultural and industrial applications.<br/><br/>Starch is an insoluble polymer of glucose. Phosphorylation of the starch outer glucosyl residues by glucan dikinases makes the starch granule partially water soluble and accessible to starch degrading enzymes such as ?-amylases. The subsequent removal of phosphate groups by glucan phosphatases is necessary for complete starch breakdown. By employing a variety of structural, biophysical, and biochemical techniques, the project will investigate the various steps in starch dephosphorylation and its undefined roles in regulating starch degradation. Specifically, the project aims to understand 1) the mechanisms by which glucan phosphatases contribute to the regulation of starch degradation; 2) the structural basis of glucan dephosphorylation at the starch granule; and 3) the critical roles of starch dephosphorylation in diurnal starch metabolism. By employing metabolomics, the project will explore the direct and indirect roles of starch phosphorylation in starch metabolism under abiotic stress. The results of this research project will help close the knowledge gap in understanding the roles and regulatory mechanisms of the glucan phosphatase family of enzymes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.   The major public policy of social distancing relies, in part, on the cooperation of younger and healthier people who may not experience symptoms and can spread the virus unknowingly to more vulnerable populations. Science journalists, who are on the front lines of covering the pandemic, can play an important role in educating millennial audiences about the science behind the virus, how it is transmitted and effective ways to prevent the virus from spreading.  This award will help the STEM field better understand how to engage millennial audiences with effective COVID-19 media content and to urgently capture professional knowledge on crisis reporting.  KQED and Texas Tech University are suited to rapidly implement a science media informal science learning project targeting millennials and younger audiences in light of their current NSF-funded ""Cracking the Code: Influencing Millennial Science Engagement"" collaborative research and evaluation project (DRL 1810990 and 1811091). The project team has built a functional research protocol for its media practitioner and academic researcher collaboration, and  will apply these new RAPID funds to complement on-going efforts, mobilize the existing team, research protocol, and  research tools to respond to the communication challenge of reaching younger adults posed by COVID-19.  Content to be created includes:  1) Radio broadcasts - daily news coverage, live talks; 2) A real-time blog - live Coronavirus updates and 3) Social media content on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.<br/><br/>The project team will explore the following research questions:<br/>1) How could COVID-19 coverage be designed to best inform, engage and educate millennials and younger audiences about the science of virus transmission and prevention?<br/>2) What are some best practices for crisis reporting, as journalists respond to both constantly updated information and changing audience needs, that can be used by media outlets (such as advisors PBS Digital Studios, PBS NewsHour, NOVA, NPR Science, and more)?  <br/><br/>The research protocol centers around ""media testing cycles,"" which are time-bounded studies (5 months long) exploring a subset of research questions about the effectiveness of KQED's science content (articles, videos, social media posts and radio reporting) at reaching younger audiences. Steps include identifying problems that are suited for empirical examination; formulating plausible competing hypotheses on the nature of those problems and their potential solutions; and crafting study designs calculated to support valid, realistic inferences on the relative strength of those hypotheses. Data will be gathered from COVID-19 audience ""chatter"" from Twitter and Facebook through Crimson Hexagon, a social media listening platform. In addition to the social media listening, researchers will conduct a thematic analysis of the questions currently being collected through the audience engagement platform Hearken, where KQED has gathered nearly 2,000 questions to date about the virus and lifestyle changes. This data will also help the project team understand knowledge gaps about prevention and transmission of the virus. These two qualitative studies will be conducted concurrently and reported to KQED journalists quickly to inform reporting.<br/><br/>Texas Tech researchers will create a virus transmission and prevention knowledge assessment. This assessment will be validated using a national online survey. The project will examine knowledge differences based on, for example, generation and gender. TTU will examine relationships between performance on this assessment and two relevant measures: science curiosity and ordinary science intelligence. The national survey will help identify what knowledge gaps are present in which audiences.

The beachhead market for this technology is the performance bicycle spoke market, which is a $180M global market. The potential benefits of this technology go beyond cycling because the polymer-to-metal interface has other potential applications. Cable assemblies are used in a wide variety of applications and industries such as industrial, aerospace, construction, and consumer goods. Advances in the termination of synthetic cable assemblies will enable the creation of higher strength-to-weight ratio cables and thereby increase efficiencies in transportation applications and improve the safety of tension based systems. An application of particular societal benefit is wheelchair wheels, where weight reduction increases portability for those with physical disabilities. Investment in termination technologies for high performance polymers will also help bridge the gap between polymer research and industry, helping society benefit from developments in polymer science occurring in academia. Finally, the ability to produce low-cost rope terminations will increase US manufacturing competitiveness because the majority of high-volume production is outsourced to low-cost labor markets.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced manufacturing process for ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and metal hybrid structures for bicycle spokes. UHMWPE has a strength-to-weight ratio of fifteen times that of steel, but it cannot be utilized in many applications because of the difficulty in manufacturing high-strength bonds to metal. The primary objectives of this research are to automate the insertion and bonding of stainless steel rods inside the hollow cavity of braided fibers, and to automate the creation of eye splices. These operations require delicate manipulation of fibers in a confined space, and are typically performed manually. Instead, we will develop novel automatic machinery that will create these bonds, inspect the final product, and validate the strength with 100% in-process inspection. Another objective of this research is to develop a black surface coating process for braided UHMWPE fibers. To achieve this, we will identify a surface pretreatment procedure to add functionality to the non-polar backbone of UHMWPE, develop the coating chemistry, and create an in-line coating system that integrates with our manufacturing process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term perspective of central MSEA variability from the proxy records will be synthesized with the simulations for a more dynamically-based understanding of past and future changes in atmospheric and upper-ocean properties throughout Southeast Asia and the Maritime Continent.<br/><br/>Specifically, the research team aims to use measurements of early and late wood width and density from blue light intensity in tree ring samples to reconstruct seasonal to multi-decadal records of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), rainfall, and boreal winter maximum temperature over the past five to ten centuries. Links between central MSEA and Indo-Pacific atmospheric and surface ocean properties over the past centuries will be evaluated using observational/reanalysis products and coupled climate model simulations because model resolution may not fully capture climate and ocean variability within individual monsoon seasons.<br/><br/>The Asian Monsoon impacts roughly two-thirds of the global population. Multi-model assessments of regional climate under anthropogenic warming predict changes to the Asian Monsoon that are expected to impact regional climate and ocean variability.  These multi-model assessments also predict a transition to a more El Nino-like state, which is expected to variably alter precipitation, temperature and ocean circulation patterns globally.  The present understanding of past changes in monsoon strength and precipitation and the resulting consequences for Indian Ocean surface variability limits climatologist?s ability to accurately forecast regional climate impacts at various timescales.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include better understanding of variability and long-term trends in rainfall and drought from Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.

That question is especially urgent since national and regional authorities are facing scientific uncertainty and fast-moving events that cross geopolitical borders, and the need for quick action stands in tension with the need to ground policy in robust expert knowledge and convincing analysis. Ways of identifying trustworthy sources of expertise is essential, but they remain largely vested in governments with their differing institutions, research traditions, cultural commitments, and civic beliefs. The PIs will conduct a multi-sited investigation in ten regions that will capture detailed information about the COVID 19 crisis as it unfolds, and then conduct a rigorous comparative analysis to provide a better understanding of the relationship between expertise and trust, a critically important nexus for policy makers in an era of decentralized information and polarized politics. Effective dissemination of results to critical policy analysts and policy communities is key to the success of this project. To achieve this goal, the PIs will utilize the extensive connections that they and their collaborative partners have to science policymakers and national and international organizations.<br/><br/>The PIs have assembled a team of research partners, well established STS scholars in ten regions, who have agreed to participate in the project. This team will collect and analyze publications and public documents pertaining to COVID-19 policy making in each region. These materials will provide the basis for STS-based accounts of knowledge and policymaking in each region for the comparisons that are central to this project. To provide that account, they will build a basic policy timeline tracking key events and decisions in each region?s response to the pandemic. Tracking these moves will enable them to document change and analyze variations in how issues are framed and evidence is gathered. They will also collect information on uncertainties (such as scope and limitations of scientific knowledge) and controversies, with a focus on the most contentious aspect of coronavirus policy in each region. In addition, they will track carefully chosen objects as they are incorporated into policy discussions.

Anthropogenic deforestation is frequently associated with increases in wildlife disease. These patterns are expected to stem from both landscape-scale processes, such as changes in animal movement and disease transmission, and fine-scale processes, such as changes in the community of microbes that inhabit animal tissues (collectively termed the microbiome), but the interplay between these multi-scale processes is unresolved. This project investigates the relationship between deforestation and the microbiome to explain patterns of disease emergence across a range of disturbed environments, using amphibians of Brazil?s Atlantic Forest as a model system. Work here stands apart from previous studies by integrating landscape-scale and microbe-scale processes into a unified framework that will advance microbial, disease, and global change ecology. This project implements a diversity recruitment program for graduate students with support from the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program at the University of Alabama and other funding sources at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. In partnership with the Alabama Museum of Natural History, portable mini exhibits and school activities w will be manufactured and implemented to narrow the K-12 science education gap in one of the most underserved areas in the nation. It is predicted that these exhibits will reach 66,000 students annually in five county school districts in Alabama.<br/><br/>The diverse assemblages of microbes that inhabit vertebrate hosts, collectively termed the microbiome, are vital to animal health. However, links between the host microbiome and emerging wildlife diseases are rarely considered within a landscape ecology framework. Repeated exposure to pathogens may alter community dynamics within the host microbiome and can promote competitive microbial interactions and host responses that may enrich the microbiome with anti-pathogen members. This form of acquired pathogen resistance, termed microbiome memory, may facilitate host recovery and prime the host after subsequent pathogen exposures. Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation notoriously restricts host movement at the landscape scale, which may alter rates of pathogen exposure that are critical for establishing microbiome memory prior to seasonal increases in pathogen pressure. This project will investigate interactive effects of anthropogenic habitat disturbance and host microbiome dynamics as a mechanism to explain observed increases in disease risk in fragmented landscapes, using amphibians of Brazil?s Atlantic Forest as a model system. The selection acting on amphibian skin microbiomes in a survey of three amphibian species with seasonal pathogen dynamics across a gradient of landscape fragmentation will be examined. Also, field experiments will be conducted using microbiome manipulation, host translocation, and radio telemetry to test for mechanisms linking habitat fragmentation, disease, and the host microbiome independently from other components of host immunity. This work will generate a robust dataset integrating landscape ecology with a metacommunity theory of adaptive microbiomes, with novel implications for host resistance to disease and the maintenance and stability of biological diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the short run, governments and health organizations provide extensive information and recommend behavior to avoid contracting the disease and spreading it to others. This research involves surveys to figure out whether and to what extent people follow recommendations and change behavior. Because the research team has been following a sample of university students for several years, the team already knows a lot about them, and this facilitates an understanding of variation in compliance with recommendations. For example, risk-tolerance and trust in organizations are likely to matter. The team is exploring how people process information about the virus, and how that affects their beliefs about the risks to themselves and others. The researchers also are examining the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on social norms, and how those change over time. The second wave of the study looks for longer run impacts. The results of this study will be useful in shaping future policies and communications about health risks, especially during epidemics and other health crises.<br/>  <br/>The researchers make use of previous samples of subjects to test the impact of COVID-19 information and recommendations on behavior, social norms, trust in each other and institutions, and risk-tolerance. They have four areas of study. The first is how how people process ?noisy? information in the context of COVID-19. Prior research by a team member has shown that some individuals tend to misunderstand such information to their benefit. The teams adapt the methodology and protocol of the prior work to examine how individuals interpret COVID-19 information, and how this affects their beliefs about their own vulnerabilities. Second, the team studies the impact of COVID-19 on norms of behavior, including those directly related to the virus (social distancing, hand-washing), as well as norms of trust, sharing and in-group favoritism that may be shifting or newly emerging in response to COVID19. Prior work by a team member developed a methodology for eliciting social norms, and has shown that norms evolve in response to social influence. Third, they explore the impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal trust and trust in institutions, which significantly impacts willingness to follow government and organizational recommendations. Prior work by team members used incentivized games and surveys to study trust and reciprocity in natural disaster settings. Finally, they look at risk perception and risk taking related to COVID-19. Using incentivized measures of risk tolerance, and survey measures of domain-specific risk perceptions and behavior, the team explores the relationship between risk aversion and behavior, but also how the advent of COVID-19 has changed preferences for risk-taking. In these ways prior knowledge about the subjects provides an opportunity to study the impact of a national health catastrophe on information processing, social norms, trust and reciprocity and risk-taking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two molecules that have the same composition and structure but are mirror images of each other can elicit drastically different biological responses. Consequently, synthetic methods that enable precise control of three-dimensional molecular structure are essential.  Metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are routinely employed by medicinal chemists in efforts to produce biologically active compounds. However, these reactions are most reliable for the preparation of flat molecular units, and not for the preparation of three-dimensionally branched molecular structures.  Professor Biscoe?s research investigates new strategies towards the preparation of individual mirror images of a branched molecule.  From these studies, new chemical reactions are developed that expedite the synthesis of chiral molecules and contribute to the improved safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical and other biologically-relevant compounds emerging from the discovery process.  Dr. Biscoe is  active in projects that are designed to increase the diversity of students participating in the STEM fields.  As part of these outreach activities, Dr. Biscoe is initiating a joint research program between CCNY and the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering (HSMSE) of City College. The goal of this program is to create a mechanism through which high school students can gain exposure to cutting-edge academic research, thereby facilitating a career path in scientific research. <br/><br/>With this NSF award, Professor Biscoe is investigating the transfer of stereodefined alkyl units in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. This research focuses on the use of enantioenriched alkylcarbastannatranes in cross-coupling reactions.  The factors that influence stereochemical transfer from the alkyl unit of the carbastannatrane backbone are explored in these studies.  As alkyl transfer can occur with retention or inversion of three-dimensional geometry, a variety of mechanistic probes are employed to elucidate the underlying chemical factors most influential in determining the pathway of alkyl transfer.  Because alkyl transfer to palladium is a fundamental step in the catalytic cycle of cross-coupling reactions, these studies facilitate the development of new stereospecific cross-coupling reactions, which can be used to generate non-racemic molecules enantio- or diastereoselectively.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nationally, there is low diversity among professionals in conservation and environmental science.  Increased diversity can support greater innovation in solving a range of environmental problems, many of which will have disproportionate impact on more diverse and often underserved communities.  The overarching goal of the project is to create an integrated program that will support inclusive excellence in environmental, conservation, and ecological sciences.  To support this aim, the project will implement inclusive mentoring, early and immersive exposure to field-based science and tools, and extensive professional skills development and career experiences. This project expects to increase involvement of students, particularly for Hispanic students, in environmental sciences and contribute knowledge about the importance of field and research experiences in fostering careers in environmental science. <br/> <br/>The specific aims of the project are to: 1) assist undergraduate students in making critical transitions in progressing towards an environmental sciences career; 2) engage undergraduate students in career and research opportunities in environmental sectors throughout their undergraduate career; 3) foster a sense of identity among students as environmental scientists; and 4) explore how these interventions affect career choice, sense of identity, and perception of the role of environmental science in serving their community. Specifically, this program intends to develop a sequence of research and professional development experiences relevant to conservation and environmental sciences that span all four years of undergraduate education.  These experiences will include an intensive research experience, a methods-focused field trip, a career internship, a service-learning experience, as well as mentoring and career exposure.  Evaluation components that focus on social and personal identity will be integrated throughout the project activities, so that the project can examine the impact of these efforts both in shaping a student?s sense of identity as a scientist and in improving retention in the STEM ecological sciences workforce. The project will test the hypothesis that early intensive interventions, extensive mentoring, and immersive experiences can overcome existing barriers to participation in environmental science.  The project will support the development of courses and a mentoring framework that will persist within the university after the end of the funding, facilitating long-term increased participation of students, particularly Hispanic students, in environmental science. The knowledge generated in this project may also be useful for successful implementation of similar intervention efforts at other locations.  The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Principal among these is the realization that opportunities for experiential learning during spring and summer 2020 ? including traditional, field-based geologic courses and camps used as capstone experiences for undergraduate majors ? must rapidly make an unprecedented shift to distance learning or be cancelled altogether. The need is urgent: these experiences are critical opportunities for students to apply what they have learned throughout their undergraduate career. With most field-based capstones scheduled to begin in early May, 2020, there is not enough time for instructors to gain the expertise needed to develop and implement suitable virtual alternatives. A much more effective approach for addressing this crisis is coordinating a collective action to share expertise and activities. This project is helping our community develop and organize this collective momentum through an integrated series of professional, curricular, and digital infrastructure development initiatives. The project team is: (1) building avenues for sharing expertise within the community to enhance capacity for designing and implementing virtual field experiences; (2) collectively outlining the desired learning outcomes and skills that are developed during capstone field experiences; (3) constructing and populating a new online collection of activities, resources, and materials designed to meet those learning outcomes; and (4) reviewing and disseminating the products of this community-wide effort as a foundation for an educationally robust, virtual field camp. Resources being developed through this project will be freely available to the geoscience community. Activities are being tied to the community-derived learning outcomes and integrate cutting-edge technologies to accelerate geoscience students? exposure to digital learning tools, resources, and strategies that are rising in the profession (e.g., GoogleEarth, StraboSpot, ArcGIS PRO, etc.). The outcomes of this project will also help address the long-standing challenge of building field experiences that promote inclusivity, accessibility, and equity for those who are commonly marginalized by traditional field learning methods and experiences. Indeed, this effort will foster the creation and expansion of curricular tools and opportunities that can help geoscience students overcome barriers to participation (e.g., physical disabilities, financial concerns, cultural stigmas, or family obligations), help to reduce the novelty space associated with traditional, field-based experiences, and ultimately allow students to build relevant skills and confidence before going to the field.<br/><br/>The proposed approach to facilitating a rapid transition to virtual alternatives for traditional field camp in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is to support groups of faculty in developing high-quality, peer-reviewed virtual/online activities that can be easily discovered in an online clearinghouse and integrated into an alternative capstone experience by any instructor. The first step in this process is to develop a community of expertise through a series of webinars involving field instructors. With help from the National Association of Geoscience Teachers, these webinars explore the challenges associated with the growing number of cancelled summer field courses, confirmed the urgency of the situation, and gauged interest in collaboratively developing new modules for virtual field instruction. The project team is coordinating with the National Association of Geoscience Teachers to establish web-based work spaces for nine working groups: (1) Learning objectives & assessment for field experiences; (2) Virtual class-related field trips; (3) Developing a community-based, virtual field camp; (4) Virtual hydrogeology/environmental field experiences; (5) Virtual geophysical field experiences; (6) Marine geology/sedimentology field experiences; (7) Working with virtual world technologies; (8) Digital tools for enhancing virtual field experiences; and (9) Non-field camp capstone experiences. The project team is hosting a one-day workshop based on the successful On the Cutting Edge (a cooperative professional development program run by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers and the Science Education Resource Center) Building Strong Geoscience Departments Program to distill a new set of community-derived list of learning outcomes using a backward design approach. These new learning outcomes satisfy both virtual and field-based capstone experiences and provide a basis for arguing the equivalency of these programs to graduate school programs, professional licensure boards, and potential employers, that students affected by pandemic-related program changes will encounter in the future. With these new learning outcomes in hand, working groups quickly develop new high-quality curricular materials for virtual capstone experiences to meet the needs of distance learning pedagogies put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new learning outcomes will then guide working groups in the compilation, development, and review of a new collection of online activities. The project team and working group leaders can engage a broad range of instructors through these working groups, match instructors with efforts to develop activities within their expertise, and collect feedback from potential users of the material. New activities will include the learning outcomes and skills they address and be uploaded to a searchable collection on the Teach the Earth website, the National Association of Geoscience Teachers' portal to Earth education resources that is hosted by the Science Education Resource Center. This website has well-established protocols for activity submission and the infrastructure needed to build searchable collections. Two levels of peer review using established rubrics will assess scientific accuracy; alignment of goals, activity, and assessment; pedagogical effectiveness; robustness (usability and dependability of all lesson components); and completeness of the web page for the activity to ensure successful implementation. Each activity will be connected to an overview page that introduces the learning objectives, associated pedagogical tips and strategies, and other resources as needed. These pages will help instructors to quickly select sets of activities that satisfy the learning outcomes of their particular capstone programs.<br/><br/><br/>Funds to support this project are provided by the EAR Tectonics Program and the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the rapid onset of the pandemic, BIO-REU principal investigators (PIs) were caught largely unprepared to deliver REU learning through distance technologies. This proposal will capitalize of the organizing activities started by BIO-REU PIs to provide distance REU programs. Specifically, PIs are making substantial changes to their programs to engage students in research at a distance, including shifting to research projects that can be conducted at a distance, offering research mentoring and professional development online, and providing informal avenues for communication at a distance. The shift to distance programming is both necessary and unprecedented. Substantive evaluation is needed in order to refine these approaches to maximize student learning and minimize disruption to REU offerings, which play a critical role in developing the research workforce. This project will improve student learning and development in distance BIO-REU sites by carrying out such an evaluation. First, the distance REUs will be evaluated early in their programming through virtual focus groups with students and mentors as well as observations of synchronous, distance activities. The results of these evaluations will be reported rapidly to the BIO-REU PIs to enable prompt adjustments and refinements of distance program activities. Then, additional focus group and survey data will be collected to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to (a) build a sense of community in their cohorts, (b) ensure student ownership of their research projects, (c) provide quality mentorship at a distance, and (d) influence students? professional growth and their education and career interests. Data will be compared across REU sites and with published studies of in-person REU sites to identify strategies useful for improving student learning in distance REUs. Results will be shared in reports to each REU site in order to make improvements and published for the undergraduate STEM education community to apply lessons learned in future undergraduate research programming. <br/><br/>This project will accomplish two major goals: (1) evaluating distance REUs in order to improve student learning and research workforce development and (2) producing new knowledge about the effectiveness of distance REU programming. Using established approaches and measurements for evaluating undergraduate research experiences, the project will involve conducting focus groups, observing program activities, and collecting survey data from undergraduate researchers and their research mentors at REU sites across the country that are operating at a distance due to COVID19. Results from analysis of focus groups and observations will be rapidly reported to REU site leaders to make immediate improvements to better support student learning. Results from surveys and focus groups will be used to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to achieve similar goals to in-person REUs, including building a sense of community, ensuring robust student involvement in research, providing quality mentorship at a distance, and influencing students? professional growth and their education and career interests. The project will produce tested strategies for engaging undergraduates in research at a distance, which could be applied to other circumstances such as serving students who are not able to travel to a distant REU site or engaging students following natural disasters.

Recent predictions suggest that without serious interventions, a large portion of the world population will become infected, resulting in millions of deaths. To mitigate this worst-case scenario, key policy decisions are being guided by mathematical models. However, several prominent models make unrealistic assumptions about human contacts i.e., that an individual is equally likely to infect a close family member as a complete stranger on the other side of the country. Such assumptions are useful for calculations, but fail to take into account the full geographic complexity of the outbreak. Furthermore, many models do not consider the consequences of the quarantine of healthy individuals. This project will use rigorous analysis and simulation to address these shortcomings by describing a more realistic structure of quarantined networks and how disease spreads in them. The proposed research will use real-world data about contact networks to make predictions and recommendations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, improving our understanding of how best to contain the current as well as future pandemics. The project will involve the training of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This research will describe the effect of quarantine on connectivity and disease transmission on more realistic networks than have previously been considered. Of particular importance will be locating critical thresholds which, when exceeded, allow large epidemics to occur. There is recent study of these thresholds, but for networks that model digital infrastructure and social networks. The first objective of the research will be to determine the effect of biased site percolation on graph structure, especially how different percolation rules influence the size of the largest component of a given graph. The second part will then focus on how the critical threshold and size of the epidemic for an SIR model change after percolation. This will be explored rigorously on graphs generated from the configuration model as well as random spatial networks such as Gilbert graphs. Additionally, these questions will be investigated on real world face-to-face networks using data specific to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Answering them will help test robustness of previous models, while also exploring the effectiveness of stronger preemptive distancing.<br/><br/>This grant is being awarded using funds made available by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act supplemental funds allocated to MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis will focus on skeletal trauma, disease, and fracture analysis which will be statistically examined through hierarchical log-linear analysis and binomial logistic regression. The project highlights the heterogeneous physiological impact of past mental institutionalization in their socio-cultural and historical contexts. It investigates whether skeletal health and epidemiological differences or trends exist across institutionalized geographical samples and attempts to determine if differences in trauma and disease patterns between African-American and Euro-American groups are present in order to gain insight into the impact of racism and segregation within the institutional setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In so doing, it contributes to pressing scientific, medical, ethical, and policy discussions about the goals and consequences of research regulations and scientific knowledge production. The project also elucidates how the production of knowledge about reproduction matters for health and health disparities. This project's education plan centers on expanding instruction in science and technology studies and ethics. It will offer students who will be going into applied research, clinical work, public sector positions, and academia productive training for critically assessing, managing, and studying key issues in population health and research ethics. The broader impacts of this project also include producing white papers, training graduate students, and convening an interdisciplinary workshop that advances academic and public dialogue about reproduction and research. This project will be of interest to biomedical researchers, obstetric patients and their families, educators in the biomedical field and medical policy makers.<br/><br/>Drawing on multiple methods, including archival research, content analysis, oral histories, ethnographic observations, and interviews with experts and multiple stakeholder groups, this project documents past and present changes in research regulations pertaining to obstetric patients, and it analyzes how stakeholders respond to regulatory revisions related to reproduction. It asks: What social, cultural, political, and ethical factors have influenced research regulations regarding obstetric patients over the past eight decades? How do changes in regulatory categories with respect to obstetric patients and clinical research get taken up, deployed, and implemented? How do stakeholders respond to cultural, ethical, and regulatory changes in the context of reproduction and biomedical research? In answering these questions, this project enhances basic understanding within the history and sociology of medical science, and advances theory in science and technology studies about processes of knowledge production and outcomes of regulatory change. This project also increases scholarly and public understandings of the ethics and morality of human subjects research and builds a theoretical framework for the social production of ethics at the intersection of science studies and bioethics. Organizing a national workshop enables this project to bridge science studies scholarship with wider conversations about reproduction and bioethics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, these early roots are in the form of problematic beliefs, including beliefs that science is something in which only a select group of people can succeed. These beliefs are particularly discouraging for children from social groups that are underrepresented in science, including girls and children from certain racial and ethnic minority groups. This project will reveal how these problematic beliefs develop and how to promote more beneficial ones?in particular, how to promote beliefs that science is something that people learn to do rather than an identity that one needs to have. Further, this project will test whether targeting these beliefs in early childhood creates positive trajectories of science engagement over children?s transition from prekindergarten into formal schooling. In doing so, this project will develop a new approach to spreading beneficial beliefs about science and promoting science engagement among young children from social groups that are underrepresented in science, while addressing fundamental questions about how beliefs develop and spread across communities. By partnering with teachers to implement this project and using an innovative, webcam-based lab for remote developmental research, this project will maximize the opportunities for this research to lead to rapid changes in educational practices that will broaden participation in science in early childhood. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which emphasizes STEM education research that will generate foundational knowledge in the field.<br/><br/>Phase 1 will reveal the mechanisms by which problematic or beneficial beliefs about science arise in early childhood via an experimental field study with 2,000 children and 200 teachers in a large, public prekindergarten program. This field experiment will test a model of conceptual development and belief transmission wherein children?s beliefs are shaped by subtle features of the language they hear about science; in particular, teachers? use of linguistic cues implying that scientists are a special kind of person, including category labels (e.g., ?Let?s be scientists!?) and generic descriptions of what scientists do or are like (e.g., ?Scientists discover things about the world?). The field experiment will test the influence of reducing these identity-focused linguistic cues, and instead encourage more action-oriented language (e.g., ?Let?s do science! Doing science leads to discovering things about the world?) on the development of children?s science beliefs and behavior. Phase 2 will examine the extent to which children?s developing beliefs about whether success in science requires a special identity have consequences for the development of social stereotypes about science and for children?s science engagement and efficacy over the transition to kindergarten (as social disparities in science interest and social stereotypes about scientists begin to emerge). This phase will entail a two-year longitudinal follow-up study of a subset of 500 children from the field experiment, which will be conducted via an innovative webcam-based lab for remote developmental research, which will allow for longitudinal tracking after children transition schools. Thus, this project will advance research by addressing fundamental questions about the nature of early conceptual and social development, including how language shapes the development of children?s science beliefs and behavior, how children?s beliefs change over time, and how researchers and educators can harness developmental mechanisms to promote positive developmental trajectories of science engagement across diverse populations of children. Creation of a public website to share project materials and findings will enable rapid dissemination to researchers across disciplines, curriculum developers, prekindergarten teachers, and families of young children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting the speed and severity of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and allocating medical resources appropriately is central to dealing with epidemics. Epidemics like COVID-19 not only affect world-wide health, but also have profound economic and social impact. Containing the epidemic, providing informed predictions and preventing future epidemics is essential for the global population to resume their day-to-day work and travel without fear. Shortage of resources puts undue stress on healthcare system further risking health of the community. Preparedness and better management of available resources would require specific predictions at the level of cities and counties around the world rather than solely at the level of countries. The project will provide a predictive understanding of the spread of the virus by developing machine learning based computational models to study the transmission of the virus and evaluate the impact of various interventions on disease spread. The project will learn infection prediction models for COVID-19 considering the following. (i) Predicting at state/county/city-level rather than country-level as finer granularity is essential in planning and managing resources. (ii) How infectious a person is changes over time. Learning the model through observed data will help in understanding of the temporal nature of the virality. (iii) At such granularity travel is a significant reason for the spread and needs to be accounted for. (iv) Available data needs to be ?corrected? by finding the number of underlying unreported cases that are not observed and yet influence the epidemic dynamics. The project will also solve the resource allocation problem based on the prediction ? for instance if a certain number of masks will be available next week in a certain state, how should they be distributed across different hospitals in the state (which hospitals and how many in each state)?<br/><br/>Proposed project ReCOVER will use a novel fine-grained, heterogeneous infection rate model to perform predictions at various granularities (hospital/airports, city, state, country) while accounting for human mobility. ReCOVER will integrate data from various sources to build highly accurate models for prediction of the epidemic across the world at various granularity. Due to the ability to capture temporal heterogeneity in infection rate, the approach has the potential to provide insights into infectious nature of COVID-19 which are not fully understood yet. The project will address the issue of unreported cases through temporal analysis of historical infections and correct the data. The right granularities of modeling will be automatically identified, e.g., when to model a state over its cities to trade-off precision for higher reliability in predictions. The proposed project also formulates and solves a resource allocation problem that can guide the response to contain the epidemic and prevent future outbreaks. This is provided by optimal solutions to resource allocation over a network where each node (representing a region) has a function that captures probabilistic response. While the project obtains data with COVID-19 in consideration, the model and algorithms developed under the project are applicable to a wide class of contagious diseases. The project will culminate into an interactive customizable tool that can be used to perform predictions and resource management by a qualified user such as a government entity tasked with managing the epidemic response. The data and code will also be shared with research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Protein kinases are enzymes that play a central role during these processes by transducing external and internal signals to downstream cellular components resulting in the modulation of plant growth accordingly. Thus, the accurate detection of kinase activity is critical for understanding the mechanism governing the plant?s response to various signals, which may lead to the development of new crops with better stress resilience and productivity. The goal of this proposed study is to develop a new assay that facilitates the detection of kinase activity in plants. This project not only provides a novel approach to detect kinase activity in a facile manner but also enables the researcher to overview dynamic cellular changes in response to various stresses and growth conditions. The project will also provide research training to graduate and undergraduate students who will acquire interdisciplinary techniques integrating molecular biology and chemical analysis. <br/><br/>Protein kinases modulate the phosphorylation status of cellular targets, thereby regulating plant growth, immunity, and stress responses. Dysregulation of kinase activity often leads to severe defects in the overall fitness of plants and stress responses. Because of its critical roles in plants, kinase activity can be used to deduce the status of signal transduction and the plant?s stress response. In this respect, kinase activity assays with high sensitivity, specificity, cost-efficiency, ease of use, or multiplexing capability are critical prerequisites for researchers to accurately measure in vivo and in vitro kinase activity. However, most current kinase assays still lack at least some desired capabilities. Emerging DNA-based activity measurements of enzymes in drug discovery research have shown promise in addressing the unmet need for optimal kinase assays in the field, providing a kinase toolbox with the desired aspects. The goal of this proposal is to develop a kinase assay, taking advantage of the strength of DNA-based enzyme activity measurement, and to validate the assay for in vivo plant kinome studies by using the plant hormone ethylene and brassinosteroid signaling as a model system. The proposed kinase assay uses DNA-encoded peptide substrates as activity probes and qPCR-based quantification of kinase activity. Given the versatility of qPCR in detecting extremely low concentrations of DNA with high specificity through unique DNA sequence-mediated barcoding for substrate peptides, the investigators hypothesize that the proposed DNA-encoded kinase assay should be able to overcome the limitations of current kinase assays and become a valuable tool in plant signal transduction research. Furthermore, by using the multiplexing capability of the assay and next-generation DNA sequencing, they will develop DNA-encoded peptide arrays that provide a simultaneous quantitative dynamic overview of the changes in cellular phosphorylation events in plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ethylene glycol is primarily used in the production of plastics for textiles and food packaging. Chlorine is a major industrial chemical used in water purification and fabrication of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fabrication. This proposed electrochemical process utilizes waste carbon dioxide and renewable electricity, resulting in net carbon-negative emissions, unlike petrochemical sourcing. Combining ethylene glycol and the co-production of chlorine will make the overall process cost-competitive with production from fossil feedstocks, while supporting environmental sustainability. This platform technology holds promise for an extension to other parts of the chemical industry. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to address the sustainable co-production of three major chemicals by one unitized device: Chlorine (Cl2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and ethylene glycol from renewable electricity, brine, and carbon dioxide. Current carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) suffers from three major constraints: 1) high electricity costs, 2) low relative price of bulk chemicals, and 3) low energy efficiency of CO2 reduction. This project will address these constraints by using recently developed energy efficient CO2RR to ethylene glycol catalysts and co-producing Cl2 and NaOH to offset the electricity cost and low ethylene glycol price. Three technical barriers that result from combing Cl2, NaOH, and CO2RR will be addressed: A) Producing Cl2 and NaOH, which requires strict product separation (leading to less valuable hypochlorite and impure NaOH); B) Maintaining three different pH conditions in the cell (acidic for chlorine, basic for alkali, and neutral for CO2RR); and C) Providing fundamental insights into the membrane, electrode, and electrolyzer designs for complex multiproduct processes. These will be addressed by combined experiments and modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core part of this project is to tackle these questions with cutting-edge modern methods coming from the homological mirror symmetry program. Homological mirror symmetry is a deep geometric duality that originates in quantum field theory and has been used in studying novel phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic geometry suggested by algebraic geometry. This project aims to use homological mirror symmetry to introduce new applications of symplectic topology to algebraic geometry and to answer classical open questions in birational geometry. A postdoctoral fellow will be involved in various aspects of this research project.<br/><br/>This project will use an approach based on categorical Kähler geometry. The most notable application of this approach is toward proving the non-rationality of generic, four-dimensional cubics, which is arguably the central problem in algebraic geometry. More specifically, a detailed study of the singularities of quantum D-modules produces a completely new type of birational invariant. This new invariant is a canonical decomposition of the cohomology of a four-dimensional cubic based on simultaneous use of both (algebraic and symplectic) sides of homological mirror symmetry. The example of four-dimensional cubics is only the tip of the iceberg.

While testing is the primary source to collect such information, the lack of testing resources and the resultant under-testing significantly hampers this effort. Mobile crowdsensing is an alternative technological approach that can be effective in such situations if used by a significant fraction of the population. However, privacy concerns as well as the stigma associated with the pandemic prove to be huge barriers that inhibit the accurate collection of information in this way. The goal of this project is to develop an infrastructure and platform to collect data from the population and distill it into aggregate information to provide insight to both users and policymakers while protecting privacy. The project also aims to gain a broader understanding of privacy and decision making in extreme situations and learn how humans value their privacy and the choices they make in such situations. The project will enable the collection of real-time data, which is not available otherwise, and will enable a more effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased dissemination of localized information to users can help encourage social distancing from a psychological perspective and thus contribute to the well-being of individuals in society.

The jet is a key component of the climate of South America as it brings moisture from the tropical Atlantic to inland regions of the continent.  It also contributes to the formation of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and the extreme weather they produce.  In many ways the SALLJ is analogous to the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ) that flows northward along the eastern side of the Rockies and brings moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to the breadbasket of the plains.  But research on the GPLLJ dates back to at least the 1950s while the SALLJ was not extensively documented until the 1980s.  Also, most of the research on the SALLJ is focused on the central Andes, from southern Peru to Paraguay (on the east side), and the extension of the SALLJ into Columbia and Venezuela was not documented until 2010. The distinction between the central and northern Andes is significant, as the two regions differ in their climate, large-scale circulation regimes, and connections to climate modes like El Nino.<br/><br/>Here the Principal Investigators (PIs) conduct a comprehensive examination of the SALLJ, including both the northern and central Andes.  Preliminary work by the PIs shows a strong difference in seasonality between the SALLJ between two regions, with relatively muted seasonality in the central Andes but a distinct summer minimum in the north.  This difference prompts the PIs to hypothesize that different mechanisms could be involved in the northern Andes, where factors such as the strength and position of the North Atlantic Subtropical High could be relevant. A further issue is the impact of variability in the northern branch on the central branch.  These issues are explored through examination of meteorological data and numerical simulations using two climate models (CESM2 and ECHAM6).<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the impact of SALLJ variability on water resources and extreme weather over inland South America.  The PIs work with partners at the Brazilian National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters to develop tools for monitoring and forecasting SALLJ activity and extreme precipitation.  The PIs also conduct local outreach through seminars on climate variability, climate change, and their socioeconomic impacts, presented during their department's Geography Awareness week. The project supports a PhD student and a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing support and training to the next generation of researchers in this area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By collecting video of city sidewalks and public spaces, we can understand how people are interpreting and responding to social distance orders, and, later, we can show how these behaviors affect health outcomes neighborhood by neighborhood. As the coronavirus spreads to other locales, evidence about how specific behaviors correlate with disease spread will encourage public compliance. For example, it is believed that it is safe to exercise outdoors, as long as people are not running too close with one another. Running and hiking are permitted; however, using parks to play pickup games of basketball is not. The data collected in this project will aid in establishing clearer, evidence-backed guidance for what safe and dangerous activities might be. The data will be also useful in future human robot interaction research. It will help autonomous systems, such as autonomous cars, delivery robots, and emergency service vehicles, to automatically recognize what people are doing, so that they can respond appropriately. This can be applied to a variety of purposes: It can help emergency response teams to quickly locate people that need help. It can help cars and robots to better understand different kinds of human activities, so that they might wait for momentary situations to pass, or steer around activities that will be longer in duration. <br/><br/>This project  will gather data on outdoor pedestrian and light vehicle (bicycle, scooter, skateboard) activity in New York from a) dashcam footage from vehicles driving through the city, b) video streams gathered from public web cameras, and c) mobile phone geo-location data volunteered by local citizens, to form a map of urban mobility and space occupancy under social distancing policy. This data will enable researchers to infer the activities, contexts, origins and destinations of the people in public spaces. This information can reveal where and, in turn, why stay at home orders are and are not being followed. It can also help to identify areas where essential services or activities are not distributed or designed optimally to decrease unnecessary interaction. This data can also be used in post-hoc analysis of policy directives and infection patterns, so as to better inform policy and social distancing design. It advances our understanding of how public policy translates to behaviors and activities on the ground, and how the emergence of individual behaviors and social interactions influence social health outcomes. This work demonstrates the application of current-day computer recognition and mobile technology to capture human behavior, will improve and validate models for infectious disease prevention, and also will inform public policy. In addition, it will augment the robotic community's ability to recognize human activities in urban spaces. By modelling social distancing behaviors, we can better design socially appropriate human robot interaction for public urban spaces in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the outbreak, state and local governments have enacted policies and guidelines (i.e., nonpharmaceutical interventions) to stem the spread of the disease, including a statewide shelter-in-place order. This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will conduct longitudinal (repeat) street view surveys for 12 months across a broad cross-section of Seattle to collect data on the community impact of the pandemic. The survey campaign will produce a high-resolution, ground-based record of the urban region both during and after this pandemic. The data set will provide fundamental insights on (1) disaster impacts on business operations, transportation networks, and other community assets, (2) the rate and quality of recovery following shelter-in-place, and how this varies locally based on a community's socioeconomic characteristics, and (3) the impact of shelter-in-place policy relaxation on communities following this disaster. In addition to the data collection, this project will advance the scientific application of post-event mobile imaging by establishing sampling protocols that may be used to guide data collection campaigns for future disruptive events. All project data will be made openly available to research and practice communities in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Date Depot (https://www.Designsafe-ci.org).  <br/><br/>The street view surveys will be conducted using the NSF-supported NHERI RAPID facility's vehicle-mounted mobile imaging system, located at the University of Washington. Two data collection strategies will be adopted: (1) canvassing, an umbrella approach to acquire data that may be used to answer diverse multidisciplinary research questions, and (2) surveying across community capitals transects (social, cultural, built, economic, and public health), an approach grounded in capital-based resilience theory to promote the capacity for replication across a wide range of communities and hazards. The project will also develop and implement a series of open-source routines that automatically process the data to rapidly extract time-sensitive insights from the imagery. The processed data set will serve as a benchmark for calibrating and validating urban simulation and recovery models and many of the emerging artificial intelligence-based models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award is made by the AISL program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.   The major public policy of social distancing relies, in part, on the cooperation of younger and healthier people who may not experience symptoms and can spread the virus unknowingly to more vulnerable populations. Science journalists, who are on the front lines of covering the pandemic, can play an important role in educating millennial audiences about the science behind the virus, how it is transmitted and effective ways to prevent the virus from spreading.  This award will help the STEM field better understand how to engage millennial audiences with effective COVID-19 media content and to urgently capture professional knowledge on crisis reporting.  KQED and Texas Tech University are suited to rapidly implement a science media informal science learning project targeting millennials and younger audiences in light of their current NSF-funded ""Cracking the Code: Influencing Millennial Science Engagement"" collaborative research and evaluation project (DRL 1810990 and 1811091). The project team has built a functional research protocol for its media practitioner and academic researcher collaboration, and  will apply these new RAPID funds to complement on-going efforts, mobilize the existing team, research protocol, and  research tools to respond to the communication challenge of reaching younger adults posed by COVID-19.  Content to be created includes:  1) Radio broadcasts - daily news coverage, live talks; 2) A real-time blog - live Coronavirus updates and 3) Social media content on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.<br/><br/>The project team will explore the following research questions:<br/>1) How could COVID-19 coverage be designed to best inform, engage and educate millennials and younger audiences about the science of virus transmission and prevention?<br/>2) What are some best practices for crisis reporting, as journalists respond to both constantly updated information and changing audience needs, that can be used by media outlets (such as advisors PBS Digital Studios, PBS NewsHour, NOVA, NPR Science, and more)?  <br/><br/>The research protocol centers around ""media testing cycles,"" which are time-bounded studies (5 months long) exploring a subset of research questions about the effectiveness of KQED's science content (articles, videos, social media posts and radio reporting) at reaching younger audiences. Steps include identifying problems that are suited for empirical examination; formulating plausible competing hypotheses on the nature of those problems and their potential solutions; and crafting study designs calculated to support valid, realistic inferences on the relative strength of those hypotheses. Data will be gathered from COVID-19 audience ""chatter"" from Twitter and Facebook through Crimson Hexagon, a social media listening platform. In addition to the social media listening, researchers will conduct a thematic analysis of the questions currently being collected through the audience engagement platform Hearken, where KQED has gathered nearly 2,000 questions to date about the virus and lifestyle changes. This data will also help the project team understand knowledge gaps about prevention and transmission of the virus. These two qualitative studies will be conducted concurrently and reported to KQED journalists quickly to inform reporting.<br/><br/>Texas Tech researchers will create a virus transmission and prevention knowledge assessment. This assessment will be validated using a national online survey. The project will examine knowledge differences based on, for example, generation and gender. TTU will examine relationships between performance on this assessment and two relevant measures: science curiosity and ordinary science intelligence. The national survey will help identify what knowledge gaps are present in which audiences. Using this information, KQED journalists will develop ""explainers"" and other news content, to meet audience needs and to fill knowledge gaps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

COVID-19 diagnostic tests currently implement a technique called reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This technique requires two reagent kits. The first is used to extract the genetic material, ribonucleic acid (RNA), from the coronavirus, and the second is used to amplify the RNA to enable its detection with RT-PCR. The current diagnostic crisis is due, in part, to shortages of the RNA extraction kits and the time required to extract the RNA using the kits. Increasing both the availability and time-efficiency of these kits is vital to improve testing accessibility and enhance the reliability of clinical diagnostics. In this project, a novel process for producing porous sorbent materials will be used to develop an alternative extraction kit for efficient and rapid extraction of nucleic acids from patient samples. The performance will be further optimized by studying the molecular mechanisms governing nucleic acid capture and release by the sorbents and applying this fundamental knowledge. The development and clinical validation of a novel extraction kit will be followed by mass production, addressing the current shortage and improving access to COVID-19 testing. The close collaboration between engineers developing the diagnostic technologies and clinicians implementing the prototypes, as enabled by this project, will streamline the transition of scientific knowledge into solutions that benefit the health and well-being of society. The project will also provide workforce development opportunities through training researchers in novel diagnostic techniques for coronaviruses.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a novel, scalable approach to nucleic acid separation and concentration and mass-produce prototype kits for immediate implementation in clinical settings. The concept relies on the use of sorbent materials instead of the current filter- and silica column-based approach. Unlike filters that use pore size to physically separate the target (here nucleic acids) from the media, sorbents are a porous material that captures the target by chemical affinity and interactions. As a result, the use of a sorbent enables larger water flow rates, enhanced nucleic acid capture efficiency, and faster sample processing, and overcomes the need for multiple buffers or extraction steps. Functionalization of conventional filters with a combination of metal oxide nanoparticles and organosiloxane polymers will be used to produce the nucleic acid sorbent. The functionalization will be achieved by a new method for supported synthesis of nanoparticles by thermolysis and polymer conjugation. The efficiency of the sorbent will be assessed by the extraction and detection of nucleic acid using quantitative RT-PCR. Validation of the alternative sorbent kit will assess the effectiveness of the rapid separation and concentration of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. The project will also explore the fundamentals of nucleic acid dynamics in porous sorbents as it relates to nucleic acid size, sorbent chemistry, porosity and pore size, and the effect of transport phenomena in porous media. Enhanced understanding of the factors that affect the retention, release, and transport of nucleic acids in porous media is critical to producing reliable and efficient nucleic acid extraction and detection kits and the development of other bio-separation processes. Training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students will focus on how the combination of transdisciplinary collaboration and a clear understanding of the fundamental aspects can lead to disruptive technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not much is known about how Antarctica?s ice sheets might respond to ongoing and future warming, but such knowledge is important because Antarctica?s ice sheets might raise global sea levels significantly with continued melting. Over time, mud accumulates on the sea floor around Antarctica that is composed of the skeletons and debris of microscopic marine organisms and sediment from the adjacent continent. As this mud is deposited, it creates a record of past environmental and ecological changes, including ocean depth, glacier advance and retreat, ocean temperature, ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, ocean chemistry, and continental weathering. Scientists interested in understanding how Antarctica?s glaciers and ice sheets might respond to ongoing warming can use a variety of physical, biological, and chemical analyses of these mud archives to determine how long ago the mud was deposited and how the ice sheets, oceans, and marine ecosystems responded during intervals in the past when Earth?s climate was warmer. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida, University of Massachusetts, and Northern Illinois University will reconstruct the depth, ocean temperature, weathering and nutrient input, and marine ecosystems in the central Ross Sea from ~17 to 13 million years ago, when the warm Miocene Climate Optimum transitioned to a cooler interval with more extensive ice sheets. Record will be generated from new sediments recovered during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374 and legacy sequences recovered in the 1970?s during the Deep Sea Drilling Program. Results will be integrated into ice sheet and climate models to improve the accuracy of predictions. The research provides experience for three graduate students and seven undergraduate students via a multi-institutional REU program focused on increasing diversity in Antarctic Earth Sciences. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Deep-sea sediments reveal that the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) was the warmest climate interval of the last ~20 Ma, was associated with global carbon cycle changes and ice growth, and immediately preceded the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; ~14 Ma), one of three major intervals of Antarctic ice expansion and global cooling. Ice-proximal studies are required to assess: where and when ice grew, ice sheet extent, continental shelf geometry, high-latitude heat and moisture supply, oceanic and/or atmospheric temperature influence on ice dynamics, regional sea ice extent, meltwater input, and regions of bottom water formation. Existing studies indicate that ice expanded beyond the Transantarctic Mountains and onto the prograding Ross Sea continental shelf multiple times between ~17 and 13.5 Ma. However, these records are either too ice-proximal/terrestrial to adequately assess ocean-ice interactions or under-studied. To address this data gap, this work will: 1) generate micropaleontologic and geochemical records of oceanic and atmospheric temperature, water depth, ocean circulation, and paleoproductivity from existing Ross Sea marine sedimentary sequences, and 2) use these proxy records to test the hypothesis that dynamic glacial expansion in the Ross Sea sector during the MCO was driven by heat and moisture transport to the high latitudes during an interval of enhanced climate sensitivity. Downcore geochemical and micropaleontologic studies will focus on an expanded (120 m/my) early to middle Miocene (~17-16 Ma) diatom-bearing/rich mudstone/diatomite unit from IODP Site U1521, drilled on the Ross Sea continental shelf. A hiatus (~16-14.6 Ma) suggests ice expansion during the MCO, followed by diamictite to mudstone unit indicative of slight retreat (14.6 -14 Ma) immediately preceding the MMCT. Data from Site U1521 will be integrated with foraminiferal geochemical and micropaleontologic data from DSDP Leg 28 (1972/73) and RISP J-9 (1978-79) to develop a MCO to late Miocene regional view of ocean-ice sheet interactions using legacy core material previously processed for foraminifera. This integrated record will: 1) document the timing and extent of glacial advances and retreats across the prograding Ross Sea shelf during the middle and late Miocene, 2) provide orbital-scale paleotemperature reconstructions (TEX86, Mg/Ca, ?18O, MBT/CBT) to establish atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions during an extreme high-latitude warm interval, and 3) provide orbital-scale nutrient/paleoproductivity, ocean circulation, and paleoenvironmental data required to assess climate feedbacks associated with Miocene Antarctic ice sheet and global climate system development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(HRI). Science teachers serve a critically important public health function and become an important part of the nation?s response efforts. Given the magnitude of the current COVID-19 crisis, it is likely that students are bringing their questions and concerns to their science teachers. As this award is made, nearly all K?12 school buildings in the U.S. are closed, and science teachers face unprecedented challenges in carrying out the instruction for which they are responsible while simultaneously addressing students? questions about COVID-19. Moreover, they must do this within new instructional formats. Education is crucial for helping students to understand the facts about the virus, despite much conflicting information and misinformation available. Education helps students understand and actively participate in measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. This award will support a national research study on how teachers are helping students respond to COVID-19. The findings will inform the development of curriculum materials for teaching about COVID-19, which are much needed right now, and help science teachers to adapt their instruction as they help to fulfill a critical public health function. This study will enable a better understanding of the role that science teachers can play in a national response, both now and in future crises. <br/><br/>The research will build on a study of science teachers conducted by HRI following the Ebola outbreak of 2014.  Specifically, the research will investigate (1) where teachers of science get their information about coronavirus and COVID-19; (2) what types of resources teachers find most useful; (3) what factors influence whether science teachers address COVID-19 in their instruction; and (4) how science teachers adapt their teaching in response to COVID-19.  HRI will recruit a nationally representative sample of several thousand K?12 teachers of science and invite them to complete a survey about their instruction related to COVID-19, both before school buildings closed and after. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, the survey will be constructed to identify factors that predict whether teachers take up the topic.  The survey will also collect data about how teachers address the virus and its transmission with their students.  HRI will disaggregate survey data by school-, class-, student-, and teacher-level variables to identify patterns in student opportunities.  Survey data will be supplemented by interviews with 50 survey respondents to gather more in-depth information related to the constructs of interest. Study findings will be immediately shared through a preliminary report that focuses on the survey data; mainstream print media using press releases; and social media partnering with the National Science Teaching Association. HRI also will publish policy briefs intended as guidance for schools, districts, and states; and research articles.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the DRK-12 program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

This project will study the ability of nonhuman primate species to monitor, or introspect about, their thinking. The ability to monitor and control thinking is referred to as ?cognitive control? and is shown when humans pay attention, remember, and inhibit unwanted behavior. This research will help us know what makes human thinking unique, and will provide better animal models to use to understand and develop treatments for human brain diseases. This project will train scientists from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level. The research group will participate in public education about primate cognition at Zoo Atlanta, and science outreach activities in public schools. Specifically this work will, 1) improve an undergraduate research course using the Zoo Atlanta collection, 2) prepare graduate students (14% of current students are underrepresented groups) for careers in science through training in research program development, grant writing, and scientific communication, 3) share enthusiasm for science through visits to schools during Brain Awareness Week, through programs such as Roots & Shoots, and by interaction with the public at Zoo Atlanta, 4) train students through Emory research experience programs, which involve students from underrepresented groups, 5) share information through expansion of an existing lab website, aimed at the public interested in cognitive science as well as undergraduates interested in primate research.<br/><br/>Cognitive control is critical for complex cognition in humans, and differences in cognitive control may underlie many differences in cognitive ability between humans and other primates, including in directing perception to needed information, active maintenance of information in memory, and inhibition of inappropriate behavior. In humans, cognitive control is associated with explicit cognition, in that explicit cognition, such as episodic memory, is accessible to metacognitive monitoring whereas implicit cognition, such as priming and habits, is not so accessible. Metacognition is the capacity to monitor one?s own ongoing cognitive processes, and to exert cognitive control over them, for example by actively holding information in working memory or ceasing to study new vocabulary words as they are mastered. Evidence from both psychophysical and memory tests indicates that some cercopithecoids introspectively monitor some cognitive processes, demonstrated by selective avoidance of difficult tests. The PI will extend this work and advance knowledge of the evolution of complex cognition and of what makes humans unique with comparative studies of primates. The proposed research is significant because it will identify the role of cognitive monitoring and control in complex primate cognition, and begin to investigate how the evolution of language has changed human memory. The work will advance our understanding of the evolution of metacognition and cognitive control. First, the proposed work will identify the extent to which cognitive systems differ in their access to metacognitive monitoring. This will include comparing different memory systems as well as the auditory versus visual sensory modalities. Second, these studies will determine the kinds of information metacognitive systems operate upon to exert cognitive control, for example abstract codes in working memory. Third, the work will advance our understanding of cognitive evolution and differences in memory between cercopithecoid and hominoid primates, leveraging our exciting recent findings comparing memory in these taxa.

This coincides with a critical social change as students are urged to leave campus, ?social distance,? and shelter-in-place; practices that will disrupt social network functioning and could lead to feelings of isolation, reduced motivation, and poorer learning outcomes. Worse, the social and academic consequences could be more severe for less academically prepared students (e.g., underrepresented minorities, first-generation college, low socioeconomic status) and first year students in particular, who are still adjusting to college life (e.g., building social networks, learning university culture). Given the uncertainty of the current situation, it is critical to understand how the pandemic and the ""social distance"" triggered by it may influence student social networks and whether disparities in social and academic outcomes result.  This RAPID was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This award is made by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program in the Division of Research on Learning, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. <br/><br/>The goal of this RAPID research project is to investigate how the shift to remote learning triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting social networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes for first-year STEM majors, and whether disparities emerge for students from subgroups historically more likely to leave STEM. The research will examine these potential impacts, and how risks might be offset by an existing intervention at the University of California Irvine (UCI) -- the Enhanced Academic Success Experience (EASE) program. EASE is a learning community designed to improve academic outcomes for under-prepared students, with one-third of the approximately 1,000 first-year majors in the School of Biological Sciences (Bio Sci) participating each year. To date, research on the intervention has provided strong causal evidence that EASE has successfully increased motivation, engagement, and belongingness, with stronger effects for groups typically underrepresented within STEM. As part of the intervention, researchers have gathered longitudinal network data that are unique in both scale (~1,000 students/year within a major) and coverage (85-96% response rate). This research will characterize changes in friendship and study networks, psycho-social adjustment, and academic outcomes that result from the unprecedented shift to remote organizational activities. The new data collection and analysis will explore whether the shift to remote learning creates disparities in these important outcomes for subgroups of STEM students and whether the learning community provided by EASE may mitigate these effects. Through supplementary data collection, the study will consider how student networks have adapted to the organizational shift to remote learning and where students are obtaining the kinds of emotional and instrumental support they need. Mediation analysis will offer insight into which network characteristics explain psycho-social and academic consequences of the shift to remote learning. More generally, the unique data will enable assessment of how social networks adapt to societal-level disruption caused by the pandemic, and how well-implemented institutional support may offset the anticipated risks associated with the pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Implementation of these policies varies across the U.S. and globally due to local circumstances. A common consequence is a huge shift in Internet use, with university dormitories and high schools emptying and home use increasing. The goal of this project is to observe this shift, globally, through changes in Internet address usage, allowing observation of early reactions to COVID and, one hopes, a future shift back.<br/><br/>This project plans to develop two complementary methods of assessing Internet use by measuring address activity and how it changes relative to historical trends. The project will directly measure Internet address use globally based on continuous, ongoing measurements of more than 4 million IPv4 networks. The project will also directly measure Internet address use in network traffic at a regional Internet exchange point where multiple Internet providers interconnect. The first approach provides a global picture, while the second provides a more detailed but regional picture; together they will help evaluate measurement accuracy.<br/><br/>This project allows to capture an improved global picture of how different parts of the world react to COVID-19, as seen through their use of the Internet. In particular, the results from this research will help understand changing behavior of networks compared to  historical data, and provide a new method based on address usage to characterize how people are staying home, and to look for the effectiveness and onset of work-from-home and shelter-in-place.<br/><br/>The project website will be at https://ant.isi.edu/minceq.

Links between central MSEA and Indo-Pacific atmospheric and surface ocean properties over the past centuries will be evaluated using observational/reanalysis products and coupled climate model simulations because model resolution may not fully capture climate and ocean variability within individual monsoon seasons.<br/><br/>The Asian Monsoon impacts roughly two-thirds of the global population. Multi-model assessments of regional climate under anthropogenic warming predict changes to the Asian Monsoon that are expected to impact regional climate and ocean variability.  These multi-model assessments also predict a transition to a more El Nino-like state, which is expected to variably alter precipitation, temperature and ocean circulation patterns globally.  The present understanding of past changes in monsoon strength and precipitation and the resulting consequences for Indian Ocean surface variability limits climatologist?s ability to accurately forecast regional climate impacts at various timescales.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include better understanding of variability and long-term trends in rainfall and drought from Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.

The experiments are applied to agricultural input markets.  This research project will take advantage of the entry of a large quality conscious agro-input store chain into the agro-input market of a country to examine whether entry by this quality-conscious chain can improve outcomes in this market, especially price, quality, and usage of fertilizer.   The researchers will also study how farmers change their views on quality and buying habits as they learn about the differential quality and prices of the new market entrant as well as the reaction of existing forms to these market changes.  The results of this research project will not only offer an empirical test of the effects of competitive pressures on product quality, price, and consumer welfare, it also shows one mechanisms through which agricultural productivity can be increased, especially in low income countries.  This will increase the productivity and incomes of farmers, thus decreasing poverty.  <br/><br/>This research project will use lab-in-the field experiments to measure the broader impacts of entry on the market with particular refence on quality, price and changes in preferences. The PIs hypothesize that the effects will take place through the new firms increasing  competitive pressures on existing retailers and/or by shifting consumer beliefs.  Modern seeds and fertilizers have the potential to boost agricultural yields, but there is a high prevalence of low-quality inputs on the market in low income communities.  This can reduce farmers? propensity to use modern inputs which in turn lowers agricultural productivity and economic growth.   This research project proposes a two-pronged research design to study the effects of new market entrant. First, the new entrant is willing to randomize where the new stores will open across a set of pre-identified locations. This will allow the PIs to measure how competition affects prices, quality, and firm entry/exit. Second, experiments with farmers who live near study markets will measure their willingness to pay for inputs of differing provenance and quality levels. These experiments will shed light on the mechanisms behind market-level effects. By studying whether market forces can increase the product quality available to consumers, the findings could have large implications for economic growth in the region and for the welfare of millions of farmers.  The results of this research will inform policies to increase the adoption of modern agricultural inputs, hence improve productivity and incomes, leading to poverty reduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With increasing access to sequencing technologies, scientists can analyze the genome sequences of collected SARS-CoV-2 viral samples in order to gain information about to aid in the development of vaccines and drugs as well as to infer the most likely evolutionary history of the virus, which can help epidemiologists track the spread of the virus across populations. The epidemiological use of the evolutionary history of the virus is only useful if it can be updated in real-time, but as the sheer volume of available data rapidly grows, scientists will require scalable computational tools to conduct these analyses. The goal of this project is to develop novel algorithms, software tools, and hardware systems that will scale to the massive amounts of data that are rapidly being generated in this pandemic, which will in turn aid in phylogenomic analysis of the virus, the effective tracking of the spread of the virus as well as in the development of novel vaccines and drugs in this pandemic. As a broader impact, this project will help with replicability and reproducibility of genetic and epidemiological research results. Furthermore, the existence of such a system will aid in fighting future viral outbreaks. This project provides professional development opportunities for an early career scientist.<br/><br/>The standard viral phylogenetic inference workflow consists of quality checking and filtering, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic inference, phylogenetic rooting, phylogenetic dating, and transmission clustering. The researchers have identified that the computational bottlenecks of the workflow are multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference, which scale poorly as a function of the number of input sequences. The objective of this project is the development of a user-friendly, scalable, and modular workflow for conducting a real-time computational phylogenetic analysis of assembled viral genomes, with a primary focus of SARS-CoV-2. The project solution includes: (1) the development of a novel software tool for orchestrating the automated end-to-end workflow, (2) the development of novel algorithms (and software implementations of these algorithms) to speed up the computational bottlenecks of the workflow, (3) the development of novel hardware systems for accelerating the workflow, and (4) a real-time publicly-accessible repository in which researchers can access the most up-to-date analysis results (with intermediate files) of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes currently available to prevent repeat computation efforts.

In this project, the research team aims to develop an alternative diagnostic approach that directly detects the viral RNA without any amplification, labeling, or the use of enzymes.  The assay requires minimal steps and uses a compact, bufferless gel cartridge system that can be deployed in a clinical setting.

Once the viral RNA is extracted from a sample, the RNA is fragmented and mixed with the DNA-based nanoswitches.  Hybridization of a viral RNA fragment of a specific sequence with a nanoswitch induces a conformational change of the engineered DNA strand from its linear ""off"" state to a looped ""on"" state.  After separation of the target-bound looped form from the linear nanoswitches by electrophoresis in a gel cartridge system, the viral load is quantified from the intensity of the looped (on) nanoswitches in a gel image.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three aims will be pursued: 1) identify and quantify the design attributes and operation strategies that may impact pathogen dynamics; 2) audit the types, abundance, and co-occurrence patterns, as well as spatiotemporal dynamics of microorganisms, particularly pathogens, associated with spatially and functionally distributed system components; and 3) characterize the impacts of design and operation on the transmission and exposure pathways of microorganisms in infrastructure systems. The spatial and functional interdependence of system components will be considered to parameterize design attributes based on building information modeling and syntactic analysis. The operation strategies will be modeled using integrated data sensing and simulation techniques. A model-informed sampling approach will be developed with molecular and metagenomics techniques to characterize spatiotemporal microbiome dynamics. The impacts of design and operation on microbial transmission and exposure pathways will be assessed using integrated source tracking and machine learning methods. At the nexus of infrastructure system engineering and environmental microbiology, this convergence research will provide unique insights into design attributes and operation practices impacting pathogen transmission and exposure in mass-gathering civil infrastructure systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a microbe in a hostile environment activates mechanisms of defense. However, it is not well understood how bacteria are able to differentiate between the many chemical stimuli that they encounter and respond accordingly. Professors Carlson and Goodpaster of the University of Minnesota uses chemical synthesis and biochemical methods to gain an understanding of the response pathways that bacteria use and how their responses are customized to a variety of environmental conditions, such as high temperature, low nutrients, or the presence of chemical compounds, such as antibiotics. This knowledge ultimately enables us to control the behaviors of bacteria to our advantage, including for the production of biofuels or natural products that can be used as drugs. A collection of educational activities introduces students, especially girls from low socioeconomic groups and diverse backgrounds, to the roles that microbes play in our lives. These efforts include interactions with the same cohort of girls and young women over multiple years, encouraging them to see themselves as scientists in their future careers. This program also provides opportunities for graduate students to mentor and teach students starting from age six and generates materials that are broadly disseminated to enable others to teach young students about bacteria and their many functions on our lives, both bad and good. <br/><br/><br/>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is funding Professors Carlson and Goodpaster at the University of Minnesota to study how microbes translate the complex environment in which they live into the actions required to survive and thrive. Essential to this capability are the two-component system (TCSs), which consist of a histidine kinase and response regulator protein pair. A single organism possesses tens to hundreds of individual TCSs, each reacting with high sensitivity and selectivity to one or a small number of chemical signals. Each chemical message is converted into a defined bacterial action, ranging from growth, motility, biosynthesis of natural products, and pathogenesis. Although numerous individual TCSs have been studied, current methodologies do not enable global assessment of the conditions under which many of them are induced, characterization of the relationship between TCS signal transduction and phenotypic results, or the regulation of response between multiple TCSs. A deeper understanding of TCS-mediated signaling is achieved by: 1) Synthesis and evaluation of molecules to develop an understanding of how to internalize phosphate-containing molecules into bacteria, and 2) Develop chemical proteomics methodologies to pair TCSs with their stimulating molecule(s) and to globally map HK activation by environmental stressors in live cells. The overarching goal is to define the suite of TCSs that are required for a generic stress response and those that are stimulus-specific. This information promotes a deeper understanding of how bacteria are able to utilize their relatively limited genome to orchestrate response to nearly limitless stimuli. This goal is aligned with one of the NSF 10 Big Ideas, Understanding the Rules of Life.  A set of rules that predict an organism's observable characteristics and its phenotype, as it relates to the roles of the TCSs, is elucidated.  These research goals are complemented with educational and outreach activities, focused on girls from low socioeconomic groups and diverse backgrounds, that introduce them to the roles that microbes play in our everyday lives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During regular conversation, small virus-laden droplets are generated in the respiratory and vocal tract. They are then expelled into the surrounding environment as airflow exits the mouth. Larger droplets may impact surfaces in the immediate vicinity, while smaller ones may stay suspended in the air as aerosols for long periods of time. Both types of expiratory droplets pose an infection risk. Larger droplets may land directly on individuals that are in close proximity, while smaller aerosolized particles are capable of traveling longer distances and infecting people much farther away by being inhaled into the respiratory tract. Currently, the range of distances that particles travel when produced by speech, and the resulting infection risk posed to individuals in the immediate (near field) and more distant (far field) vicinity, is not well understood. The potential for increased infection risk due to prolonged speech in indoor environments, where airborne particles may accumulate over time and reach higher concentrations, is also not known. This research proposal aims to answer these questions by performing physical measurements of speech in tandem with numerical modeling of droplet transport to predict infection risks in both the near and far field of an infected speaker.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to determine how virus-laden droplets are spread during speech. Particular emphasis is placed on investigating specific vocal intonations that produce high velocity bursts of air at the mouth (i.e., fricatives and plosives), which are hypothesized to propel particles over relatively long distances and increase infection risk in both the near and far field. Experimental velocity field measurements of the human mouth jet will be acquired using particle image velocimetry for sustained vowels, fricatives, and plosives, at varying levels of loudness. Separately, aerodynamic particle size spectrometry will measure the droplet size distributions generated by these same utterances. These data will be used to validate and inform an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics model that adopts an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to model and quantify droplet dynamics. Coupling the expiratory velocity fields and particle dynamics for specific speech utterances will facilitate predicting the infection risk arising from voiced speech by using viral titer levels and infectious doses for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Near and far field infection risks will be quantified for both open and confined surroundings, where the competing times scales associated with ventilation, particle settling, and virus inactivation rates, will influence the steady-state particle accumulation. Mitigation strategies to decrease infection risk in indoor environments will also be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are no known effective therapeutics to combat the coronavirus (COVID19) disease and the vaccines in development face manufacturing challenges for scale and stability. This research brings an advanced nanomanufacturing approach to vaccine development by coupling expertise in polymer fabrication with biomedical engineering. The plant virus offers a unique biomaterial for vaccine discovery because it can be easily engineered to mimic coronavirus without being infectious and it is highly stable under various environmental conditions. The innovation in this technology is that these vaccine candidates can be manufactured using established polymer-processing technologies, such as injection molding, into self-administered vaccine patches for durable protective response. These scalable processing technologies can impact vaccine distribution on a massive scale, since they can be used to fabricate vaccine/polymer patches rapidly at low cost. The research is multi-disciplinary and involves polymer science, bioengineering, and plant molecular farming. Students conducting this research are trained in an interdisciplinary environment, putting them at the forefront of innovation to help position the nation as a technological leader. The PIs are committed to education and outreach through engaging underrepresented high school student in research and through dissemination of results via public lectures and demonstrations.<br/><br/>Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is used as a nanotechnology scaffold to present epitopes (antigenic peptides) of the novel coronavirus to generate vaccine candidates. The nanoscale virus-like particle is highly visible to the immune system and serves as an epitope presentation technology and adjuvant (to boost the immune response). This research develops vaccine cocktails to provide the most protective shield against the virus. CPMV is especially suited for advanced manufacturing technologies. CPMV is produced through molecular farming in plants. The plant virus-based vaccine candidates are stable under the polymer processing temperature conditions required for delivery device manufacturing. The plug-and-play technology can be quickly changed as public health needs evolve. For example, if mutants or novel strains emerge the platform is adaptable in that the epitopes can be easily replaced. The CPMV vaccine candidates are blended into slowly degradable polymers and injection molded into microneedle patches. Injection molding is a scalable method to manufacture polymeric devices at low cost. The polymers are chosen for slow release of the vaccine candidate over the course of months, providing protection over the course of the pandemic. The slow release of the vaccine provides boosts to the immune system, which is effective after a single administration. Once realized, these patches can be shipped outside of the cold-chain and show efficacy when self-applied.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to make it possible for wearables to feature such capabilities. Being aware of brain states is not only extremely valuable in clinical studies but is also crucial to improving human performance in various everyday life activities. While recording neural signals directly from the scalp region is possible, it is impractical for use in everyday life. In order to fill this gap, the goal of this project is to pioneer a closed-loop brain-aware wearable architecture called MINDWATCH. This enables (1) decoding multidimensional brain states from noninvasive wearable devices and (2) applying corrective control. MINDWATCH will transform healthcare delivery (e.g., aging, autism, dementia) as well as human performance and productivity enhancement (e.g., online learning, smart workplaces).  For instance, knowledge of mental health and cognitive engagement can enable detecting if a student is depressed or is not cognitively engaged/learning, which makes it possible to take corrective action early on. The research is integrated with educational and outreach activities with an emphasis on increasing the participation of minorities in science and engineering. These activities include hosting hands-on STEM K12 events, supervising undergraduate research interns and capstone senior design projects, creating educational videos, and interdisciplinary course development.<br/><br/>This project seeks to overcome the barriers to achieving brain-aware wearables by pioneering a transformative system-theoretic computational toolset for noninvasive closed-loop wearable architectures that monitor and modulate brain function without needing neural recordings. The proposed framework will (1) infer discrete brain-related events in real-world settings, (2) decode multidimensional latent neurobehavioral states based on inferred brain activity, and (3) apply robust adaptive control to maintain the neurobehavioral states within desired ranges. The closed-loop framework will be rigorously validated using experiments on interactive human-technology environments and mental health. The proposed research will provide foundational statistical signal processing and control-theoretic tools for the analysis of multimodal binary and continuous physiological observations that occur on multiple time-scales. While the initial focus is on two aspects of brain function, namely mental health and cognitive engagement, the proposed framework opens up the opportunity to investigate broader questions in computational neuroscience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to a threat such as COVID-19, their mission requires the communication of accurate and credible information to local populations using a variety of media channels. Increasingly, social media is a critical component of their communication toolbox - but using it to rapidly and effectively inform the public in a crowded media environment remains a significant challenge.  In prior work on online communication associated with the Zika and Ebola outbreaks, the PIs established that effective messaging depended upon employing a combination of content, style, and structure features - but that the right mix seemed to depend upon properties of the disease event (including the uncertainty and ambiguity of the threat, the nature of the consequences involved, and the need for public information).  COVID-19 poses a distinct risk profile, with a disruption potential to the American public and the built environment not seen by any threat within decades.  This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will identify the key drivers of effective messaging in an emerging pandemic, and strategies for improving effectiveness in social media communication involving COVID-19 by public agencies.  The specific focus will be on the outcomes of message retransmission (essential for both high levels of message penetration and ensuring multiple exposures critical for behavioral influence) and engagement (a critical indicator of attention and a driver of trust), both of which are measurable and established as core outcomes in prior studies of effective social media communication.  By establishing evidence-based guidance for agencies to effectively warn, inform, and engage the general public during an emerging pandemic, this project will provide critical guidance needed to mount effective interventions that save lives, reduce economic losses, and protect the security of the nation against health threats, in alignment with the broader mission of the NSF.<br/><br/>This objective will be pursued through the following core activities: (1) collection of perishable social media data on COVID-19 messaging by public agencies, and public engagement with/retransmission of those messages; (2) content coding of COVID-19 messages, to typologize information that is specific to the present event; (3) characterization of messaging strategies used by public agencies in the evolving COVID-19 response; (4) predictive analysis of message outcomes based on message context, content, style, and structure; and (5) development of evidence-based guidance for effective social media messaging by public agencies in response to this and similar events.  This research strategy builds on successful prior work in response to emergent infectious disease threats and in the context of anthropogenic and natural hazard events.  The intellectual merit of the research includes: Risk communication messages on social media are real time traces of online in/formal communication shared under conditions of imminent and ongoing threat; Research on communication and messaging dynamics online provides insights into the social amplification of risk, via diffusion of information; and strategies to design effective messages. This project will test the risk communication on social media model in response to a global pandemic by analyzing official communication from state, local, and national public health and emergency management Twitter accounts.  The findings from this work will lead to the further development and refinement of the social amplification of risk framework and the risk communication on social media model.   The broader impacts of this work most prominently include the accumulation of an evidence base for social media messaging, as noted above.  This research will have immediate benefits to organizations and agencies tasked with communicating to at risk populations about emergent infectious disease in the context of the built environment. Our findings will inform the design and dissemination of risk communication messages and will be immediately applicable to public health and safety organizations in the context of COVID-19. Results will be shared via fact sheets, webinars, published papers, and presentations with academic and practitioner audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A modeling study suggests that over a thousand cubic kilometers of fresh water could be trapped offshore New England, and hundreds of thousands of cubic kilometers exist within passive continental margins globally. For reference, the City of New York consumes roughly a cubic kilometer per year. Under recent NSF support, a towed electromagnetic (CSEM) system was designed, constructed, and tested that is aimed at surveying offshore groundwater. This technique builds on experience in the petroleum industry using a similar technology. CSEM is preferentially sensitive to resistive bodies, which include fresh water. During the course of an 8-day test cruise in August 2019, more than 700 km of data were collected over a region extending from the east end of Martha?s Vineyard to offshore Long Island and from coastal waters to the edge of the continental shelf. This proposal seeks to analyze, model, and interpret this exciting data set. Specifically, the inference that the entire New England shelf is underlain by freshwater is a hypothesis that can be partially tested. The result will contribute to national health and welfare, and has societal relevance given the increasing scarcity of fresh water. <br/><br/>The towed streamer CSEM system is composed of a 1-km long receive streamer towed at half of the water depth, and a 250-m long transmit dipole towed near the surface. The transmit streamer is powered by a 250-A source producing a bespoke waveform between 0.1-10 Hz. Data are available in real time via optical fibers in the streamer cable. Data are collected in ?shots?, each 60 s, of transmitted waveforms and 10 s with the transmitter off to measure noise levels. The work to be carried out under this proposal includes: 1) merging the navigation and streamer attitude data to produce a model for receiver location as a function of time, 2) computing the frequency response of each shot, removing the source response in the process, 3) devising a robust method for culling out the shots that are noisy to produce a final data set, 4) merging the navigation and shot data to produce a final data set containing location, depth, amplitude and phase, and 5) inverting the data to produce 2D resistivity maps along the various lines where data were collected.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To study these questions, the project plans to take a multi-faceted approach, exploring issues including access performance and interconnect capacity when using critical applications when the network is under strain. <br/><br/>This measurement study will shed light on the extent to which the existing Internet infrastructure can sustain exogenous shocks that dramatically shift the location, nature, and scale of network traffic and help identify vulnerabilities. Insights into the state of broadband Internet performance will yield important insights about how broader government policies to close schools and rely on remote e-learning may affect the broader population. Understanding the increased strain on the Internet on other application areas in medicine and public health, including patient compliance and remote caregiving, may lead to improved design of the Internet for such application areas.

However, existing network throughput measurement (speed test) platforms are often not representative of the performance of cloud-based applications due to the location of test servers. Measuring the performance of interconnections between cloud platforms and Internet Service Providers (cloud-ISP links) is a critical missing piece to understanding user-experienced performance of cloud-based videoconferencing applications.<br/><br/>This project will design and deploy novel experiments to measure network congestion of cloud-ISP links, tracking evolution of performance degradations during mandatory sheltering-in-place orders, and as large segments of the U.S. work force transition back to their workplaces.  This scientific measurement project will tackle three challenges: 1) strategic selection of test servers within residential access and transit ISPs, based on topology measurements and analytics, 2) scientific characterization of the algorithms and behavior of speed tests, and 3) correct interpretation measurement results. The experiments will leverage speed test servers deployed by various commercial platforms (e.g., Ookla) as vantage points to conduct throughput measurements from cloud platforms hosting high-bandwidth applications. Operationalizing this experiment will provide longitudinal data to analyze performance degradation of cloud-ISP interconnections.<br/><br/>This research will enable studying the performance and reliability of critical Internet infrastructures in the U.S. during this pandemic, by collecting and sharing data that sheds light on the quality of experience of cloud-based telework applications. Visualized data will be generated to provide longitudinal views of network performance, and identify performance degradations at fine granularity, geographically and topologically.

In addition to the growing numbers of cases and deaths, the social, economic, and political impacts are vast. Lacking a vaccine or effective therapeutic cure, the front line of defense against the spread of this disease depends on human behavior, following guidelines about social distancing, sanitation, and other recommended measures. There is great uncertainty about the future trajectory of the disease and its impacts. Against the backdrop of this catastrophic threat this research forecasts public perceptions of risks, including hopes and fears, using a new theoretical model based on what is known as ?the affect heuristic.? The researchers build and test this model in two ways that increase understanding of how positive and negative emotions, influenced by daily news reports, interact to guide behavior. Understanding the changing reactions to news information not only advances understanding of risk perception, but enables the creation of effective risk communication messages. The research provides insight into the behaviors that will determine the course of the disease and can help to mitigate its harmful social and economic impacts.<br/><br/>Studies have consistently found an inverse relationship between judgments of benefits and risks associated with a wide array of hazards. This relationship occurs because perceptions of risk and benefit are derived in opposite ways from an affective sense of the importance of the risk. This process became known as the affect heuristic. The causal dynamics that underlie the relationship between affect and perceived risks and benefits remain poorly understood. This project does three things: (1a) constructs a system dynamics simulation model that explicitly incorporates the informational feedback loops that allow affect to play this moderating role and (1b) simulates the trajectories of affect and perceived risk and benefits as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds, (2) constructs a hybrid agent-based model that incorporates findings from the systems model but allows for heterogeneity (e.g., different levels of medical vulnerability) among agents, and (3) conducts a longitudinal national panel to survey the public?s response to the pandemic over a 6 month period. These data together with data from an independent panel are be used to estimate and validate both models. This project has broad impacts because understanding how we manage our perceptions of risk and benefits is critical to the decisions we make and our behaviors. The project helps to explain this entanglement and predict public reaction to the current pandemic and, potentially, to other crises.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Influenza infection results in up to 700,000 hospitalizations and 56,000 deaths each year in the US.  Extreme lung inflammation due to an excessive immune response is a major factor of severe disease outcomes in influenza virus and coronavirus infection (including SARS, MERS, and in emerging evidence, the COVID-19 virus.)  The immune system is a complex, interactive, dynamic system that must optimally clear the virus infection while minimizing collateral damage to the lungs and other organs initiated by immune-regulated processes. Engineering-based mathematical modeling approaches are ideally suited to create computational simulations of the immune system that can be used to estimate the system?s response to virus infection. The overall goal of this research project is to construct realistic, predictive, physiologically accurate computational models of the natural immune response during influenza virus infection. The computational models will form the foundation for simulation-based research to identify the immunologic conditions that allow for excessive immune responses to occur. Simulations will also identify the best way to suppress immune activity, using chemical inhibition to reduce tissue inflammation while ensuring rapid clearance of the infection. As excessive inflammation is a common feature of many respiratory virus infections, the insights on immune regulation generated are expected to impact a variety of respiratory virus diseases. In parallel with this research effort, the research team will develop virtual reality (VR) games to better engage the public on matters associated with respiratory infection and immune responses. The VR games will be distributed to user smartphones for free to ensure strong public engagement. The VR games will also be used during workshops at local high schools to promote student engagement in engineering and immunology. <br/><br/>The Investigator?s long-term CAREER vision is to engineer computational modeling-based solutions to regulate and improve immune system responses. Toward this vision, the objectives of this CAREER project are to identify the molecular/cellular mechanisms that drive lung inflammation during influenza infection and to evaluate immunomodulatory treatment in silico using multiscale computational modeling. Studies show that selectively inhibiting the immune system can significantly improve infection outcomes by reducing inflammation without compromising virus clearance.  Immunomodulation has also been shown to offer greater protection than administration of antiviral medicines (e.g. oseltamivir), but no comprehensive guidelines for administering immunomodulatory treatments, such as anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, exist. Such immunomodulatory strategies are inherently an engineering optimization challenge: modifying immune responses to limit inflammation while ensuring virus clearance.  The predictive models designed can be used to evaluate specific hypotheses on the mechanisms regulating inflammation during influenza virus infection. The research program is organized under three synergistic objectives.  The FIRST Objective is to construct and use an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations) model to identify the molecular drivers of inflammation in influenza-infected human lung epithelial cells.  A model of epithelial intracellular signaling will be developed and used to uncover the molecular drivers of inflammatory protein production, evaluate trade-offs between inflammation and suppressing virus replication, and to identify possible virus-specific inflammatory regulation when comparing highly pathogenic (H5N1) and milder virus infections. Completion of this objective will provide evidence of the molecular mechanisms regulating lung epithelial inflammation in general and in specific virus infections. The SECOND Objective is to construct and use an ODE model to identify the immunologic conditions that drive enhanced inflammation in influenza-infected mouse lungs. The model will link lung epithelial signaling with immune cell infiltration. The model will be used to identify the mechanisms that drive enhanced inflammation at the tissue level and explore treatment options. Comparisons between infection with different viruses and between male (less severe) vs female (more severe) infection may reveal virus and cohort-specific inflammation regulation.  Completion of this objective will identify the key molecular and cellular drivers of influenza-induced inflammation, provide a novel computational model of the lung immune system that enables comparisons between important infection cohorts, and potentially identify virus-specific or sex-specific immune regulation that is driving differential inflammation. The THIRD Objective is to construct and use an ABM (Agent Based Model) of the lung immune system to quantify the impact of cell heterogeneity on tissue-level inflammation. Interferon production is stochastic and may factor into variable infection outcomes. Using customized code, an ABM in which ODEs define how agents (epithelial cells) interact with their environment will be constructed and used to interrogate how epithelial cellular heterogeneity impacts tissue-level inflammation during influenza infection. Completion of this objective will identify the components of the immune system responsible for maintaining a tightly regulated inflammatory response, provide knowledge of how intra-subject inflammation may vary due to differences in immune regulation, produce new code for the simulation community, and produce a novel ABM of the lung immune system during influenza infection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The sea ice cover that protects the ocean surface from storm winds in winter is thinned by summer melt, allowing the winds to push the ice apart and mix up warmer subsurface water that promotes further melting.  The lack of ice cover in summer also allows the winds to drive ocean waves which erode coastlines, where the warming of recent decades has thawed permafrost and removed the protective skirt of landfast ice.  Fortunately summer Arctic cyclones are weaker than their winter counterparts, but recent work suggests a strengthening trend in summer.  The ""Great Arctic Cyclone"" of August 2012 was stronger than all but a dozen of the winter cyclones in the 30 year record of pan-Arctic observations from weather satellites.<br/><br/>The impacts of Arctic cyclones and their connection to sea ice decline has prompted interest in their structure, dynamics, and cloud microphysics. Naturally they have much in common with the more familiar cyclones of the middle latitudes, but there are interesting differences: they are often larger, sometimes covering most of the Arctic basin, they are not closely connected to regions of strong temperature contrast and fast jet streams, they can continue to intensify even after they occlude, and their clouds are unusually abundant in liquid droplets (as opposed to ice particles).  The abundance of liquid water in the clouds increases the downwelling infrared radiation they generate, warming the lower atmosphere and promoting sea ice melt.<br/><br/>Work under this award uses a combination of satellite observations and meteorological data (including winds, sea level pressure, moisture, and temperature) to investigate summer Arctic cyclones at various stages in their lifecycles.  The cloud radar and lidar instruments on the NASA A-Train satellite constellation provide cross sections through the cyclones, and data for specific stages of cyclone lifecycles are identified according to their sea level pressure.  The observational analysis is complemented by computer simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model.  One question addressed is whether there are clues in the large-scale environment that could be used to determine which cyclones will grow to extreme size and intensity.<br/><br/>The project has broader impacts due to the strong impacts of summer cyclones on Arctic sea ice and coastal erosion, as noted above.  The project also supports two graduate students and employs undergraduate students on an hourly basis, thereby promoting the education of the next generation of researchers in this area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The IEEE FG conferences are the premier international forum for research in image- and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition.  Their broad scope includes new algorithms for computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics, as well as machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture and body motion for a variety of applications.  The conferences present research that advances the state of the art in these and related areas, leading to new capabilities in interactive systems, biometrics, surveillance, healthcare, and entertainment, and they play an important role in shaping related scientific, academic, and educational programs.  The Doctoral Consortium will provide an opportunity for Ph.D. students whose dissertations are on topics related to automatic face and gesture recognition to present their proposed research, and receive constructive feedback from an invited committee of faculty and industry researchers, as well as from other students working in these areas.  The event will give students valuable exposure to outside perspectives of their work, and provide a comfortable forum in which to discuss and fine-tune their career objectives with members of the international research community, and identify areas that need further development. The workshop will also enable these young researchers to develop a network of contacts at a critical stage of their careers, and will foster a supportive community of scholars and spirit of collaborative research, which will have broad impact because graduate students who are conducting creative and groundbreaking work are the foundation and future of the community.  The organizers will make a particular effort to recruit and include students from underrepresented groups (women and underrepresented minorities) and students from smaller schools or schools with less established computer vision research.  They will also try to recruit a demographically diverse (in terms of region, type of employment and stage in career) group of mentors to advise these students.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium will be a half-day event during the conference.  This year, there will be four distinct aspects to the event.  First, each participant will be paired up with an invited faculty or industrial researcher who works in the related area and will act as their mentor both in the Doctoral Consortium and throughout the FG conference.  Second, there will be a career panel during a working lunch where participants will have an opportunity to discuss their research and career objectives with other participants and mentors in an informal setting.  Third, there will be a dedicated oral session for the students to present their research to the invited committee.  Fourth, there will be a poster session for the students to present their work to all conference attendees.

Research Partnerships (PFI-TT) project is the higher energy density batteries that will result from our carbon aerogel technology.  With every new device and application powered by a lithium ion battery, consumers expect increased performance (capacity and cycle life) at lower cost.  To satisfy these demands, batteries of higher energy density than current state-of-the-art are needed. The proposed lightweight aerogels enable higher energy density batteries by replacing the heavier metal foils used in today?s battery electrodes. This increase in energy density is expected to allow customers to choose between either (1) a higher energy output for a given battery size/weight, or (2) a smaller battery size/weight without sacrificing the energy output achieved in current battery cells. With the global lithium ion battery market projected to rapidly grow from $21.4 B in 2018 to $45.6 B in 2021, the proposed technology provides a transformative strategy to battery manufacturers to increase the performance of devices powered by lithium ion batteries.<br/><br/>The proposed project involves constructing energy-dense battery electrodes that are smaller and lighter than current state-of-the-art. In conventional lithium ion batteries, the energy density is restricted by the weight of the metal-foil current collectors used to support the electrode films. As a solution to this limitation, the proposed project will advance the development of a porous, ultralight-weight carbon aerogel to replace the standard metal foils. Successful demonstration of the proposed technology will rely on completing the following goals: (i) developing a batch production method for scaling up aerogel production, (ii) optimizing the pore structure, electrical properties, and mechanical durability of the aerogel substrates, (iii) scaling up the fabrication procedure to produce composite aerogel electrodes, (iv) designing and fabricating large-format cells with the constructed aerogel electrodes, and (v) identifying the optimal cell chemistry for high performance aerogel pouch cells.  Successful solution of these issues would provide a strategy to construct lighter, smaller, and more energy-dense lithium ion batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Correlating these local factors with the number of infections and the availability of hospital resources can provide precious scientific and data-driven guidance to local policy makers. Different from existing, classic epidemic models, in this project we aim to build novel forecasting models based on cutting-edge AI techniques. The goal is to provide timely, localized information needed by administrators for strategic allocation of resources and planning towards reopening business.  One key advantage of our approach is that it is able to combine the data from regions with more COVID-19 cases with the US Census microdata that characterize each local community, hence helping us to make fine-grained predictions of the localized effects of a policy decision.<br/><br/>Existing simulation models for COVID-19 cases forecasting either ignore the fine-grained demographical, social and cultural difference at local communities, or often require complicated, manual parameter setting for estimating the effect of interventions. Existing statistical models, on the other hand, require substantial amount of data to be available, hence are not able to obtain sufficiently confident predictions on each local level. We propose a fundamentally different approach that is built on the newest neural network models like Transformers to overcome these weaknesses.  The proposed approach performs domain adaption and few shot learning, so that knowledge learned from other regions can be adapted to local communities even when only a few data points are available. Specifically, our approach will creatively draw information from the US Census?s American Community Survey data, COVID-19 related data from other regions at home and abroad, as well as other related kinds of epidemics under the clinical guidance of our collaborators from the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical models of evolution allow researchers to infer critical epidemiological parameters, such as the transmission rate, from the information encoded in phylogenetic trees. Because future predictions and policy decisions depend on these estimates, it is crucial that their accuracy and limitations are well understood. Recent findings suggest that many commonly used mathematical models of disease evolution may yield highly inaccurate parameter estimates and may severely underestimate the associated uncertainty, thus potentially leading to sub-optimal policy decisions that are either ineffective or needlessly disruptive. This project will clarify precisely what epidemiological insights can be reliably inferred from phylogenetic trees and will develop new approaches to robustly characterize the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19. Further, the project will determine which environmental, biological and policy factors affect the spread of COVID-19 based on phylogenetic data. The computational methods developed will be shared as standalone open source R packages that can be used for analyzing and guiding decisions against ongoing and future epidemics.<br/><br/>This project will use mathematical and computational methods to examine how and to what extent transmission, recovery and detection rates as well as the basic reproduction ratio (R0) and pathogen prevalence could possibly be estimated from phylogenetic data. The project will focus on models commonly used in phylogenetic epidemiology, including birth-death-sampling models and coalescent models with variable rates through time. The project will investigate whether the likelihood function of these models can be brought into special forms that reveal which epidemiological scenarios can possibly be statistically distinguished, similarly to the researchers' recent work on macroevolutionary birth-death models. Further, the researchers will develop more robust measures to characterize pathogen population dynamics over space and time from phylogenetic data, than currently possible. To that end, they will simulate a large number of epidemiological models and search for quantities that are preserved across statistically indistinguishable scenarios. The researchers will focus on the SARS-CoV-2 clade (the virus causing COVID-19) and will examine the implications of their findings for COVID-19 spread dynamics, based on published genomic data. In particular, they will perform comparative analyses between SARS-CoV-2 sub-clades as well as over space and time, to determine how various environmental, biological and policy factors affect the spread of the virus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such cyber-physical systems, which include many vital infrastructures that sustain modern society (e.g., transportation systems, electric power distribution) are usually safety-critical. If compromised, serious harm to the controlled physical entities and the people operating or utilizing them as well as significant economic losses can result. However, model mismatches between the real system and an imperfect model of the system, in addition to other sources of uncertainties (e.g., measurement errors) disable existing safety and security protection, while robust solutions without learning may be overly conservative. These challenges demonstrate the need to design novel computational tools that can guarantee robust safety and security of cyber-physical systems under real-world uncertainties without sacrificing performance. The project includes research activities that are integrated with education and outreach to engage students and industry partners to appreciate the importance of safety and security for computing-related technologies.<br/><br/>To enable learning-aided robust safety and security for cyber-physical systems, this project will develop mathematical foundations and control synthesis algorithms based on set-membership and learning approaches for uncertainty quantification, secure/attack-resilient estimation and safe-by-design control.

One of the oldest supercontinents for which significant geologic constraints exist is Columbia (also referred to as Nuna), which is thought to have been assembled by about 1.5 billion years ago.  Sediments deposited between ~1.5 and 1.4 billion years ago in western North America include minerals that lack known North American sources and thus suggest that another continent was adjacent to western North America within Columbia.  However, the identity of this continent and the extent to which any rearrangement occurred between ~1.5 billion years ago and the formation of the next supercontinent (called Rodinia) at ~1.0 billion years ago remains debated.  Models have been proposed that place either northern Australia, southern Australia, and/or eastern Antarctica adjacent to western North America.  This research will test these different models through detailed analyses of the ages and compositions of minerals within ancient sedimentary rocks in Montana, Idaho, and Arizona and comparison with potential sources in Australia and Antarctica.  Further constraints will be provided from comparable analyses of minerals in ancient sedimentary rocks collected from Antarctica.  This project will support graduate and undergraduate student research at the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML), the development of a new summer field geology and ecology course for UML students held in and around Glacier National Park (which is a key locality for the rocks of interest in this project), incorporation of supported research into other undergraduate courses at UML, and collaborations with scientists in Idaho, Arizona, Washington, Texas, and Minnesota.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to test models for the identity and positions of continental blocks that were connected to western North America in the Mesoproterozoic supercontinent Columbia.  The study will focus on the provenance of Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in western North America, particularly the Belt Supergroup in Montana/Idaho and similarly aged rocks in Arizona.  These sedimentary sequences have previously been recognized as having non-North American input via conventional detrital zircon dating.  This work will use an innovative and integrative approach to determining provenance by way of simultaneous U-Pb dating and trace element fingerprinting of detrital zircon, monazite, and rutile, along with Hf and common Pb isotope characterization of detrital zircon and feldspar, respectively.  Results will be compared to potential source rocks in the North Australian craton, South Australia craton, and East Antarctic craton.  Previously collected sedimentary samples from East Antarctica will also be included in this study in order to expand knowledge of the Precambrian basement geology of that ice-covered continent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There has been increasing attention given to locational data from smartphones as a way to enhance epidemiological modeling and predict outbreak progression, transmission, and exposure risk. When combined with artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms, these high resolution data have the potential to vastly improve the granularity and precision of infection and hospitalization estimates. However, the use of locational data raises serious social, ethical, and technical challenges. Trade-offs between the potential public health benefits and the impacts for privacy and civil liberties have started to be debated in earnest within the context of the current pandemic, especially in light of increasing use of these data by private companies to promote targeted advertisements, evaluate retail consumer behavior, and model travel demand, among other applications. Furthermore, the use of these data in the public interest is undermined by an incomplete understanding of the representativeness and bias embedded in these data, particularly in relation to under-represented and vulnerable communities. What is not yet known is the extent of this bias in locational data and how the public health benefits of using these data diminish with spatial and temporal aggregation, which could help to minimize privacy concerns in the collection and use of these data. To address these questions, this project will develop computational models derived from large-scale locational data to (1) estimate the exposure density across a range of temporal (hourly, daily, etc.) and spatial (census block, neighborhood, etc.) scales, which will enable officials and researchers to evaluate and predict transmission rates in a particular area; (2) measure and evaluate the extent and effectiveness of social (physical) distancing efforts over time and comparatively within and across counties and cities, as well as understand the disparate impacts on vulnerable communities and populations; and (3) measure the extent of disease spread based on movement and travel patterns between neighborhoods and communities, which will support predictions of the spatial-temporal patterns of disease outbreak and identify ?at-risk? locations based on the aggregated mobility trajectories for areas were infections have been identified or suspected. <br/><br/>The project team is particularly concerned with how shelter-in-place orders and exposure risk disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities, and the implications of potential bias in locational data in assessing socioeconomic variations. The project will assess how the usefulness of these models for epidemiologists and public health officials varies with spatial aggregation (e.g. is neighborhood level data superior to county level data) and temporal aggregation (e.g. is a near-real-time model superior to daily or weekly timescales) and provide quantitative performance assessments that can be used for collective decision-making on the trade-offs between health benefits and privacy risk.

The techniques that will be used to achieve high-quality include:<br/><br/>(1) linking ""background data"" to the data sets to enable quality-checking and fraud detection. For example, ensuring that hospital information listed in the medical resource database is annotated with an accurate phone number so that a volunteer can contact the hospital and check on the accuracy of the data, and <br/><br/>(2) creating new ""join keys"" to enable easy integration of data in the auxiliary database with other data. The project will work closely with other related COVID-19 RAPID efforts which are working on various aspects of data and information collection from the Web.<br/><br/>The project will focus on creating two high-quality databases using these strategies: <br/><br/>(1) A unified medical institution auxiliary database, which will be a database of all known US medical institutions and <br/>(2) A unified government office auxiliary database, which will be a database of all known government offices in the United States?city halls, courts, licensing offices, etc.?at any level of government. <br/><br/>Both these data sets are crucial for ensuring that citizens receive a base level of medical aid and government assistance. These resources would be beneficial not only for this particular pandemic, but would become essential resources, in general, for the future. <br/><br/>The proposed auxiliary data set creation infrastructure will include a rich schema of background information, used for quality-checking, and a set of join keys for data integration. While there is a huge array of medical institution data sets online, many of the data sets are misaligned due to lack of standard names and/or data integration keys since different projects make different local decisions in choosing these values that may not be universally compatible. As a result, the background information becomes less rich and makes integration with data from other institutions or analysis pipelines much more difficult. The strategies used to create this infrastructure would include: <br/><br/>(1) synthesis of preliminary auxiliary datasets, which includes generating common, candidate attributes for all objects in the input set, for example, creating a helipad field for hospitals based on examining all hospital data in Wikidata; <br/>(2) identification of inputs with missing values, and filling in those values with a combination of Web extraction tasks and crowdsourcing tasks, and <br/>(3) flagging values that are suspected of being incorrect by, for example, automatically creating a set of machine-learned predictors for each column in the auxiliary data.

Random numbers are widely used in secure communications, Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic modeling.  A completely new mechanism for massive-parallel ultrafast random number generation is proposed. The random number generation rate that can be achieved with this scheme will be several orders of magnitude higher than the fastest physical random bit generators reported to date. The device is compact, robust and energy efficient.  Such a parallel ultrafast random number generator is expected to have a broad impact on information security, cryptography, authentication, data integrity, and Monte Carlo simulations, etc..<br/><br/>The ever-increasing demand to improve the security of digital information has shifted the field of random number generation from relying solely on pseudo-random algorithms to employing physical entropy sources. Ultrafast physical random number generators are key devices for achieving ultimate performance and reliability in communication and computation systems. Parallel random bit generation schemes can greatly improve the generation rate and scalability by producing many random bit streams simultaneously. The aim of this project is to develop a massive-parallel ultrafast random bit generator. It is based on a novel scheme of spatial demultiplexing of a highly multimode semiconductor laser. Ultrafast beating of numerous lasing modes produces distinct temporal fluctuations of emission intensities at different spatial locations. These random fluctuations enable parallel random bit generation in 100 to 1000 spatial channels. Each channel can produce independent random bit stream at a rate up to 1 Tb/s. The cumulative rate will approach 1 Pb/s, which is three orders of magnitude higher than the fastest physical random bit generators reported to date. The quantum mechanical noise will guarantee the true randomness of the generated bits. The preliminary studies have provided the proof-of-concept demonstration.  Systematic experimental and numerical studies will be conducted to (i) understand the origin of randomness and quantify the entropy generation rate, (ii) find the fundamental limits for the number of parallel channels and the speed of random number generation, (iii) integrate photodetectors with the laser on a chip, and (iv) achieve real-time generation of random bit streams with direct interface to a computer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will leverage cutting-edge simulations, modeling, and visualizations of urban social and infrastructure systems to understand how human behavior changes in response to shelter-in-place policies may expose potential interdependent and cascading social vulnerability to COVID and weather extremes. The primary research question is: How will existing vulnerabilities to health, weather, and economic hazards be affected by new guidelines designed to reduce COVID-19 transmission rates in NYC? The primary outcome will be to advance knowledge for understanding COVID-19 impacts in the national epicenter of the virus outbreak and where solutions will be needed for many months as the pandemic begins to interact with weather dynamics and drive interdependent vulnerability over time. <br/><br/>As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves rapidly in NYC, there is an urgent need to collect data on social and economic impacts as they emerge, and join these with existing local, regional, and national datasets to anticipate potential interdependent impacts of COVID-19 as weather dynamics shift over coming months. Social survey and social media data are especially critical to collect now as perspectives on location specific experiences and perspective of green space as critical infrastructure can change over time. Additionally, social media data can only be accessed cost-effectively via Twitter in weekly intervals and analyses are needed now to understand policy impacts in time to plan responses and strategies for resilience to interdependent COVID-weather extremes impacts. A convergent scientific approach is critical for examining how vulnerable populations may be further impacted as spring turns to summer with potential heat waves and extreme rainfall events. The analysis will examine how overlapping vulnerabilities interact with availability and usage of urban green spaces for physical and mental health during COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, data will include weekly geo-located tweets overlaid with buildings and green space spatial data to explore dominant locations of social media activity in NYC to understand which parks and open space are most used, and which will require additional resources to meet public need for physical and mental health. This data will provide input to real-time decision-making in NYC to impact current emergency responses, planning and policies that consider direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19, weather extremes, and interdependent vulnerabilities. There remains limited systemic understanding of what forms resilience to COVID-19 should take, especially when considering interactions with additional drivers of social vulnerability. Thus, the broader impacts of this research lie primarily in direct engagement with local practitioners?governmental officials, non-governmental organizations, community organizations?to improve their ability to conduct integrative planning and improve real-time decision-making to reduce social vulnerability and plan emergency response in the novel context of ongoing COVID-19 transmission that may be combined with weather-related extremes. Further, research will be provided to current NSF Growing Convergence Research (GCR) collaborators in Atlanta, Phoenix, San Juan (PR), and across the cities in the UREx Sustainability Research Network. (SRN), seeding opportunities to replicate methods and findings. The project PIs will train interdisciplinary graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in this convergent science approach and provide an important mechanism to bring scholars with advanced data science skills to gather important emerging data and advance novel research to understand the potential of interdependent COVID-19 and weather-related impacts on vulnerable populations in NYC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Socially relevant scientific outcomes are referred to as Broader Impacts. Education, training, collaboration, broadening participation and raising awareness of the role that science plays in the quality of everyday life are broader impacts that promote science literacy in society.  The National Science Foundation places great importance on the communication of science and its potential to benefit society. While broader impacts are of great importance, achieving them at scale requires addressing challenges in planning and implementing activities that include: 1) finding and sharing resources (funding, infrastructure and personnel); 2) locating and collating information that is diverse, widespread and presented in a variety of ways; 3) addressing the lack of technical expertise and infrastructure for creating websites, videos, and integrating applications such as social media, survey tools and analytic tools; 4) disseminating information and interacting with large, distributed groups; 5) meeting recruitment initiative goals to broaden participation and building collaborations in unfamiliar communities; and 6) measuring success and promoting successful projects. The primary objective of this workshop is to address these issues by exploring the creation of an integrated Gateway for Education, Training, Broader Impacts and Outreach for EPSCoR jurisdictions that would provide infrastructure for researchers, educators, students, project managers, and the general public to access, create, and share information about broader impact activities and resources. <br/><br/>Strategies for realizing the Broader Impacts (BI) of scientific research include using cyberinfrastructure to empower knowledge dissemination, activating effective jurisdictional and regional collaborations that advance scientific research, broadening participation in science, technology and engineering and mathematics (STEM), expanding the scientific literacy of all citizens, and disseminating the importance of STEM research and education. The primary objective of this workshop is to assess the state of the art in existing resources to promote BI, and explore creating an integrated Gateway for Education, Training, Broader Impacts and Outreach for EPSCoR jurisdictions that would provide infrastructure for researchers, educators, students, project managers, and the general public to access, create, and share information about broader impact activities and resources.  Participants will achieve the following during this event: 1) identify BI and outreach needs of the EPSCoR community; 2) identify, introduce, and evaluate BI resources and tools from well-established groups such as the Center for the Advancement of Informal Science Education and the Institute for Broadening Participation; 3) identify what functionality gaps exist in the current BI platforms that are required by the EPSCoR community; 4) create a set of BI ?user stories? (i.e. use cases) that would be used to document the requisite functionality; 5) discuss how the development of a EPSCoR BI network could be integrated into a Hub or Ecosystem for the broader community; and  6) identify funding opportunities to develop, pilot test, scale and sustain the system.

Students from a Hispanic-serving institution will learn modern geologic techniques, such as geologic mapping, geochronology, paleomagnetism, and thermochronology, that can be applied to their graduate and post-graduate careers. Analytical data from this research will be made available on community databases, and results of the proposed research will be used to construct a publicly-available online learning module.<br/><br/>Recent tectonic models of the southwestern US Cordillera have invoked the subduction of an oceanic plateau, the conjugate Shatsky Rise, as a driver of slab flattening, subduction erosion and arc cessation in Late Cretaceous to Eocene time. Subduction, and subsequent passage of the plateau, likely promoted extension and associated regional paleogeographic changes, such as basin development and block rotations. This study targets the Goler and Maniobra Formations, which are the only Late Cretaceous to Eocene basinal strata located along the interpreted subduction pathway. This research will test the hypothesis that gravitational collapse in the wake of plateau subduction was widespread across the Mojave region in the Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic and led to the development of supra-detachment basins and the exhumation of relict subduction complexes. This research will incorporate new mapping of stratigraphic and structural relationships, combined with magnetostratigraphy, detrital zircon provenance analysis, and basement and detrital thermochronology. This data will constrain the timing and duration of basin formation and enable the evaluation of different tectonic models of basin development. New basin analysis results from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene Goler and Maniobra Formations will provide a crucial link between plateau subduction processes and related surface deformation and will highlight the complexity of tectonic evolution along a highly segmented margin over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most important functions of Abs during viral infection is neutralization, the process whereby Ab binding to viral or host targets prevents viral entry into host cells, thereby thwarting disease. Conventional approaches for determining the functions of pathogen-specific neutralizing Ab (nAb) repertoire are time- and labor-intensive, and thus have only been used to investigate small portions of Ab repertoires. This award will support research to develop a system that enables fast, direct, functional assays that measure viral neutralization activities of Ab-producing cells.  In addition to the strong scientific impact, this award will support cross-disciplinary training postdoctoral, graduate student, and undergraduate student trainees, including women and scientists from historically under-represented groups.  Results from the studies will be disseminated rapidly and in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific meetings.<br/><br/>Until recently, the large-scale analysis of antibody repertoires was cost-prohibitive, owing to their massive sizes. However, over the past decade, novel sequencing approaches, including Ig-seq, have provided unprecedented insight into Ab gene repertoires. However, despite these dramatic advances, our understanding of the functions of Ab repertoires remains incomplete.  Support from this award will advance a droplet microfluidics platform termed PRESCIENT, that enables fast, single-cell (digital) resolution, direct, functional assays that measure viral neutralization activities of Ab-producing B-cells, thereby providing a system for rapidly characterizing a large repertoire of nAbs against viral pathogens. The overall objectives are to deliver: A fully integrated microfluidic platform with dual fluorescence detection capability and system level throughput of at least 10 assays/sec achieved; demonstration that sera from inoculated mice react with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen; and characterization (at single cell resolution) the nAb (functional) repertoire against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-GFP. This RAPID award will thus deliver the first global functional characterization of Abs that neutralize pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, a timely response to the ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 and an important complement to the ongoing computer simulation studies conducted by other labs.

However, very little is known about the contribution of these high-pressure adapted microbial communities to the Earth?s microbiome, their role in biogeochemical cycles, and their relevance for the evolution of early life on Earth. This project will investigate the adaptation mechanisms of high-pressure and high-temperature bacteria that use hydrogen as an energy source to different pressures and hydrogen concentration regimes. An innovative instrument for bacterial cultures at high pressure and temperature will be used to simulate the deep-sea physical (temperature, pressure) and chemical (hydrogen concentration) conditions. This experimental approach provides a unique opportunity to study microbial activity and functions by adjusting pressure conditions dynamically. Gene expression under different pressures and temperatures will also be monitored. Finally, since hydrogen oxidation is considered an ancient metabolic pathway, understanding hydrogen catabolism in these organisms may help to reconstruct the evolutionary history of early metabolism. The researchers will develop lessons and activities to translate the science for middle and high school aged learners. Lectures and lab demonstrations/tours will be delivered at George Mason University and Rutgers University to undergraduate/graduate students as part of graduate-level seminar series.<br/><br/>Culture-based studies of the physiological and metabolic adaptations of high-pressure adapted bacteria are critical to advance understanding of microbial activity and bioenergetic adaptation strategies in deep-sea ecosystems. The main objective of this study is to explore the physiology and gene expression in high-pressure and high-temperature adapted bacteria (thermopiezophiles) that have been isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. One of these bacteria, Nautilia strain PV-1, thrives at elevated pressure and at a temperature of 55°C, and can live off hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide. Experiments aimed at measuring gene and protein expression will be integrated with measurements of stable hydrogen isotope compositions to understand the combined effects of pressure and hydrogen concentration of the growth of thermopiezophiles. More specifically, this project will investigate the expression of the different hydrogenases of strain PV-1 in response to pressures up to 400 atmospheres, and to limiting and non-limiting concentration of hydrogen. Further, this project will investigate how elevated pressures affect the membrane structure of strain PV-1, which is important to maintain cellular integrity and to facilitate membrane trafficking. Finally, this project will investigate the transfer of hydrogen gas from a hydrogen-producing bacterium, Marinitoga piezophila, and the hydrogen consuming Nautilia strain PV-1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will result in concrete approaches for quantifying uncertainty of possible outcomes and provide reliable tools to assist decision makers in designing mitigation strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, a new statistical inference tool will be developed to estimate the key epidemic parameters that describe the nature of the COVID-19 spread in an interpretable manner. These parameters are critical for providing reliable forecasts through real-time simulation of potential outbreaks. The new models will analyze the effects of changing social contact structures on the spread of COVID-19, and account for missing or partial data in a systematic way. The results of this project will contribute to the scientific and mathematical approaches needed to provide effective and quick understanding of future epidemics or relevant phenomena.<br/><br/>Existing epidemic models largely rely on deterministic systems that are unable to quantify the uncertainty critical for decision making. In addition, data analysis and predictive modeling for the COVID-19 pandemic require statistical tools for fitting epidemic models with only partially available data. However, most stochastic models face challenges in the face of missing data. To address this gap, the project team will develop new stochastic compartmental models that extend classical approaches to explicitly account for changes to the social contact network underlying the disease spread. These new developments will be accompanied by likelihood-based methods to infer key epidemic parameters that offer mechanistic interpretations with uncertainty quantification. In particular, missing data such as infection times at the individual level will be accounted for via novel data augmentation techniques.

In the case of COVID-19, the lack of a vaccine, and the limited response to treatment, can lead to possible acute respiratory complications that may nevertheless be non-lethal, provided that patients have access to respiratory support in intensive-care units equipped with ventilation machines. Proactive planning and optimal allocation of resources are key challenges to face in the current emergency.  In this scenario, the project studies the response to the pandemic from a network service point of view. Namely, it aims at determining actionable strategies under which the hospitals' response system can reach an equilibrium state where the spreading of the infection occurs, but the spreading rate does not lead to service overflow. There has been widespread recognition on the need to ?flatten the curve,? representative of the infection spreading, and different strategies to achieve this objective have been enforced by governments across the world. The project?s research can be viewed in this context as a principled approach to predict how ?the curve? will respond to different strategies, whether it can be kept below the hospitals' saturation threshold for a given amount of time, and what is the societal cost required to achieve this objective. <br/><br/>Given a service-rate constraint dictated by hospital capacity and dynamic equations describing the spread of the infection, the project aims at deriving a control policy expressed in terms of public-health policies that meets the-service rate constraint of the local health-care system while minimizing their economic impact. Since societal constraints can make such an optimal strategy cost-prohibitive, or infeasible, the project will also study strategies that, given a certain cost budget, lead to the most desirable (time-varying) arrival rate that minimizes the global mortality rate of the population.  While derived solutions are expected to be optimal in the context of the proposed dynamical-system model, results will also be validated using extensive simulations driven by real population data, in order to demonstrate their wider applicability in a practical setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their widespread use in technology and the arts results in a high cost. It also justifies extensive mining, which has a high environmental and human health impact. The reason for their scarcity is that they were scavenged into the core when Earth separated into a silicate outer layer (mantle and crust) and a metallic core. Even if these elements are highly depleted in the mantle, previous experimental work indicates that they are overabundant relative to expectation for scavenging by the core. Available experiments suggest that the mantle should be completely barren of these elements, which is not what is seen. A likely explanation for this discrepancy between experiments and observations is that the highly siderophile elements were delivered into the Earth's mantle by the late impact addition of meteoritic material after the core had formed. There are differences however between the composition of the mantle and meteorites, notably for ruthenium, and an important question is whether previous experiments reliably predict the scavenging of highly siderophile elements in the core. These experiments were limited in the pressure-temperature conditions that they could achieve and relies on large extrapolations to make inferences about the scavenging efficiency of the core. A new experimental approach relying on the laser ionization of selected highly siderophile elements coupled with experiments done in diamond anvil cells that can routinely reach pressures of 700,000 atmospheres and temperatures of 4500 K, will allow the partitioning of highly siderophile elements to be measured under core formation conditions without relying on large extrapolations. This work will apply a relatively new technique (Resonant Ionization Mass Spectrometry - RIMS) to in situ ultratrace analyses, which can find applications in a variety of fields outside of Earth sciences, including material sciences/development and nuclear forensics.  The project is a multidisciplinary collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist. The project will support two graduate as well as undergraduate students, who will be trained on a multidisciplinary research project. The PIs will also be involved in outreach at the K-12 level through the French-American Science Festival.<br/><br/>The reason for the depletions in highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in the mantle is their removal into Earth?s core, and their subsequent replenishment by late accretion of extraterrestrial material representing ~0.5 % of Earth?s mass. To first order, this model of late delivery of chondritic material to the Earth can account for the abundance of HSEs in the mantle but it fails to explain the elevated Ru/Pt and Pd/Pt ratios in the mantle relative to chondrites and other HSEs. One explanation for these high ratios is that Ru and Pd may be less siderophile or chalcophile compared to other HSEs, resulting in their partial retention in mantle when the core formed. Testing this hypothesis is however difficult because the relevant metal/silicate partitioning experiments have been done at P-T conditions that are quite remote from those that are thought to have prevailed during core formation. The investigators will study the origin of HSEs in Earth?s mantle by applying a novel ultra-trace element quantification technique known as RIMS to measure the concentrations of selected HSEs in metal-silicate experiments done using piston cylinders and diamond anvil cells (DACs). Through this collaboration between geochemists, physicists and instrument developers, an experimental petrologist, and a high-pressure mineral physicist, the research group will study the effect of nano/micro metal nuggets on metal/silicate partition data, and will measure the partition coefficients of Ru, Pd, and Pt at 0?70 GPa and 2100?4500 K, which spans conditions relevant to core formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research leverages the ubiquity of SARS-CoV-2 amid varying community, regional, and national responses to test theories about the transmission of behavioral norms, linking individual characteristics (identities, homophily, transmission biases such as conformity or prestige risk management, and demographics), sources of information about the virus, and effects on transmission. Coupled contagion modeling has tended to be limited to demonstration of concept. The incorporation of real time behavioral response data in the modeling of couple contagion improves prospects for improved epidemic control through the promotion of pro-social behavior.

The models will be parameterized with data collected in the survey. Particular  focus will be given to the consequences of behaviors driven by conflicting messages about seriousness and the appropriateness of different types of interventions for disease transmission.

Such devices could allow doctors and other healthcare professionals to immediately diagnose infected individuals and get them the treatment they need while more effectively containing the spread of this pandemic.<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 is the viral cause of the COVID-19 illness. An antibody-based nanoplasmonic barcode biosensor could a provide real-time, point-of-care diagnostic device. This project will develop such a sensor. The first objective is the discovery of SARS-CoV-2  binding antibodies. To ensure a sufficient diversity of antibodies are identified, three parallel discovery pathways will be pursued: 1) the identification of antibodies that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV spike proteins, 2) the rational engineering of anti- SARS-CoV-1 antibodies to bind SARS-CoV-2, and 3) the in silico, de novo design of novel SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. About four antibody pairs will be selected from the antibodies discovered through the three complementary approaches. The pairs will be used for SARS-CoV-2 detection on the basis of their affinity measured by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance and of the selectivity of their binding to unique epitopes, as monitored by competition ELISA. Finally, the antibody pairs will be used in the design and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 nanoplasmonic biosensors. Nanoparticle signals will only be detected by the biosensors in the presence of virus. The proposed research will enable the more rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to current diagnostic tests, resulting in a better understanding of its spread and more effective containment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The identity of the initial colonizers of these habitats, subsequent invaders, and the repeatability of this process is important for understanding the establishment of ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling. Identifying steps in habitat maturation also shapes conservation strategies for endangered species and rare environments. These processes are virtually unknown in the anchialine ecosystem, which consists of coastal, landlocked bodies of water influenced by fresh and oceanic waters. Anchialine habitats are rare worldwide but are concentrated in Hawaii. Hawaiian anchialine habitats are home to a diverse array of animals, plants, and microbes, many of which are found nowhere else. In 2018 lava flows from the Kilauea volcano created several new anchialine habitats on the east coast of Hawaii, presenting an exceptional chance to examine how ecology emerges in the anchialine ecosystem. The researchers will leverage this opportunity to detail how these unusual habitats change over time. Microbial and animal communities will be characterized as they become established. This research will advance our understanding of the anchialine ecosystem, especially its microbes, which may prove useful for future medical or commercial applications. Underrepresented groups in STEM (including native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders) will take an active role in this research.     <br/><br/>Hundreds of microbial samples will be collected during a time series in anchialine habitats undergoing development. Microbial community structure will be analyzed using DNA sequencing technology. These ?young? communities will be compared to ones previously characterized from other, ?mature? Hawaiian anchialine habitats. This research will address the repeatability of anchialine community formation and whether new habitats are converging on microbial communities similar to those in established habitats. To complement these microbial analyses, presence and abundance of a keystone shrimp species in the new anchialine habitats will also be assessed. Population genomic tools will be used to test the origins of the colonizing shrimp, as the lava flows may have caused local extinctions in this species. Physiological experiments in shrimp will also be performed to examine thermal adaptations stemming from elevated temperatures due to volcanic activity. Because shrimp act as important grazers on the microbial communities, correlations between shrimp abundance and microbial community composition will also be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reliable extraction of this information, however, requires that we understand the relationships between the processes that transport sediment over the Earth?s surface and the landscapes that they create. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the role of debris flows in shaping steep landscapes. Debris flows are mixtures of mud, rocks, and other incidental debris (such as trees) that can travel at high speeds down valley networks. Their large size, rapid motion, and episodic behavior pose hazards to life and infrastructure. They also erode the valleys they travel through, contributing to the shape of steep landscapes. Debris flows are thought to be a dominant mechanism for transporting sediment and eroding bedrock in steep terrain, but we currently lack a mathematical framework to describe how landscapes respond to erosion by debris flows. In this project, the investigators will develop a model to predict how debris flows erode landscapes and apply this model to understand how changes in tectonics, climate, and land-use influence topography and the sediment volumes passed on to downstream rivers and reservoirs. The project will improve our ability to extract information about tectonics and climate from topographic data and will contribute to resolving a long-standing debate regarding the relative importance of debris flows and water-dominated flows in sculpting bedrock channel networks. This project will train one postdoctoral researcher, one PhD student, one MS student, and three undergraduate students. Two of the undergraduate students will be recruited through the University of Arizona ASEMS (Arizona?s Science Engineering and Math Scholars) program, which is designed to support underrepresented students in STEM fields. The investigators will also produce online community learning tools, lead in-person clinics that support students and researchers in using the model and analysis tools developed through the course of the project, and give guest lectures at a public high school.<br/><br/>Debris flows are thought to be a primary driver of erosion in many steeplands but we currently lack a generalizable, mechanistic approach for quantifying debris flow erosion within landscape evolution models. As such, our ability to predict the dynamics of steeplands, including their geomorphic responses to tectonic, climatic, and anthropogenic forcing, is limited. This project will address three fundamental questions related to the geomorphic role of debris flow erosion: 1) How can we quantify erosion by episodic debris flows over geologic timescales?, 2) How does debris flow erosion influence the morphology of quasi-steady state landscapes?, and 3) How does debris flow erosion influence transient signals (e.g. knickpoints) propagating through the channel network? To address these questions, the investigators propose to analyze debris flow dominated landscapes in the Oregon Coast Range (OCR) and the San Gabriel Mountains (SGM), conduct a field campaign designed to relate changes in landscape morphology to tectonic forcing and environmental factors, and develop a novel landscape evolution model that incorporates debris flow erosion. The debris flow erosion model will employ process-based equations for debris flow motion that honor the discrete nature, transient flow dynamics, and limited mobility of debris flows that differentiates them from water-dominated flows. From this detailed picture of nonlocal debris-flow dynamics, the investigators will then calculate debris flow erosion within bedrock channels integrated over geologic time. The model will be validated through comparisons with topographic analyses of channel network properties and millennial-scale erosion rates in debris-flow-dominated valleys in the OCR and SGM. They will apply their process-based modeling approach in combination with data and observations from our study sites to derive a geomorphic transport law for debris flow erosion, quantify the impact of debris flow erosion on the form of steady state landscapes, and explore how debris flows influence the propagation of transient signals through the channel network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This cloud-hosted service democratizes access to advanced computing by providing intuitive interfaces for both registering remote computers as function executors and executing functions on these computers reliably, securely, and with high performance. Researchers can thus decompose monolithic applications into collections of reusable lightweight functions that can be run wherever makes the most sense, for example where data reside or where excess capacity is available. By simplifying access to specialized and high performance cyberinfrastructure and decreasing the time to discovery, the project serves the national interest, as stated in NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science. A total of 33 diverse science, cyberinfrastructure, and software institute partners working with cutting-edge science applications and research cyberinfrastructure will directly benefit from the funcX platform.<br/><br/>This project develops funcX, a scalable and high-performance federated platform for managing the remote execution of (often short-duration) functions across diverse cyberinfrastructure systems, from edge accelerators to clusters, supercomputers, and clouds. funcX allows developers to decompose applications into collections of functions that can each be executed in the best location, in terms of cost, execution time, data movement costs, and/or energy consumption. It thus integrates the extreme convenience of the function as a service (FaaS) model, developed in industry for specific industry applications, with support for the specialized needs of scientific research. funcX addresses important barriers to these new uses of research cyberinfrastructure systems, by enabling the intuitive, flexible, and scalable execution of functions without regard to physical location, scheduler architecture, virtualization technology, administrative domain, or data location. Flexible open-source funcX agent software makes it easy to expose arbitrary computing systems as funcX computing platforms, thereby transforming existing cyberinfrastructure systems into high-performance function serving environments (endpoints). The cloud-hosted funcX service provides a REST interface for registering functions, discovering available endpoints, and managing the execution of functions on endpoints, all via a universal trust fabric and standard web authentication and authorization mechanisms. It dynamically creates and deploys containers that incorporate function dependencies and provide a secure and isolated environment for safe function execution. The project engages a diverse set of 11 science partners, 18 research computing and cyberinfrastructure projects, and 4 NSF Software Institutes, each supporting many NSF-funded researchers, to provide use cases for funcX, shape its design, and evaluate its implementation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The country is facing a life-threatening health crisis and associated economic fallout. That stress is exacerbated by unexpectedness, unpredictability, contradictory and uncertain information, and low personal control. At the same time, people are asked to adopt a series of unfamiliar social distancing and hygiene behaviors in an attempt to ?flatten the curve? of the coronavirus?s spread. Enacting the CDC-recommended behaviors requires both emotion regulation and effortful self-control. Research on emotion regulation ? the ways people attempt to alter or change their own emotions ? distinguishes among several strategies such as looking for a ?silver lining? in upsetting events, reaching out for social support, intellectualizing the problem, and distraction with television and games. The coronavirus pandemic provides a unique set of circumstances in which to examine how reliance on different emotion regulation strategies predicts people?s health-related behaviors and emotional well-being given these unusual circumstances. Findings from this research will inform future public policy recommendations that encourage health-promoting behaviors in stress-related situations.   <br/><br/>This research examines the extent to which daily use of 16 distinct emotion regulation strategies predicts adoption/maintenance of CDC-recommended social distancing, hygiene and healthy social engagement behaviors. The research also examines how these emotion regulation strategies influence various prosocial and antisocial behaviors, psychological well-being, and loneliness. For three weeks, participants complete a daily questionnaire measuring their use of specific emotion regulation techniques that day; every seventh day they also answer questions about their behavior (e.g., mask-wearing, avoiding social gatherings, technology-mediated socializing, donating money or supplies, hoarding), as well as loneliness, anxiety, and depression, during the previous week. Data analyses will ask which emotion regulation strategies, or combinations of strategies, predict the most desirable profile of behavioral and well-being outcomes.

The central innovation is to focus on individual embodiment in day-to-day streetscape scenes, as revealed in latent and overt spatial behavior through body language in public places. This will be accomplished through first-person video footage of everyday streetscape scenes from a group of recruited volunteers as they go about daily activities during a pandemic. The data will be hand and machine coded to explore patterns of spatial behavior that can indicate relationships between individuals, the built environment, and socio-behavioral phenomena. Emergent relationships will be fine-tuned, using a series of studio-based experiments after the fact, deploying motion capture to methodically and empirically trace-out pathways between non-verbal communication such as gestures and mannerisms, and high-resolution space-time details of spatial behavior, in a controlled setting that utilizes the collected video data as ground truth.

Unfortunately, as we have seen very clearly with COVID-19, once this jump into the human population occurs, it may be too late to stop the infectious disease from spreading rapidly. A novel solution to this problem is to extinguish high-risk pathogens circulating within animal populations before they can jump into the human population. One way this can be accomplished is by developing a vaccine for the animal population that is capable of transmitting itself from one animal to the next, vaccinating each animal against the pathogen as it spreads. Recent advances in genetic engineering have made the development of this sort of self-disseminating vaccine possible. What we do not yet know, however, is if such a vaccine would be an effective tool for eliminating coronaviruses (like the virus that causes COVID-19) from the wild bat populations within which they normally circulate. This research will use mathematical and computational models to evaluate the feasibility of this approach and lay the groundwork for developing new types of vaccines that reduce the risk of emerging infectious disease.  This research project will also support the training of a first generation female graduate student at the interface of mathematics and infectious diseases.<br/><br/>The proposed work will develop mathematical and computational models evaluating the feasibility of using a transmissible vaccine to reduce the prevalence of SARS-like coronaviruses within wild Rhinolophus bat populations. These models will be parameterized using published data on coronavirus prevalence and seroprevalence within wild bat populations and data on bat population structure, demography, and ranging behavior.  Parameterized models will predict the outcome of interventions employing vaccine vectors with different degrees of transmissibility and thus set boundaries on the vectors that could be used to engineer an effective transmissible vaccine. In addition to advancing our ability to reduce the threat of emerging infectious disease, the proposed work will provide training at the interface of mathematics and infectious disease for a graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disease associated with this virus (COVID-19) has higher complication and fatality rates for the elderly and those with comorbidities; however, transmission occurs among individuals of all ages, including individuals who are pre-symptomatic or have mild illness. Interventions aimed at containing the spread of the virus rely on retracing the contact history of individuals who have tested positive for the virus. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and the numbers of cases rise, thorough contact tracing may be impractical. As a supplement, molecular data obtained from patient samples, such as viral genetic sequences, can be used to recreate the epidemic history. Through phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses, virus genomes can be arranged in structures similar to a family genealogy tree, reconstructing transmission histories, even when much of the history is unknown or unreported. Such an approach is, therefore, invaluable in immediately understanding the behavior of rapidly spreading viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, when contact tracing is problematic. Further, mathematical modeling can be applied to the transmission trees to predict rates of growth and spread in the near future. <br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to overcome limitations identified as problematic in the molecular epidemiological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 ? namely sampling bias ? and to infer putative transmission networks that involve a critical mass of linked cases and that are predicted to require immediate public heath prioritization. The project will expand on an existing molecular analysis framework, the Dynamic Identification of Transmission Epicenters (DYNAMITE), incorporating a modified data sampling strategy for more reliable reconstruction of historical spread, the use of growth modeling, and a basic visualization component for user-friendly data interpretation in real time. Additionally, this project will move toward an interoperable implementation of code to be integrated with other software tools. The project development will be guided by focus groups, involving leaders in the field of phylogenetics, epidemiology, and public health.

Many universities announced in mid-March 2020 that all courses taught in classrooms will be delivered online for the remainder of the semester. This requirement means that faculty have no choice but to change their teaching practices immediately. The requirement to rapidly change teaching practices across the country has rarely occurred. In this instance, it may mark a critical time of change in how university courses are taught and how university faculty view teaching. University teaching practices, particularly in technical fields, have been notoriously slow to adapt to changes in technology and a growing understanding of best-practices under a variety of educational circumstances. For instance, lecture is no longer recognized by education researchers as the most helpful for all types of learning. The unfolding response to the COVID-19 mandate to teach remotely (online) provides a unique, one-time opportunity for ground-breaking research to study how crisis-induced changes to instruction influence faculty?s teaching experience. RAPID response funding will enable real-time documentation of the faculty experience during this crisis and help explain the results of studies of teacher-design instruction generated during the COVID-19 event. The results of this study will help future efforts to build faculty?s sense of community around teaching. Building a greater sense of community around teaching will benefit society by improving teaching practices which in turn will improve student persistence, learning, and engagement. Such improvements can ultimately lead to engineering graduates who are better prepared to tackle the diverse challenges that society faces now and into the future. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to identify cognitive and emotional themes concerning faculty and staff adaptability and community engagement during a crisis compared to those found under typical teaching circumstances. To accomplish this goal, the objective of this work is to track changes in the teaching experiences of faculty and staff during a crisis by collecting and analyzing data acquired through surveys and interviews. Two research questions will guide the project: 1) During a crisis, how do engineering faculty and staff experience a sudden change in course delivery (with a focus on cognition, emotions, and community engagement)? 2) How do these experiences vary throughout the duration of the crisis? A hybrid convergent and sequential mixed-methods approach will be used to track the teaching experiences of faculty as the crisis progresses. Data collection will be guided by the adaptability framework dimensions of cognition and emotions with additional data being collected around community engagement. Data collection will consist of brief weekly surveys (n=75) and three semi-structured phenomenographic interviews with engineering faculty (n=10) and the staff who support them (n=5) spread over the remainder of the semester. This work will contribute fundamental knowledge on faculty?s adaptability and community engagement in the face of an urgent need to deliver courses differently and could help shape the design of professional development opportunities that promote adoption of research-based pedagogies and instructional technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But the temperature of the surface itself can vary dramatically in a few short steps, say on the barefoot walk from a grassy picnic area across hot sand to the cool water at the beach.  This mismatch in spatial scale between the patchy land surface and the broad-brush atmosphere poses a challenge for understanding how the two interact: each patch of land interacts with the patch of air directly above it, yet the atmosphere somehow smooths out the patchiness and responds to the aggregate effects of the moisture, heat, and other inputs it receives from the surface.  <br/><br/>As a practical matter some of this aggregation must be explicitly coded into weather and climate models as it is not possible to represent every distinct patch of the local land surface on the global grid of a weather or climate model.  The standard strategy for such aggregation is to represent surface patchiness through the use of multiple ""tiles"" within each surface grid square (the grid squares can be 50 kilometers wide or wider). Tiles represent distinct land surface types, for instance paved urban environments, farms, forests, and lakes, each with appropriate values of reflectivity, roughness, drainage, and other parameters that regulate land-atmosphere coupling.  The percentage of the grid square covered with each tile is specified, and the exchanges of heat, moisture, momentum, and constituents are summed over the tile fractions to form grid totals which are shared with the atmosphere.  Climate simulations generate a tremendous amount of tile data, which could provide a valuable resource for understanding land-atmosphere interactions and their climatic consequences.  Yet tile data is rarely archived with climate model output, which generally contains only the grid square totals.<br/><br/>This project seeks to exploit the untapped resource of tile-level data for understanding land-atmosphere coupling and its implications for large-scale climate.  The PIs have organized an effort to collect this data as part of the Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) so that results from multiple models can be compared.  Data is collected for two specific simulations, one which considers the effects of deforestation assuming a fixed carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and another in which CO2 increases substantially following a scenario of future emissions (SSP3).<br/><br/>A key issue in the research is differences in climate that can be related to the representation of soil reservoirs of moisture, heat, and nutrients.  In the commonly used ""shared column"" approach all tiles within a grid box share the same soil reservoir, while the ""independent column"" approach uses a separate soil reservoir for each tile within a grid box.  The PIs argue that the independent column approximation leads to more extreme grid box surface temperature as, for example, a tree-covered tile only has access to soil moisture within its own tile and is thus more prone to drought.  Nevertheless this may be a better representation of the hydrology as plants with similar functional traits are often found together, and the extent of water sharing across a grid box may be limited as grid boxes are typically much larger than the distances over which water can percolate and heat can diffuse.<br/><br/>The database of tile outputs from multiple models constitutes an important broader impact of the project.  It serves as a resource for the community of researchers working on land-atmosphere coupling and its role in climate, and for model developers seeking to improve models used to provide weather predictions and climate projections for decision makers.  The tile data can also be used to assess the likely climatic consequences of climate change over regions with particular ground cover, for instance the data can reveal characteristic differences in water availability between grasslands and forests in a warming climate.  The project also supports a graduate student and a postdoc, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In higher education, college teachers and students have had limited time to adapt to the new normal of online learning, while observing increasingly stringent shelter in place ordinances and coping with the stress and grief that comes with a worldwide health crisis. This project will investigate how the pandemic has impacted faculty, staff, and students in STEM education, with a particular focus on engineering. The opportunity to collect this data right now, as the crisis unfolds, underscores the need for RAPID funding. The research team will use an online data collection platform, called SenseMaker, to collect short stories from faculty, staff, and students that describe how they are experiencing the COVID-19 crisis and transition to online learning. These stories will be used to help administrators respond to challenges in real time. Data from the study will also be used as the basis for future work, which will focus on what organizational and cultural aspects of STEM higher education can help universities better prepare for future disruptions. This RAPID project will be the first time that the SenseMaker approach has been used to investigate how university programs cope in times of crisis. SenseMaker has previously been used to investigate community experiences in other crisis contexts, such as how different stakeholder groups adapted to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico (see NSF award: 1832678). <br/><br/>This project will use a novel research method, SenseMaker, to capture systems-level dynamics in a College of Engineering as they emerge in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Three research questions will be investigated: i) How are students, faculty, and staff in a College of Engineering experiencing the COVID-19 crisis and associated transition to online learning? ii) What aspects of thriving (e.g., autonomy, flexibility, accountability etc.) are particularly salient to engineering faculty, staff, and student experiences? And iii) What actions can be taken to respond, in real-time, based on the SenseMaker findings, to improve the teaching and learning experiences, and general well-being of students, faculty, and staff in a college of engineering? This RAPID project will continue until 1-month after the return to face-to-face classes. Data will entail the continuous collection of micro-narratives of participants? experiences (qualitative data) and responses to a series of survey questions that will prompt participants to make sense of their experiences (quantitative data). These data will be analyzed for patterns to inform immediate actions to improve the experiences of faculty, staff, and students in a college of engineering. These data will also inform future work that will focus on the organizational structures and cultures that contribute to resilient educational ecosystems. The outcomes of this project will include: a) a rich data set of real-time micro-narratives that capture how faculty, staff, and students in a college of engineering experienced the COVID-19 crisis and associated transition to online learning; b) a theoretically-grounded, tested, and validated methodological approach and instrument that can be deployed in times of crisis in STEM programs across the nation to collect real-time data on faculty, staff, and student experiences; and c) a preliminary understanding of what organizational structures and cultures contribute to resilient educational ecosystems and how these structures and cultures can be fostered outside of times of crisis to better prepare STEM programs for future disruptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, most plastic products are made from non-renewable resources and are not degradable in nature. In agriculture and horticulture, there is a need for low-cost, biodegradable and compostable plastics to support the production of food and other agricultural products. More broadly, in other industries, like consumer packaged goods and food-service packaging, there is a growing demand for biodegradable and compostable products. The proposed research will demonstrate scale-up and commercial viability for biopolymers made from lignin, the primary waste product of the paper and biofuel industries. These biopolymers will have mechanical properties comparable to commercial plastics; they will be biodegradable in soil in under 2 years and in industrial composting conditions in under 6 months. At the end of this project, multiple grades of biopolymers will be identified and optimized for applications, such as nursery containers for greenhouses or agricultural mulch film for farmers. The scope of this project will also include the exploration of novel manufacturing processes that will address product applications beyond agriculture and horticulture.<br/><br/>The proposed SBIR Phase II project will advance the development of a new family of biodegradable plastic materials using lignin, an organic waste product from the paper and biofuel industries, as a key low-cost input material treated as a copolymer, rather than a reinforcing filler, such as carbon black.

It will do so by organizing a conference focused on improving undergraduate mathematics education. Over the past five years, studies of undergraduate calculus education have shown that many undergraduate students who initially express interest in STEM majors, become disheartened and change to non-STEM majors after completing a calculus course. To address the need for increased student success in STEM, many efforts have focused on improving instructional practices and high failure rates in the calculus sequence, in particular for underrepresented groups including women and students of color. Such efforts have inspired mathematics departments and university administrators to try to improve mathematics instruction through professional development, course coordination, instructional materials, and student supports. This conference will develop and expand a network of partners to include researchers, mathematics faculty, and administrators.  It will also encourage and support data-informed improvement efforts in undergraduate calculus education and document lessons learned to share nationally.<br/><br/>The conference organizing committee has worked with undergraduate mathematics departments through the NSF-funded Progress through Calculus (DUE-1430540) and Student Engagement in Mathematics through an Institutional Network for Active Learning (DUE-1624643, 1624610, 1624628, and 1624639).  These efforts identified a strong interest among mathematics faculty in participating in a Networked Improvement Community that shares resources, data, and lessons learned regarding implementing and sustaining active learning in the calculus sequence. Sustaining and expanding such efforts requires significant shifts in departmental culture. To this end, the conference has three main goals: (1) Connect conference participants to an existing community of mathematics faculty, researchers, and administrators dedicated to educational innovation in Precalculus through Calculus 2 courses; (2) Leverage these connections to share and generate knowledge of strategies for initiating, implementing, and sustaining cultural change that supports the improvement of courses in the calculus sequence; and (3) Foster instructor development by encouraging participants to share highly effective instructional practices and tasks for an active learning classroom. Speakers from different institutions will share their research during concurrent workshop sessions focused on four major themes: attention to equity, diversity and inclusivity in the classroom; departmental culture and change strategies; course and curriculum redesign; and professional development. These sessions will actively involve attendees, reflecting the conference?s commitment to the use of evidence-based instructional practices to best support learning. In addition to the sessions, there will be a panel of university administrators who have supported successful change efforts, to engage participants in a discussion on how to leverage administrator support when making changes to the calculus sequence. There will also be two plenary sessions to focus on issues of equity, institutional change, and the roles of faculty and administrators.

The episodic but unpredictable earthquakes from these subduction zones generate undersea landslides called turbidites that produce dangerous tsunami waves that can inundate coastal cities, producing epic damage and large-scale fatalities.  The 2011 Tohoku earthquake, turbidite and resulting tsunami that claimed 15,899 deaths in Japan is a recent example of this hazard, where the damage to infrastructure continues to the present day.  The 1964 Magnitude 9.2 Alaska margin earthquake and tsunami was the largest seismic event to hit the United States in modern times, causing over $2.3 billion dollars in damage and pointing clearly to the potential risks of subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis to U.S. coastal cities.  The recently-conducted National Scientific Foundation Community Seismic Experiment deployed ocean bottom instruments in a 14-month off-shore experiment on the Alaska margin in order to assess this risk. An additional suite of sensors and data loggers was added to this experiment by the University of Washington, specifically to evaluate the risk from turbidite currents initiated by Alaskan margin earthquakes.  Within this current project, these new data will be integrated from all of the community experiment sensors in order to (1) determine the minimum magnitude earthquake that can trigger both turbidity currents and tsunamis, (2) produce numerical models to eliminate the production of false positive alarms that are generated from non-seismic Alaskan winter storms and ocean currents, and (3) help assess the potential for the Alaska Subduction Zone margin to produce the large tsunamis that potentially threaten the west coast of the United States and Canada.  The project includes support for a UW graduate student whose PhD thesis includes training in evaluating subduction zone seismic hazards, a numerical modeler who will construct an Aleutian Island regional ocean model to help evaluate false positives produced by storms and local ocean current eddies and an expert in identifying marine landslides on subduction zone margins.<br/><br/>The recent NSF Alaska Amphibious Community Seismic Experiment deployed 74 Ocean Bottom Seismometer instruments in the 14-month off-shore experiment on the Alaska subduction zone margin. In addition, the University of Washington added an additional 105 sensors and data loggers to these seismometers, specifically to identify turbidity currents generated by both local and distant seismic activity and by non-seismic initiation due to winter storms and vigorous ocean eddy circulation.  This study will leverage the availability of the Community Experiment seismic data, bottom pressure and temperature data, and the generation of a regional ocean modeling system ocean circulation model.  The primary goal is to develop improved techniques to correct bottom pressure time series for oceanographic phenomena in order to optimize the identification of long-duration seismic events and sediment gravity flows.  Specifically, the study will integrate the multiple observational proxies which include bottom temperature, pressures at a stable reference site, network-averaged temperatures and pressures, atmospheric pressures and sea surface heights, together with the generation of a numerical model to improve oceanographic bottom pressure predictions and corrections. The seafloor instrument pressure data will also be used to investigate the effectiveness of differencing along-isobaths rather than the traditional approach of using a deep-water single-station reference dataset. The combined Community Experiment data will also be analyzed for short-term temperature signals diagnostic of turbidity currents and more subtle signals of precursory flows and enhanced pressures from long-lived suspended sediments.  If turbidity flows are identified on the Alaskan margin, seismic data and models will be used to assess the triggering mechanisms and slope stability based on swath bathymetry maps, and sediment properties obtained from archive drilling and piston cores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unprecedented closure will have profound impacts on the development of basic reading skills in the early grades, especially for those children in special education or at-risk for learning disorders where remote/online learning is more challenging. Indeed, extended periods without direct instruction, even in a typical 3-month summer vacation period can result in students losing the equivalent of one month of academic performance. A failure to support learning over the twice as long, COVID-19  closures could have dramatic educational implications. Thus, it is crucial to ask 1) Can remote-learning tools based in current research on reading strengthen key reading-related skills in the youngest learners? 2) What aspects of learning to read are amenable to remote technology?  3) Can digital technology that incorporates cutting-edge reading research in a game-based format overcome the decline in reading skills over the unprecedented length of the COVID-19 school closures?<br/><br/>One hundred educators across the U.S. and 2000 of their K-2 students, all prevented from in-person instruction as a result of COVID-19,  will be enrolled in the project. Teachers will incorporate a research-supported, affordable, and technology-based reading instructional program that can be administered in the home to support the development of essential phonological and letter-sound decoding skills with instructional content identical to evidence-based reading instruction in the classroom. Children will be encouraged to play the games at home for 20 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 12 weeks, proctored by teachers during instructional time. Standardized online reading tests will also be administered several times during the COVID-19 school closures.  The research will examine critical factors that moderate reading gains with training, including onset of the training (relative to school closing), duration/intensity of practice, and individual differences in component skills at onset of the study. The research will also assess whether educational technology can serve to prevent closure-related deterioration in reading development by comparing pre- and post-testing for these children with comparable populations not enrolled in the study. Results from this investigation will allow researchers to assess factors that lead to successful learning through educational technology with minimal in-person guidance, which may guide future development and refinement of these remote learning tools. Further, the study is significant as it will not only assess the detrimental impact of COVID-19 school closures on learning to read but also provide direct means to potentially support educators and students who are in dire need of evidence-based remote instructional tools. Such knowledge can be helpful in possible future closures and can provide evidence-based guidance on how to teach students in remote areas within the U.S. where trained reading specialists are not readily available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In accordance with CISE policy, the award will support the 9 students from U.S.-based educational institutions and will also partially support the panelists as well as 3 foreign-based students in order to broaden the horizons of all participants (many of whom may never have attended an international conference).  This 2-day event will take place on April 25-26 in conjunction with the ACM 2020 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2020) sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI), which will be held April 25-30 in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The annual CHI conferences are the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and they are attended by more than 3,000 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about this year's conference, is available online at https://chi2020.acm.org/.  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  To increase the broad impact of the event, the organizers are committed to diversity.  Due to timing issues, the student participants for 2020 have already been selected; there are a total of 20 students (approximately 10 females and 10 males) who represent a wide range of topic areas and backgrounds; in addition, no more than two students will be from any given institution.<br/><br/>The CHI Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  This year's DC will once again adopt the successful schedule implemented a few years ago, where the group breaks into clusters of 3-4 students paired with one faculty panelist.  Each student participant will have a time slot of approximately 20 minutes in which to make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research and to receive feedback both from the faculty panelist and the other student participants.  The feedback will be constructive and geared to help the students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other HCI research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Follow up activities, including two poster sessions, are planned during the technical program of the conference, and the students' work will be published in the CHI 2020 Extended Abstracts.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral research consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will leverage the expertise of the investigators to develop a simple and effective approach for extending the usable life of N95 respirator masks and similar personal protective equipment (PPE). The investigators will explore the application of commercially available polyelectrolytes (a polymer with a repeating charged unit) as thin film coatings on the masks. These coatings can potentially deactivate enveloped viruses such as SARS-COV-2, increase the barrier to penetration by viral particles, and maintain performance integrity after solvent-based sterilization protocols. An independent laboratory will evaluate the performance of the modified masks relative to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) N95 standards. Clinical professionals at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, a region currently battling the highest infection rate, will test prototype masks and work with the investigators to perfect the coating procedure. The outcome of the project will be a coating protocol that uses non-toxic components and can be applied by end users in a hospital setting on procured masks. Findings will be made immediately accessible to the public through pre-print servers, public repositories such as the Open Science Framework, and social media platforms. Accordingly, society can work together to mitigate the impact of the PPE shortage and minimize further infections through clinician-patient contacts. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to develop a simple and effective post-processing step to coat manufactured nonwoven polypropylene materials, e.g., N95 mask filters, in polyelectrolyte solutions. This is expected to impart a thin, uniform conformal coating exhibiting a semi-permanent charge. The polyelectrolyte coating will extend the usable life of existing medical PPE supplies by enabling use of common sterilization procedures. The polyelectrolyte coating may also augment the protective capabilities of PPE by enhancing material filtering efficiency and/or providing novel antiviral activity. The investigators will evaluate and optimize a coating procedure that healthcare personnel can directly apply to acquired PPE using commodity polymers. Incorporation of alkyl halides in the coating and polymer cross-linking will be explored to yield highly functional and resilient coatings. Scanning electron microscopy will be used to characterize coating uniformity, changes to material fiber structure, and resulting pore size distribution. Breathability after polymer coating will be assessed by measuring air permeation through the mask, and viral deactivation capabilities will be investigated through cytopathic and plaque formation assays with a model Biosafety Level II enveloped virus. An independent commercial laboratory will conduct NIOSH pre-certification testing to assess particle filtration relative to N-series respirator standards. Partners at the Mt.

The key strategy to combat growth in the infection rate is through ""social distancing,"" maintaining physical separation from others. This strategy is incompatible with transit systems and ridership in nearly every transit market has plunged, causing agencies to reduce service levels to protect riders and employees. Still, mobility is required in many cities and the ability of cities to rapidly recover from widespread economic shutdown will require improving mobility systems in urban areas. In the past decade, more diverse shared mobility systems have proliferated, potentially improving the resilience and redundancy of the urban transportation system. Most recently, micromobility systems (i.e., bike share and scooter share) have entered cities and supplemented transportation systems in those areas. As a shared personal mobility vehicle, micromobility vehicles have been highly utilized in some markets in the early weeks of the pandemic even as transit ridership has declined. This is an important opportunity to understand how shared micromobility systems complement transit and can support social distancing to limit spread of disease while also facilitating urban transportation recovery. To that end, this study has two main aims. First, the research team will conduct a series of panel surveys for the duration of the pandemic of transit and micromobility users in two medium-sized transportation markets (Nashville and Portland) that have robust micromobility markets. These surveys will query and model mode choice behavior in relation to social distancing requirements, transit captivity, job status, income, activity restrictions, and others. The research team seeks to understand if riders self-regulate transit use and exposure and balance their behavior with perceived risks. The team will use detailed agency and micromobility operator data to track changes in ridership during recovery. The second aim is to project those findings on more aggregate ridership data of transit and micromobility across cities of different sizes and with different COVID-19 infection rates. This will provide detailed understanding of how riders react to pandemic in regard to two main shared modes; transit and micromobility systems. <br/><br/>To date there has been little work on the response of transit to disease outbreaks. The 2002/2003 SARS outbreak provides some aggregate evidence of long-duration drops in transit ridership. This work will provide important insight into disaggregate rider behavior, disease transmission, and personal- and community-risk tolerance. Moreover, this work will explore how emergent modes, like shared micromobility provide opportunities to maintain mobility while reducing close personal contact. Models developed can help predict how city transit systems will recover after a public health crisis. Public health emergencies will continue into the future and preparation on how to react to such emergencies will be important. For example, micromobility systems may provide much needed transportation services to supplement limited transit service. Understanding the dual roles of micromobility and transit will assist in limiting disease transmission and recovering the transportation system. Policy responses could be based on evidence generated in this study for the current and future infectious disease pandemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the rainy season the analogy has physical significance as the rain falls primarily from mid-depth cumulus clouds which resemble those commonly found over tropical oceans.  Also, the forested surface provides an abundant source of moisture to sustain the clouds, playing the same role as the ocean surface in maritime convection.  But prior work by the PI shows that at the end of the dry season the analogy breaks down and clouds look more like the cumulus towers that form over dry grasslands.  The surface also plays a different role, as the deep clouds are triggered by high values of convective available potential energy (CAPE), and the surface serves primarily as a heat source to build CAPE rather than a moisture source.<br/><br/>Recognizing the differing roles of moist and dry land surface, the principal investigator (PI) considers the role played by plant physiology in cloud formation during the pre-onset season (also referred to as the transition season). Water stress is common at the end of the dry season and vegetation under water stress retains moisture, causing the surface to heat up and promoting higher CAPE.  On the other hand clouds need a source of water vapor, which can be supplied by plant transpiration in adjacent regions where the soil is still moist.  Thus the PI hypothesizes that rising motion induced by surface heating over water stressed regions draws in moisture from regions of low water stress (where plants transpire moisture into the air), so that the gradient between high and low plant water stress plays a key role in promoting convection at the onset of the rainy season.<br/><br/>The research uses observational data from sources including satellite remote sensing and meteorological reanalysis products, together with numerical simulations, to cover the range of phenomena and spatial scales linking plant physiology with clouds and precipitation.  One key data source is satellite-derived Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF), a subtle and wavelength-specific glow emitted by chlorophyll in plants exposed to sunlight.  Previous studies have shown that SIF declines when plants are under water stress, thus SIF from satellites can be used to map the spatial gradient of water stress over the Amazon.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER award focuses on outreach to K-12 and college students from underserved and underrepresented populations.  At the college level the PI works with the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program to provide summer internships for undergraduates from minority serving institutions. K-12 education is addressed in collaboration with the Providence Public Schools (PPS), which serve a high percentage of Hispanic and African American students. The PI's team works with PPS officials to organize summer workshops for elementary and middle school teachers to assist them in creating and implementing lesson modules on weather, climate and ecosystem interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identifying shared genetic changes between human SARS-COV-2 and its relatives in mammalian reservoirs in the bat, pangolin, and civit is important to understanding the virus mode of action. It is especially critical to identify which of the changes contribute to human virulence of SARS-COV-2. The researchers will analyze 3200+ genomes from SARS-COV-2 and coronavirus genomes from animal reservoirs to look at genetic changes associated with virulence and COVID-19 symptoms. To accomplish this work, new software tools will be developed to better leverage modern computer graphics processing units (GPUs) for high-speed parallel computing.  The project will engage graduate students and REU participants in interdisciplinary research of critical national importance and contribute useful tools for future bioinformatic research.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to identify virulence genes that enable SARS-COV-2 to jump species boundaries from vertebrate reservoirs.

Increased case detection, contact tracing, and broad quarantine and social distancing measures, have been vital for containing COVID-19 outbreaks. Mathematical modeling and analysis can provide important insights into the efficacy of these ?contact-based? non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, model parameterization requires detailed case data, which is often challenged by inconsistent, unreported and asymptomatic cases. To overcome these difficulties, the researchers will: develop outbreak models of COVID-19 with quarantine, tracing and social distancing and derive new results on final epidemic size and reproduction number under quarantine measures to flatten and shrink the epidemic curve. The researchers will also integrate case and phylogenetic data for an innovative framework that reveals region-specific control and predicts how to best implement contact-based measures for efficiently containing the outbreaks. Results will be communicated with policymakers, along with scientific and public audiences, in order to have a real-time impact on the coronavirus pandemic.<br/><br/>This project will consider compartmental outbreak models of COVID-19 with responsive quarantine, tracing and social distancing measures. The novel formulation allows for derivation of outbreak size, dependent on contact tracing and broad quarantine intervention parameters.

Sensitivity of epidemic size to combinations of contact tracing and social distancing measures will be assessed to understand viable strategies for flattening and shrinking epidemic curves. Long term scenarios of loosening and tightening of quarantine interventions for sustainable control will be investigated through analysis and simulation of the models.

RFBs have emerged as capable electrochemical energy storage devices capable of compensating for the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like wind and sun. Traditional RFBs rely on expensive metal-based materials and corrosive electrolytes. RFBs that comprise of organic molecules and operate at neutral pH are desirable from a cost and safety perspective.  The research team is developing new RFB based on organic molecules (substituted radialene molecules) with reversible redox behavior in water.  The project lies at the interface of organic synthesis, materials chemistry, and analytical electrochemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of undergraduate scientists.  The three-institution team will plan and fabricate an interactive exhibit on RFBs to expand awareness and engage the regional public regarding grid-scale renewable energy storage. Students involved in the research have the opportunity to work closely with faculty members at each institution and a regional industry partner. This project will reach a broad audience of students and adults alike during demonstrations at various outreach events and local schools with diverse student populations. <br/><br/>Radialenes are cross-conjugated organic molecules that support multielectron transfer and can often be isolated in various oxidation states.

Multifractals, due to their lack of a characteristic scale, may be ideal tools to analyze the spread of viruses, such as COVID-19; the spreading in a large city such as NYC could be similar to that occurring in a small city such as Newark, NJ. Multifractals have been used largely for geophysical data by various groups, and in some cases, to understand the spread of viruses, such as H1N5. This study will use data from the five boroughs of New York City and from Northern New Jersey (namely Bergen, Essex, and Union County). The team already has been collecting data from these communities in a project on community resilience. <br/><br/>The hypothesis of this research is that multifractals can reflect both the scaling behavior and the exponential increase with time. Multifractals also account for the spatial correlation between subjects, and thus could be used to explain connectivity, be it at the individual level or at the level of cities (say NYC and Philadelphia). In addition, a look at the map of cases at the US (or the world scale) reveals spottiness, that is hot zones that are not uniformly distributed in space. The study team believes that the skeleton of the geometry is fractal (because of the lack of scale), and thus will be analyzing multifractals distributed spatially on a fractal network. This approach may open new modes of investigation in various areas, including public health and resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To facilitate the surveillance and control of the spread of the virus, Prof. Singamaneni of Washington University at St. Louis aims to develop a rapid and low-cost diagnostic method that can detect infection in individuals that are asymptomatic or exhibiting mild symptoms.  The sensitive biosensing method is designed to rapidly assess the immune response to the coronavirus across a large population in a high-throughput manner and to enable understanding of the epidemiology of the highly contagious disease. The novel biosensor is suitable for point-of-care and resource-limited settings and can be easily adapted to a broad range of public health threats.

Specifically, the dual-modal lateral flow assay relies on plasmonic-fluor, an ultrabright fluorescent nanostructure, to achieve high sensitivity and low detection limit. In addition to ultrabright fluorescence signal, plasmonic-fluors exhibit large absorption and scattering cross-section, making them attractive labels that can be directly visualized by naked eye at high target concentrations.

Uncertainty in transmission rates and the outcomes of social distancing, ""shelter-at-home"" executive orders, and other interventions have created unprecedented challenges to the United States health care system. This project will address these issues directly using advanced mathematical modeling from dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and networks. The mathematical models, which are formulated with the specific features of COVID-19 in mind, will provide insights that are critical to people on the front lines who need to make recommendations for intervention strategies and human-behavior patterns to best mitigate the spread of this disease in a timely manner. The project will train a postdoctoral scholar, a PhD student, and two undergraduate students in the research needed to solve these complex problems. <br/><br/>The standard approach for epidemic modeling, at the community scale and larger, is compartmental models in which individuals are in one of a small number of states (for example, susceptible, infected, recovered, exposed, latent), with individuals moving between states. The COVID-19 epidemic can be modeled in this way, with resistance as part of the dynamics. The simplest examples of such models for large populations are coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the fraction of a population in each of the states. To model the stochasticity of infection and latency, models with self-exciting point processes can be fit to real-world data. This project compares the dynamical systems and stochastic models of relevance to COVID-19 transmission. The models also incorporate network structure for the transmission pathways. The project extends prior research on contagions on multilayer networks by incorporating multiple transmission methods and coupling between the spread of the contagion itself and human behavior patterns. The project leverages high-resolution societal mixing patterns in epidemics, as they influence both (1) observations and demographics of who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and (2) who transits the disease, sometimes without being diagnosed.<br/><br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Applied Mathematics program and the Computational Mathematics program (Division of Mathematical Sciences), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its prevalence is predicted to triple by 2050 unless further discoveries facilitate the prevention of the disease. Because of challenges in screening for AD, it often remains undiagnosed until cases advance and sufficient neuronal injury has occurred that reversal of the disease is unlikely. What is desperately needed is a cognitive screening tool that can objectively detect at-risk individuals and monitor the disease progression with no specialized staff or medical equipment. Driven by rapid advancements in wearable sensors and their growing social acceptability, this CAREER program will develop novel data analysis approaches required for the early detection of AD. Such a tool could initiate further biomarker testing and early interventions in order to alleviate neuronal damage before it becomes too late. In addition, an integrated educational and outreach program is designed to both foster interdisciplinary research training and to increase participation of underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. This project will create learning modules to target middle and high school students through school demonstrations, on-campus laboratory research, and summer experiences, with a focus on engaging female students at an early stage. It will integrate research outcomes in engineering curriculum with a focus on neurodegenerative diseases in order to ignite interest in engineering education among female and minority students. Knowledge gained from this project will be disseminated via research publications, tutorials, and workshops, as well as broader outreach activities to the area public library, science museum, and stakeholders.<br/><br/>This project is a major departure from current efforts to address current technical obstacles in individualized and longitudinal monitoring. Current data analysis approaches do not consider individuals' variability in their methods. They are trained using data from a well-characterized group of subjects and then applied to a new subject, regardless of differences. As a result, they do not consider the variation of patterns between subjects, which is critical for the detection of abnormal patterns due to the disease versus the differences within a subject. Additionally, none of the existing approaches consider intra-subject variations that may occur over time. This limitation is particularly critical for longitudinal monitoring of the cognitive impairment severity because these approaches are unable to distinguish longitudinal disease-related changes from changes due to aging. The planned approach to address these challenges in both data analytics and clinical practice is as follows. First, the project significantly improves the early detection of at-risk individuals during initial assessments of cognitive decline by developing innovative individualized deep learning approaches. These novel approaches will be based on an encode-decoder architecture to explore raw gait data for features related to cognitive decline, while a novel domain adaptation technique will be developed to customize the architecture according to an individual's variability. Second, it significantly improves the detection of the disease progression rate by developing novel adaptive deep learning approaches for longitudinal monitoring of cognitive decline. The approach will be based on deep learning methods with heterogeneous data fusion ability to enable the analysis of free-walking gait, along with speech data. A novel unsupervised domain adaptation based on reinforcement learning techniques will be developed to customize the model according to the intra-subject variations over time. The key transformative aspect of the proposed research is the development of data analytics that are based on available sensor data, but which provide individualized models that show change over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed system can perform predictions much more efficiently due to a far simpler computational workflow and native AI hardware acceleration. In addition, AI emulators automate the assimilation of vastly higher amounts of remote-sensing and other observational data (e.g., radar measurements from weather satellites or land cover and vegetation data) over numerical models, allowing for increased accuracy, continuous improvement, and dynamic predictions reflecting changing on-the-ground conditions. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the pressing need in the energy and insurance industries to accurately and consistently assess wildfire risk over large geographical regions and at a localized level, on time scales ranging from daily to yearly.

However, the particles can destabilize the film, reducing the transport efficiency and resulting in an ill-controlled deposition and contamination of substrates. The classical description of films of pure liquid fails to capture the interplay between the air-liquid interface and the particles. This CAREER project will characterize and model the role of interfaces in suspension dynamics, using state-of-the-art experimental studies coupled with numerical simulations. The results will advance the fundamental understanding of suspension flows under confinement, establishing when and how particles disturb thin liquid films.

An integrated curriculum on water contamination will inspire the participation of local K-12 and undergraduate students in STEM.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER award is to develop a new understanding of capillary dynamics when solid non-Brownian particles are dispersed in a Newtonian liquid phase. This configuration encompasses a variety of fundamental problems and practical situations. Past studies have focused on surface tension effects during the formation of liquid films and drops of a pure Newtonian liquid. However, when the liquid contains solid particles, the rheological description of a suspension fails to capture the interfacial dynamics at play when the thickness of the liquid becomes comparable to the particle size. The experimental approach bridging different length and time scales will describe how the bulk behavior and local heterogeneities contribute to the dynamics of capillary objects. More specifically, the study will consider model thin films, self-suspended or bound by a solid surface. First, the formation of a thin-film of suspension on a substrate will illustrate how the particles are entrained and deposited depending on the dynamic wetting and stability of suspension films. The researchers will then examine suspension sheets and their atomization to provide guidelines to describe sprays. The fundamental knowledge obtained through the proposed work will lead to a better description of multiphase flows involving a solid dispersed phase during the formation, flow, and fragmentation of suspension films and sheets. In addition to improving process efficiency, the knowledge should bolster the development of new coating processes and inspire further research on heterogeneous capillary flows.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will also provide a framework to facilitate new educational programs at the intersection of computing and biomedical engineering with the goal to promote wider interest in STEM degrees and careers. To engage next generation scientists with computational modeling, the project aims to (i) develop virtual reality-based interactive modules for K-12 students, (ii) develop standards-aligned primary and secondary school classroom curriculum add-ons, and (iii) host implementation workshops to broadly disseminate the material and findings.<br/> <br/>The proposed research program will develop and establish new multiscale, multiphysics modeling techniques that enable users to use parallel fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) models to design new therapeutics in an intuitive and interactive manner. The program couples complementary resources including virtual reality and augmented reality interfaces, massively parallel fluid simulation, and high-fidelity cellular adhesion models. The following key components will be combined: (i) the development of a robust, efficient capability to capture a range of cell types, (ii) a parallel method to initialize high cell densities in complex geometries, and (iii) interactive techniques for design feedback and modification.  The resulting cyberinfrastructure represents a new and potentially transformative FSI engineering paradigm that will lead to advances in fundamental knowledge, more effective research techniques, enhanced clinical capabilities, and cross-cutting impacts that transcend the bioengineering and biomedical fields. The knowledge gained by development of a state-of-the-art, simulation-driven, geometry-interaction methodology will have wide impacts beyond the use cases investigated in the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CMP processes enable cutting-edge manufacturing; currently chipmakers often face scaling difficulties as the size of the smallest features continues to decrease, increasing the impact of CMP imperfections and resulting in higher defect rates. The proposed polishing process enables chip fabricators to reduce these CMP imperfections by 50% and improve performance, while reducing costs and increasing process throughput.  <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve CMP processes with innovative polishing pads. Conventional polishing pads have randomly distributed micropores inside of the pads and typically generate around 1% real contact area between the pad asperities and wafer during polishing. This leads to unwanted polishing results, such as dishing/erosion and scratch defects on chip patterns due to the stress concentration on asperities. Conventional pads require a pad conditioning process to regenerate the asperities on the pad surface. The polishing processes developed under this project use microfabrication technologies to control micro-features on the pad surface. Therefore, the contact area between the pad and wafer is customizable and controllable up to 30%. This will improve the polishing performance precision and consistency, leading to fewer defects. As the micro-features on the soft sub-pad are independent, the conformity of the pad increases and the pressure on the wafer is evenly distributed across the wafer surface. This will significantly improve the chip-level planarization and wafer-level uniformity, and reduce the pad wear.  As a result, the pad conditioning process can be minimized or even eliminated from the CMP process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But social media contain both accurate and inaccurate information. This project will analyze how social media affects the quality of information received by people during the extended crisis. Who receives what information? And in what ways do social media amplify or dampen informational inequalities? The project will build a real-time monitor of information consumption regarding the corona virus, drawn largely from Twitter. Specifically, the project will: (1)  build a real time monitor of information regarding the corona virus that would be made available to state and local officials; and (2) evaluate how a medium such as Twitter amplifies/dampens existing informational inequalities around socioeconomic status.  The project will focus on identification of misinformation (e.g., ersatz cures) that pose health risks. The project will supply aggregate information to relevant state and local officials regarding the type and quality of information regarding corona virus circulating in their communities, thus informing interventions that public officials can make to combat that misinformation. More generally, the project will identify patterns of information that governmental officials can use to combat misinformation during other extended crises, including those with public health as well as other origins.<br/><br/>Responding appropriately to COVID-19 requires that individuals have accurate information about how it is spread and what they can do to mitigate virus effects.  However, misinformation is prevalent, with Twitter being a major source of both accurate and inaccurate information.  This project will utilize a matched sample of 1.8 million Twitter handles and voter registration data. The large scale of the data will permit production of reasonable inferences of content sharing at subnational levels?at the state level, and within regions for large states. Because the Twitter data will be linked to voter registration records, and because voter registration data includes information on age, gender, race, partisanship, and address, thus allowing linkage to census tract information, the project will be able to evaluate the relationship between socioeconomic status and information exposure. Further, the project will augment with a survey of about 2000 of the matched data to further examine the factors that affect the quality of information people receive about the corona virus.

COVID-19, which emerged out of the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 is now spreading in multiple countries. It is particularly concerning that the case fatality rate appears to be higher for the novel coronavirus than for seasonal influenza, and especially so for older populations and those with prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Any plan for stopping the epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Different data collection and testing modalities and strategies available to help calibrate transmission models and predict the spread/severity of a disease, have variable costs, response times, and accuracies. In this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project, the team will examine the problem of establishing optimal practices for rapid testing for the novel coronavirus. The result will be the Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM), which will translate into science-based predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic's characteristics, including the duration and overall size, and help the global efforts to combat the disease. The RTEM will fill an important gap in data-driven decision making during the COVID-19 epidemic and, thus, will enable services with significant national economic and health impact. The educational impact of the project will be on mentoring of post-doctoral and PhD researchers and on curricula by incorporating research challenges and outcomes into existing undergraduate and graduate classes. <br/><br/>Computational models for the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and data- and model-driven computer simulations for disease spreading are increasingly critical in predicting geo-temporal evolution of epidemics as well as designing, activating, and adapting practices for controlling epidemics. In this project, the researchers tackle a Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM) problem: Given a partially known target disease model and a set of testing modalities (from surveys to surveillance testing at known disease hotspots), with varying  costs, accuracies, and observational delays, what is the best rapid testing strategy that would help recover the underlying disease model? Several scientific questions arise: What is the value of testing? Should only sick people be tested for virus detection? What level of resources should be devoted to the development of highly accurate tests (low false positives, low false negatives)? Is it better to use only one type of test aiming at the best cost/effectiveness trade off, or a non-homogeneous testing policy? Naturally these questions need to be investigated at the interface of epidemiology, computer science, machine learning, mathematical modeling and statistics. As part of the work, the team will develop a model of transmission dynamics and control, tailored to COVID-19 in a way that accommodates diagnostic testing with varying fidelities and delays underlying a rapid testing regimen. The investigators will further integrate the resulting RTEM-SEIR model with EpiDMS and DataStorm for executing continuous coupled simulations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded through the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation program (Engineering).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models often differ significantly in their projections and recommendations, reflecting different policy assumptions, as well as scientific, logistical, and other uncertainty about biological and management processes. Such uncertainty can be challenging for policymakers, hindering intervention planning and response. Policymakers may thus choose to rely on single trusted sources of advice, or on consensus where it appears, without confidence that decisions will be the best possible. However, less-than-optimal decisions mean more lives may be lost or more resources used than needed.  In the face of biological, epidemiological, and operational uncertainties, systematic strategies to formalize the process of using multiple models to develop policy can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of policy responses to outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is a major health issue for most countries in the world. This work is intended to directly address this current problem in real time. The work will also provide a framework for future outbreak response.  <br/><br/>Many models to address the COVID-19 pandemic are in development, or recently published. This project will develop multiple-model elicitation protocols, embedded in a strong framework for decision making, that formally acknowledges our uncertainty about this novel pathogen, and avoids known sources of bias. A full acknowledgment and accounting of uncertainty is critical both for decision making and for public communication. Nationally relevant objectives (e.g., minimizing deaths) and interventions (e.g., social distancing) will be assessed during this process. The project will merge formal expert elicitation methods (usually used to elicit opinions from individual experts) with modeling analyses from multiple research groups to enhance decision making for outbreak management. Groups will project disease dynamics under different interventions, and the ensemble of outputs will be analyzed using decision analysis to provide an evaluation of interventions against the policy makers? objectives.

Dealing with this data avalanche poses a special challenge for research that probes the structure and function of brain circuits and systems with techniques such as large scale high resolution light microscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and high density recording of brain electrical activity. The aim of this collaborative project between the University of California San Diego and Yale University is to catalyze such research by enhancing the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG), an existing cyberinfrastructure resource that was originally developed to facilitate projects that need High Performance Computing, such as large scale computational modeling of brain circuits. The current project will enhance NSG by incorporating innovations in high throughput computing (HTC) and data management that are required for research involving large amounts of data, implemented in ways that reduce or eliminate the technical and administrative challenges faced by scientists who need to deal with such data. In addition to enabling data-intensive neuroscience research, these new capabilities will increase NSG's utility in education, where it is already widely used in neuroscience and biology instruction at the undergraduate level and higher. Webinars, workshops, and training classes at various conferences will be presented to students and researchers to learn about NSG's new capabilities. This project will increase NSG's scientific and social value as an open and free resource that democratizes participation in science by enabling access to computing and data resources for students and researchers at all academic institutions. <br/><br/>This project adds HTC features to NSG that have been judged most suitable to meet the large scale computing needs for neuroscience data processing, based on actual and projected use cases provided by neuroscientists engaged in data-intensive research. It incorporates commercial cloud computing and Open Science Grid (OSG) resources, integrating them with NSG?s ability to submit appropriate compute workloads to these HTC resources while maintaining the ease of use features of NSG that allow users to seamlessly exploit these compute resources,. Many of the tools that utilize HTC computing mode are made available via NSG to allow processing of input data and retrieval of output results within the existing web based and programmatic user environment of NSG. Flexibility is also provided for users to directly use containerized images of neuroscience modeling and data processing tools on commercial cloud computing resources. Integration of OSG?s data federation capability allows processing of publicly available large neuroscience data which can be distributed in a scalable manner to HTC resources. Incorporation of various data functionalities such as the ability to transfer large data directly to NSG?s storage, share data among NSG users, access and process data by multiple NSG users, enable researchers to perform a wide diversity of data-driven neuroscience research be it processing of electrophysiological (electroencephalography i.e. EEG, magnetoencephalography i.e. MEG), imaging (fMRI) or behavioral (reaction time, test accuracy) data, correlational analysis of multimodal data, or application of machine/deep learning.

Crises like the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, however, pose a challenge to this long-standing norm that buttresses modern democracies the world over. In the midst of a crisis, a person?s support for the rule of law is tested as their fundamental concern for the health, safety, and welfare of themselves, their families, and their friends is pitted against an abstract belief that the government ?check all the boxes? before carrying out potentially lifesaving policies. In these situations, one?s desire for decisive government action may overwhelm, and subsequently lead to a decline in, one?s commitment to abstract democratic principles like the rule of law. Consequently, evaluating how crises affect support for fundamental democratic norms is critical for understanding their impact on the health and stability of the liberal democratic order.<br/><br/>This project leverages the COVID-19 outbreak to examine this relationship and determine (a) whether governmental responses to crises affect citizens? support for the rule of law; (b) whether citizens? faith in government efforts is buttressed or undermined in response to elite and expert cues; and (c) whether citizens? attitudes change after a crisis has dissipated. Each of these theoretical aims is tied to one of three unique features of the research design, which relies upon surveys of European democracies. First, to examine the effects of governmental responses, the project will make collect survey data on support for the rule of law across four Western democracies in April 2020: Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Second, an original panel survey in Germany will enable the evaluation of changes to individual-level rule of law judgments in the short, medium, and long term.

The workshop outlines the increased impetus and framework for geoscientists to identify geoheritage sites in need of protection for future generations of geoscientists as well as public enjoyment. Additionally, building a useful framework for site description will have the following benefits:<br/>1) As geoheritage sites include both natural and cultural heritage, they provide opportunities for geoscientists to connect with sister disciplines (i.e. arts, humanities, history, ethics, and economics); 2) Geoheritage sites will increase the visibility of the geosciences to the general public; 3) Geoheritage sites make field studies accessible for teacher preparation and ongoing professional development and for local K-12 education. These sites support inquiry- and discovery-based learning; 4) Field instruction is an important component of undergraduate instruction for both non-majors and majors. Sites developed by academic institutions close to their campuses/regular field course sites can be used for educational and outreach purposes for academic coursework, in partnership with local K-12 coursework, to share with courses from other academic institutions, and in collaborative informal educational activities with a variety of stakeholders; and 5) Geoheritage sites are demonstrated drivers of sustainable economic community development, allowing<br/>for collaborative development of geoheritage sites by local governments, civic groups (e.g. chambers of commerce), and contributing geoscientists.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>This workshop will build on work performed since 2011 by the U.S. National Committee for Geological Sciences and its Geoheritage and Geoparks Advisory Group. The goals of the workshop, to be hosted by West Virginia University (WVU)'s Beckley campus, are to:<br/>-Survey and share current strategies and approaches to identify, inventory, and characterize geoheritage sites across America;<br/>-Discuss possible protocols, common terminology, and ""best practices"" for documenting and developing geoheritage sites in state and local settings;<br/>-Consider suggestions for future work to encourage development of geoheritage sites as appropriate in diverse local and state settings;<br/>-Create and support a community of geoscientists and collaborators from the public and private sectors that is dedicated to contributing to a coordinated campaign to identify and preserve U.S. geoheritage sites; and<br/>-Explore ways to encourage use of geoheritage sites by geoscientists, educators, and the general public through a broad suite of dissemination strategies.<br/><br/>Outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated through a summary National Academies proceedings-in brief, an online comprehensive, annotated bibliography, related websites, listservs, newsletters, social media outlets, and publications of sponsoring professional societies to facilitate the development of geoheritage sites by numerous groups across America.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By observing the behavior of park users, this study focuses attention on the complex and potentially opposing roles that parks and other natural and engineered forms of green infrastructure (GI) play in residential neighborhoods of Philadelphia and New York City during the pandemic. The role of parks is complex because while on one hand, visits to these sites can build social resilience by promoting social contact, recreation, leisure, and other psychosocial processes that build trust, generate place attachment, social support, and feelings of belonging and empowerment, on the other hand visits to parks could potentially accelerate spread of this highly contagious disease by creating more person to person contact and/or transmission of the virus to playground surfaces, benches, handrails, bike racks or other surfaces. The overarching hypothesis is that as the pandemic progresses, fewer and fewer people will engage in risky park behavior, but parks will eventually become havens for homeless who seek social distance as infection rates rise in shelters and the weather improves through the spring and summer. <br/><br/>Because of the national shortage of COVID-19 testing, swabbing, sampling, and laboratory testing of parks surfaces is deemed impossible. The focus of this study is instead on the observed behavior of park users, and documentation of usage patterns that potentially pose an elevated risk of infection. This goal is approached through implementation of a novel approach through paid citizen scientists, enabled by digital technology, and designed to promote economic resilience in the very neighborhoods to be studied. The work will be conducted over the course of one full year and contains 12 discreet but interconnected tasks performed in 20-40 strategically selected parks in residential neighborhoods of Philadelphia and New York City. An Advisory Panel will be formed to help guide the work and interpret results. The research will advance knowledge in the fields of urban green infrastructure, citizen science, urban resilience, and social-ecological systems in the context of an unprecedented international pandemic. The PI has extensive interdisciplinary research experience in these fields and has worked collaboratively with governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders in the two cities before. The research will generate novel data sets regarding public use of parks as COVID-19 spreads and will search for correlations between these observations and park and neighborhood characteristics. It will also evaluate the feasibility with which unemployed urban residents can rapidly become crucial human ""sensors"" who collect important fine spatial resolution observations within these two large cities.

In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals as well as enable large scale field monitoring and management in production agriculture.  The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase II project proposes to establish autonomous data collection under-canopy from field crops using a low-cost ground robot.

Long-term field adaptive autonomy will be achieved through implementation of multiple low-cost sensors. Robot's real-time control algorithms will be developed to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under-canopy field environments.

The key strategy to combat growth in the infection rate is through ""social distancing,"" maintaining physical separation from others. This strategy is incompatible with transit systems and ridership in nearly every transit market has plunged, causing agencies to reduce service levels to protect riders and employees. Still, mobility is required in many cities and the ability of cities to rapidly recover from widespread economic shutdown will require improving mobility systems in urban areas. In the past decade, more diverse shared mobility systems have proliferated, potentially improving the resilience and redundancy of the urban transportation system. Most recently, micromobility systems (i.e., bike share and scooter share) have entered cities and supplemented transportation systems in those areas. As a shared personal mobility vehicle, micromobility vehicles have been highly utilized in some markets in the early weeks of the pandemic even as transit ridership has declined. This is an important opportunity to understand how shared micromobility systems complement transit and can support social distancing to limit spread of disease while also facilitating urban transportation recovery. To that end, this study has two main aims. First, the research team will conduct a series of panel surveys for the duration of the pandemic of transit and micromobility users in two medium-sized transportation markets (Nashville and Portland) that have robust micromobility markets. These surveys will query and model mode choice behavior in relation to social distancing requirements, transit captivity, job status, income, activity restrictions, and others. The research team seeks to understand if riders self-regulate transit use and exposure and balance their behavior with perceived risks. The team will use detailed agency and micromobility operator data to track changes in ridership during recovery. The second aim is to project those findings on more aggregate ridership data of transit and micromobility across cities of different sizes and with different COVID-19 infection rates. This will provide detailed understanding of how riders react to pandemic in regard to two main shared modes; transit and micromobility systems. <br/><br/>To date there has been little work on the response of transit to disease outbreaks. The 2002/2003 SARS outbreak provides some aggregate evidence of long-duration drops in transit ridership. This work will provide important insight into disaggregate rider behavior, disease transmission, and personal- and community-risk tolerance. Moreover, this work will explore how emergent modes, like shared micromobility provide opportunities to maintain mobility while reducing close personal contact. Models developed can help predict how city transit systems will recover after a public health crisis. Public health emergencies will continue into the future and preparation on how to react to such emergencies will be important. For example, micromobility systems may provide much needed transportation services to supplement limited transit service. Understanding the dual roles of micromobility and transit will assist in limiting disease transmission and recovering the transportation system. Policy responses could be based on evidence generated in this study for the current and future infectious disease pandemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

COVID-19, which emerged out of the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 is now spreading in multiple countries. It is particularly concerning that the case fatality rate appears to be higher for the novel coronavirus than for seasonal influenza, and especially so for older populations and those with prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Any plan for stopping the epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Different data collection and testing modalities and strategies available to help calibrate transmission models and predict the spread/severity of a disease, have variable costs, response times, and accuracies. In this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project, the team will examine the problem of establishing optimal practices for rapid testing for the novel coronavirus. The result will be the Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM), which will translate into science-based predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic's characteristics, including the duration and overall size, and help the global efforts to combat the disease. The RTEM will fill an important gap in data-driven decision making during the COVID-19 epidemic and, thus, will enable services with significant national economic and health impact. The educational impact of the project will be on mentoring of post-doctoral and PhD researchers and on curricula by incorporating research challenges and outcomes into existing undergraduate and graduate classes. <br/><br/>Computational models for the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and data- and model-driven computer simulations for disease spreading are increasingly critical in predicting geo-temporal evolution of epidemics as well as designing, activating, and adapting practices for controlling epidemics. In this project, the researchers tackle a Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM) problem: Given a partially known target disease model and a set of testing modalities (from surveys to surveillance testing at known disease hotspots), with varying costs, accuracies, and observational delays, what is the best rapid testing strategy that would help recover the underlying disease model? Several scientific questions arise: What is the value of testing? Should only sick people be tested for virus detection? What level of resources should be devoted to the development of highly accurate tests (low false positives, low false negatives)? Is it better to use only one type of test aiming at the best cost/effectiveness trade off, or a non-homogeneous testing policy? Naturally these questions need to be investigated at the interface of epidemiology, computer science, machine learning, mathematical modeling and statistics. As part of the work, the team will develop a model of transmission dynamics and control, tailored to COVID-19 in a way that accommodates diagnostic testing with varying fidelities and delays underlying a rapid testing regimen. The investigators will further integrate the resulting RTEM-SEIR model with EpiDMS and DataStorm for executing continuous coupled simulations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded through the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation program (Engineering).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a vaccine not yet available, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) offer the only way to control the virus at this time. Those interventions, which include social distancing, school closures, and sheltering in place, may be effective if timed appropriately and adopted widely. At the same time, NPIs cause serious social and economic disruption, meaning that they must be used as sparingly as possible. To inform decisions about when to adopt NPIs, and when to relax them, it is important to understand what the consequences of those actions might be. This research will advance the capability of mathematical models to provide insight into those consequences. Looking to past data, the researchers will use statistical approaches to estimate key unknowns, such as numbers of people previously or actively infected. Looking into the future, the researchers will use simulation modeling of communities across the United States to evaluate the consequences of alternative actions. Merging these approaches will capitalize on the strengths of each, resulting in improved projections of the consequences of alternative strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.<br/><br/>This project will feature a geographically realistic, agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States. Advantages of this model include its detailed portrayal of the density, demography, and movement patterns of people in specific counties across the United States, and its ability to directly implement NPIs through behavior modification of agents. These features enable locally tailored projections of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and impacts of NPIs thereon. At the same time, the computational demands of agent-based models pose a challenge to using them in the fast-paced context of a pandemic. To overcome that challenge, the researchers will use less computationally demanding statistical approaches to estimate inputs for use in the agent-based model up to a given point in the pandemic. The agent-based model will then simulate forward from that time under alternative scenarios about use of NPIs. To further safeguard against computational demands being a limiting factor for producing timely results, the researchers will make use of high-performance computing resources to perform batches of simulations of the agent-based model that account for stochasticity and parameter uncertainty. Results will be publicly disseminated on a regular basis over the course of the project, and the researchers will coordinate with stakeholders to ensure that mitigation scenarios under consideration remain relevant as the pandemic progresses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communication of the pathogen occurs directly, from person to person, as well as through cross-contamination from surface to surface. Current forms of personal protective equipment only provide user protection from infection by functioning as a physical barrier. Incorporation of virus-binding polymers and anti-viral nanomaterials with current forms of personal protective equipment can allow the ?capture? and ?killing? of virus species: protecting medical personnel/first responders and subsequently preventing the spread of contagions, such as the novel coronavirus. This RAPID proposal, supported by the nanoscale interaction program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, explores the nano-scale interactions between virus species and medically relevant nanomaterials. The project will utilize bio-compatible polymer nanolayers embedded with local UV light emitting nanoparticles as a model system for the future design of nanomaterial-based anti-viral coatings. Results from this study will demonstrate the efficacy of such nanomaterial platforms towards inactivating harmful viral pathogens as well as elucidate virus-biomedical material interactions. Such valuable information will be disseminated to the public for better design of improved and more effective personal protective equipment in the containment of coronavirus and other pathogens.<br/> <br/>Viral pathogens pose a significant threat to humanity. The COVID-19 pandemic typifies this threat with substantial, crippling impact on the global social structures and economics already felt. Current forms of personal protective equipment function solely as physical barriers to infection/viral transmission (e.g. hospital gowns, medical face masks, gloves, etc.). Ideal personal protective equipment should directly inactivate the virus, upon contact: thereby assuring against user infection as well as preventing cross-contamination through surface to surface contact. In this RAPID project, we propose the design of a multi-layer, bio-compatible nano-polymer coating on personal protective equipment surfaces. These layers will further be seeded with complex oxide nanoparticles which absorb white/natural light and release local UV light to inactivate adsorbed virus agents. Additionally, specific polymers in the coating will be chemically modified with virus surface protein binding oligomeric molecules. The advantage of studying such interaction is twofold: (1) surface proteins are blocked from interacting with host cells (preventing infection) and (2) virus species are retained at the personal protective equipment surface allowing sufficient dosing of nanoparticle-mediated UV light. The combination of anti-viral nanoparticles and virus-selective oligomers will function as a model for future, nanomaterial-based, products effecting a ?capture? and ?kill? approach. Specifically, this interdisciplinary study between engineering and biomedical sciences will highlight nanoscale binding interactions (oligomer-protein, polymer-virus membrane) and the efficacy of nano-emitters in anti-viral platforms. The data collected will educate and inform the general public on diverse, relevant subjects; including outreach to various audiences.

A key public health challenge is the immediate reduction in host-to-host transmission events, particularly in front-line healthcare workers taking direct care of COVID-19 patients. Such patients often have to undergo medical procedures that induce respiratory emissions and thereby put healthcare workers at risk. This RAPID project aims to reduce the host-to-host transmission of COVID-19 during such ?aerosol? emission-producing medical procedures by developing, testing, and deploying fluid-dynamics-based solutions at the patient?s bedside that can essentially syphon off the emissions coming from a patient and protect healthcare workers and other personnel.<br/><br/>This RAPID project seeks to develop such non-pharmacologic containment approaches by first visualizing and quantifying the multiphase nature of respiratory emissions during exhalations, coughs, and aerosol-generating medical procedures pertinent to COVID-19 patients. Based on that quantification, the project will model and quantify the impact of locally applied multiphase flow control for containing, diverting, and collecting the pathogen-laden emissions from the patient and thus reduce exposure to healthcare providers. Finally, the project will develop rapid prototype systems for deployment at the patient?s bedside in clinically relevant settings. The benefits of the project to healthcare professionals and the public rest with the rapid development of concrete and actionable non-pharmacological interventions to curb host-to-host transmission of respiratory infectious diseases and in particular protection of healthcare workers at the frontline of this historic pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The modeling component is particularly important for situations where field work is too hazardous or inaccessible and where it would take too many experiments to fully describe the processes leading to a catastrophic volcanic eruption. This work focuses on continuing development of a flexible, powerful, and easy-to-use package of modeling software used by hundreds of Earth scientists. The alphaMELTS 2 software can model complex scenarios with changing pressure, temperature, and chemical composition while monitoring energy and mass of major and trace elements and gaseous species. This project will increase the mineral systems alphaMELTS 2 can model, support users, extend applications of the software in teaching and training, and facilitate outreach workshops to train new users. These workshops will reach several dozen users, mostly early-career scientists, and equip them with quantitative tools for modern petrology research.<br/><br/>There are several particular advances on which this effort will focus, mostly new thermodynamic model calibrations for use with alphaMELTS 2 and related tools: modeling of CO2 in mantle magmatic systems; the amphibole mineral group; the biotite mineral group; more flexible treatment of trace elements; better integration with MATLAB, Python, and other development environments; and user interaction and training through the online forum and dedicated training workshops. Extension of the calibration strategy to exploit new categories of experiments such as two-liquid equilibria, will allow the pMELTS code for high-pressure melting to describe carbon-bearing systems such as subducted carbonate or upwelling carbonated mantle rocks. The most widespread and important igneous minerals that are not well-modeled in current generations of MELTS are amphibole and biotite; a new strategy will be implemented that can tackle the great complexity of naturally occurring amphiboles and make an accurate yet tractable calibration. Dynamically loadable libraries that allow for seamless incorporation of all alphaMELTS 2 functionality into any Fortran, C++, Matlab or Python code will enable coupling with other codes and flexible scripting. Finally, a large expansion of the phases and trace elements that can be treated with variable and modular partition coefficients will allow users to customize their trace element calculations for greater accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Any viruses released in small sea spray droplets can remain airborne for hours, and recent research has demonstrated that the aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain infectious for up to 3 hours. Thus residents in nearby regions could be exposed to the virus through this unanticipated atmospheric pathway.<br/><br/>Airborne samples will be collected near the US-Mexican border where millions of gallons of untreated sewage from the Tijuana River have been flowing into the ocean continuously for the last 5 months. The samples will be tested for the presence of  SARS-CoV-2 by the RTqPCR laboratory technique, and subject to metagenomic and metatranscriptomic DNA and RNA sequencing. The data will be visualized using a map created in collaboration with the UC San Diego WIFIRE team showing the locations in which SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses and bacteria are detected in air samples, providing critical unprecedented information on the spatial distribution of the airborne microbiome. The plan is for the air samples to be collected before and after COVID-19 becomes widespread in Tijuana, the source region of the raw sewage. This will enable the researchers to examine the relationship between the airborne distribution of SARS-CoV-2 and the distribution of confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases. This project will help to answer questions such as: Which strains of viruses, bacteria, and other sewage-related pollutants are released in sea spray aerosol in a coastal environment? How do ocean concentrations of enteric viruses and bacteria and conditions (swell, flow, wind speed) affect airborne concentrations?

In addition, for drones to function as robots, they need to be made fully autonomous and minimize the need for human operation or intervention.  These attributes are not possible with conventional drone technology today.  The ability to use drones as aerial robots can open opportunities in applications, such as warehouse inventory scanning, construction, security, and factory automation.

Dealing with this data avalanche poses a special challenge for research that probes the structure and function of brain circuits and systems with techniques such as large scale high resolution light microscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and high density recording of brain electrical activity. The aim of this collaborative project between the University of California San Diego and Yale University is to catalyze such research by enhancing the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG), an existing cyberinfrastructure resource that was originally developed to facilitate projects that need High Performance Computing, such as large scale computational modeling of brain circuits. The current project will enhance NSG by incorporating innovations in high throughput computing (HTC) and data management that are required for research involving large amounts of data, implemented in ways that reduce or eliminate the technical and administrative challenges faced by scientists who need to deal with such data. In addition to enabling data-intensive neuroscience research, these new capabilities will increase NSG's utility in education, where it is already widely used in neuroscience and biology instruction at the undergraduate level and higher. Webinars, workshops, and training classes at various conferences will be presented to students and researchers to learn about NSG's new capabilities. This project will increase NSG's scientific and social value as an open and free resource that democratizes participation in science by enabling access to computing and data resources for students and researchers at all academic institutions. <br/><br/>This project adds HTC features to NSG that have been judged most suitable to meet the large scale computing needs for neuroscience data processing, based on actual and projected use cases provided by neuroscientists engaged in data-intensive research. It incorporates commercial cloud computing and Open Science Grid (OSG) resources, integrating them with NSG?s ability to submit appropriate compute workloads to these HTC resources while maintaining the ease of use features of NSG that allow users to seamlessly exploit these compute resources,. Many of the tools that utilize HTC computing mode are made available via NSG to allow processing of input data and retrieval of output results within the existing web based and programmatic user environment of NSG. Flexibility is also provided for users to directly use containerized images of neuroscience modeling and data processing tools on commercial cloud computing resources. Integration of OSG?s data federation capability allows processing of publicly available large neuroscience data which can be distributed in a scalable manner to HTC resources. Incorporation of various data functionalities such as the ability to transfer large data directly to NSG?s storage, share data among NSG users, access and process data by multiple NSG users, enable researchers to perform a wide diversity of data-driven neuroscience research be it processing of electrophysiological (electroencephalography i.e. EEG, magnetoencephalography i.e. MEG), imaging (fMRI) or behavioral (reaction time, test accuracy) data, correlational analysis of multimodal data, or application of machine/deep learning.

To follow such recommendations, people in turn need to trust that government and public health officials are providing good advice. They also need to trust that their fellow citizens will practice the protective behaviors too. Unfortunately, the spread of COVID-19 makes it difficult to trust others because other people are the source of illness. This project aims to understand how people can use their closest personal relationships as a resource in helping them to trust more in other people and in government and public health officials. Understanding how close relationships can be used as a resource in coping with COVID-19 can help identify simple techniques to bolster trust in others and ultimately motivate people to engage in recommended self-protective behaviors.<br/><br/>This project centers on the idea that motivating people to trust more in their closest interpersonal partners can also make them more trusting of their fellow citizens and government and public health officials. Trusting in a close partner should have this effect because such trust should make it seem safer and less risky to depend on other people as well. Past research in this area has focused on how partners and family members influence one another.  This project seeks to expand this knowledge by considering that relationships might succeed or fail as a consequence of the ways in which people?s lives are intertwined with the actions of those in the collective relational world.  The project therefore offers an opportunity to fundamentally transform basic understanding of close relationship dynamics by studying relationships as part of an interconnected system of relationships within the national and global community. A 3-week intervention study examines the effects of a trust-bolstering intervention.  Daily experiences are collected each day, focusing on participant?s concerns about COVID-19, trust in others, and self-protective behavior. This project offers a formal test of how trusting a partner can make the world itself seem more trustworthy and motivate people to engage in the kinds of behaviors needed to stop the spread of illness. Understanding the role that close personal relationships play in shaping people?s responses to the world around them can help promote the kind of trust and cooperation needed for people to rise to global challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nowadays, climate causality study faces many computing challenges, such as processing very large and high-dimensional datasets, and the complexity of modern computing resources.  To tackle these challenges, this project targets novel causality discovery algorithms and related scalable computing techniques. The project is expected to greatly aid Earth System scientists and climate scientists to explore new hypotheses and use cases related to climate causality. The project includes an integrated program of research, education and outreach to help better understand and evaluate climate simulation, fostering workforce development for a multidisciplinary research community on ""Data + Computing + Climate Science"", and raising interest in both IT technology and climate studies among K-12 students, and various underrepresented groups. The project thus serves the national interest, as stated in NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science and advancing national prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to study efficient and reproducible causality analytics for large-scale climate data, so that climate scientists can easily test their causal hypotheses, reproduce existing studies and compare different causality analytics results. To handle the increasing dimensionality and resolution of spatiotemporal climate datasets, the project will study incremental causality discovery algorithms for large-scale climate datasets and parallel causality discovery for spatiotemporal climate data. To address the variety of both causal discovery algorithms and climate simulation/observation datasets, the project will study how to effectively measure climate causality results from different causality algorithms and different climate datasets, and integrate causality results through ensemble techniques. To cope with difficulties in conducting and reproducing causality analytics with large-scale climate datasets, the project will study cloud computing for big data climate analytics pipeline construction and execution optimization. The project will be evaluated from two perspectives. From the computing perspective, the research will be evaluated in terms of algorithm computation complexity, algorithm accuracy and algorithm scalability.

The tools of statistical mechanics and linear response theory are well suited to understand the equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of such phases. This general approach has yielded the most important paradigms and technological breakthroughs in condensed-matter physics of the past century. On the other hand, far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body physics is a frontier in modern physics, and the search for novel paradigms and novel dynamic phases of matter is open and very active. Turbulent states - far-from-equilibrium dynamic states of fields characterized by spatio-temporal chaos - are arguably the least understood of the family of non-equilibrium many-body states. The central scientific goal of this project is to develop the nascent field of matter-wave turbulence as a framework to understand such states and generic far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics problems. Matter waves of ultracold atoms trapped and controlled in programmable optical potentials offer a near ideal platform for this work. Because quantum technologies are playing an increasingly important role in today?s society, the educational component of this project aims at exposing a broader audience to quantum physics, through lectures series, hands-on workshop and more advanced experiments. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>Far-from-equilibrium dynamics of both classical and quantum fields almost inevitably leads to turbulent phenomena. However, to date turbulence and quantum dynamics are mostly investigated by separate scientific communities. Given the ubiquity of hydrodynamics as an effective theory to describe the long-distance long-time behavior of quantum many-body systems, these topics are bound to intersect more often in the future. This project aims at providing a bridge between these two important themes by developing the field of matter-wave turbulence. The project consists of a web of scientific issues that include the observation of a novel form of condensation formed from the far-from-equilibrium particle flow of an inverse turbulent cascade, the study of quantum effects as source of dissipation in wave-turbulent cascades, and the investigation of the existence of threshold effects in wave turbulence. The experimental platforms for this project are bosonic and fermionic atomic superfluids; new forms of forcing, dissipation and probing of these fluids will be performed by leveraging recent technical advances in the shaping of arbitrary potentials on atoms using programmable electro-optic devices. This work likely provides blueprints to tackle other quantum dynamics problems because the generic picture of wave turbulence as a cascade of excitations could be relevant to the elementary excitations of various quantum many-body systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the pre-contact Americas, tuberculosis (TB) infection was caused by a strain that is found today in seals and sea lions. This doctoral dissertation project investigates how a zoonotic strain of TB adapted to humans as a primary host and spread across the Americas. Throughout the project, undergraduate students at Arizona State University will be trained in genomic lab work and analysis, and the resulting datasets will be used to create undergraduate-level workshops. The research team will demonstrate an equitable international collaboration by fostering mutual understanding and inclusivity among affiliated parties, thereby facilitating long-term, innovative, and productive relationships between institutions.<br/><br/>The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) refers to a group of similar pathogens that cause TB infection in humans and animals. Genomes extracted from archaeological remains show that zoonotic lineages were responsible for human TB infections in the past. Most TB infections in humans today, however, are caused by M. tuberculosis, the human-adapted MTBC lineage. The evolutionary steps of an animal-adapted pathogen becoming a human-adapted pathogen are not entirely understood. The researchers will draw comparisons between modern and ancient MTBC genomes to understand better how zoonotic lineages of TB adapt to humans as primary hosts. Ancient MTBC genomes will be extracted from archaeological skeletons. The research team focuses on a densely populated city and trade epicenter to determine the breadth of genomic diversity of ancient circulating MTBC strains, some of which were likely imported through long-distance trade. As human populations expand and the interface between humans and wildlife narrows, understanding the genomic underpinnings of zoonotic transmission dynamics will inform public health surveillance measures. The results of these comparisons will help frame future epidemiological, evolutionary biology, and infectious disease research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers hypothesize that these failures to change attitude and behavior stem from three factors: failures to realize the impact that this disease has, failures to realize how quickly it will be transmitted, and failures to appreciate the dire consequences it will have on the health care system. In this study, the researcher will examine factors underlying these failures and ways to improve delivery of information relevant to COVID-19.

Some tropical places are called ""hotspots"" because their local biodiversity greatly exceeds the biodiversity of other regions with similar climates. Madagascar is such a special place, with a tremendous number of species occurring only on this island, distributed within very small geographic areas. Part of the explanation of Madagascar's rich biodiversity is geographic isolation: long isolation from other landmasses has produced unique species across an island with high topographical and ecological diversity. But why do so many of Madagascar's unique species seem to occupy the same ecological role and yet occur side by side? This research will use ant diversity information from Madagascar to understand the processes that drive distribution patterns and organize insect communities. The results will provide insights into how species diversity patterns evolve, enabling us to both decipher the past and allow us to adapt to the future and respond to threats such as deforestation and habitat loss. This scientific study is accompanied by an extensive education plan integrating undergraduate students into a field research and outreach program to raise awareness on forest conservation issues both in Madagascar and the United States, and teach the skills necessary to monitor and conserve forests.<br/><br/>To investigate community structure and diversity patterns, as well as potential drivers of community assembly and species endemism, this study will utilize new phylogenomic tools and an unparalleled ecological data set for ants in Madagascar based on field inventories and collections conducted across the region by the researchers over the last 20 years. The objectives are to: (1) Assemble a phylogenomic data set of ultraconserved elements from nearly 1,300 species of Malagasy ants. (2) Combine over 100,000 curated specimen records with climatic niche data to model species distributions for all Malagasy ants at 260 study sites. (3) Analyze and characterize patterns of ant community structure and diversity in Madagascar based on these genetic lineage and community data sets. In particular, the vertical stratification of ant communities in the canopy and leaf litter, as well as diversity along elevational gradients, will be examined. This large-scale community analysis aims to understand factors important in generating and maintaining species distribution patterns and endemism, and will allow us to draw widely applicable conclusions about the role of these patterns in community assembly. Beyond expanding the boundaries of scientific discovery, this research will (4) communicate arthropod, rainforest, and canopy biodiversity by educating public and scientific audiences through internships, workshops, video exhibits, and talks, and create extensive training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

It has been well known that the topology and evolution of Sun's magnetic fields are determining factors in providing energy storage and initiation for solar eruptions.  Although magnetic instabilities, such as torus and kink, are known to be related to onset of solar flares, it is still unclear how flare initiation is related to non-force-freeness and certain evolving structures of photospheric magnetic fields.  These include small-scale magnetic reconnections, which are also signified by pre-flare brightenings.  The use of state-of-the-art observations from the 1.6-m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), plus advanced magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) modeling tools and analysis techniques for the extrapolation of coronal magnetic field of the Sun matured significantly in recent years.  <br/><br/>The main purpose of this 3-year collaborative project is to expand the frontiers of existing knowledge on the magnetic energy release process occurring during solar flares.  The research outcome of this project is expected to contribute to the scientific preparation for the future high-resolution solar flare studies, as well as the development of data analysis tools for the DKIST.  The research project addresses some key science questions related to solar flares, namely: the non-force-free properties of solar atmosphere prior to eruptions, and the role of small-scale magnetic reconnections in the initiation of solar flares.  Studying flare-associated magnetic field evolution promises to reveal the underlying physical mechanism of solar eruptions, which are the physical drivers of space weather at the Sun.  Furthermore, this collaborative project has a strong educational and student training component.  It will support two post-doctoral researchers: one at the NJIT and the other at the UAH, and a PhD student at the UAH.  The NJIT will play a key role in training graduate students and young researchers to be the future users of the DKIST.  The data analysis and imaging processing tools can be used by many other areas of science and engineering.  Both the  NJIT and UAH have a very diverse student population.  The project will advance the education of underrepresented students in both institutions.<br/><br/>The team will conduct a comprehensive study of solar flares in order to achieve a fundamental physical understanding of the aforementioned flare-related magnetic field evolution.  The study will combine vector magnetograms from HMI, the spectropolarimeter of Hinode, and the high-resolution, high-cadence vector magnetograms from the GST.  The high-resolution observations are necessary as they can reveal the fine details of dynamic magnetic field structures around flaring sites.  The non-force-free properties of Sun's Active Regions (ARs) near the photosphere become even more prominent under these high-resolution observations.  Three complementary sets of existing vector magnetograph data will be analyzed by the project teams.  The SDO/HMI provides full-disk vector magnetograms with a cadence of about 2 to 12 minutes, which enable the study of the large-scale magnetic field structure and evolution.  The BBSO/GST achieves a high resolution in the order of 0.1"" and a temporal cadence of 30 seconds, thus providing a unique data source for studying the flare core regions in great details.  The Hinode/SP data are obtained at a low cadence, but they cover a rich archive of flares since 2006 and provide a quality check for more recent GST magnetograms.  The project teams will carry out Non-Force-Free Field (NFFF) extrapolations based on combined HMI, Hinode, and GST data and compare them with the more mature Non-Linear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) modeling results.  The NFFF extrapolation will reveal the Lorentz force distribution and evolution of flare productive ARs.  Using extrapolated coronal fields as initial conditions from extrapolations, the teams will apply 3D data-constraint and data-driven MHD modeling to select events.  Using observations, extrapolation, and MHD simulations, the project teams will determine the role of non-force-freeness and evolving magnetic fields in flare initiation and precursor brightening.  As part of the modeling validation, observed flare ribbon motion and the post-flare magnetic restructuring will be compared with the MHD modeling results.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wireless underground sensors that are buried in the soil to provide rich information about soil nutrition will play an important role in precision agriculture. Although they can significantly improve farm yields, wireless underground sensors are costly and hard to maintain since they are deployed in the inaccessible soil medium, which may reduce farmers' profits. This project is expected to radically change the wireless underground sensor network by significantly reducing its cost and complexity. The idea of employing low-cost battery-free wireless sensors with magnetic induction backscatter communications is transformative since these sensors do not require battery replacement and consume negligible energy. The proposed research contributes to a much wider vision of providing ubiquitous connectivity for in-situ sensors in inhomogeneous media such as concrete walls, underwater, and intra-body, which can enable a large number of civilian and military applications. This project also includes a plan to create various educational and research experiences for underrepresented minority students to promote diversity in the workforce.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop adaptable and scalable wireless underground sensor networks using low-cost battery-free sensors with magnetic induction backscatter communications. The ultimate goal is to replace today?s bulky battery-powered wireless sensors with battery-free ones for in-situ sensing applications in inhomogeneous environments. Since the inhomogeneous media destroy existing wireless communication and networking solutions that are based on geometric principles, new theories and algorithms will be developed to overcome this problem and advance our knowledge of wireless network design in complex inhomogeneous environments. This project will develop physical layer solutions for magnetic induction backscatter communications, including channel estimation, blind beamforming, and energy harvesting. A reconfigurable testbed will be built to verify the proposed solutions, upon which channel measurement campaigns will be performed to derive a comprehensive channel model. Soil dynamics can dramatically change network connectivity and throughput. To this end, adaptive network control algorithms based on machine learning will be used to provide ubiquitous coverage, maintain network integrity, and prolong the system?s lifetime. This project will also develop localization algorithms using magnetic induction backscatter communications to track the locations of invisible underground sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these websites are powered by data-driven applications. Such application often consists of two parts: an application hosted on an application server, and a database management system (DBMS) hosted on a separate server from the application server that maintains persistent data. Unfortunately, many data-driven applications suffer from performance problems, such as taking a long time to load a page or inability to scale up to serve large number of clients simultaneously. The state of the art in discovering and fixing performance problems in data-driven applications is to examine the two parts of the application separately, and doing so misses many opportunities in discovering and fixing such problems. Unlike prior approaches, in this project we will treat the DBMS and the application in tandem. In particular, we will devise new techniques and tools to help identify performance problems, understand the cause of such problems, and fix them automatically. This project will open up new opportunities in cross-layer program compilation and optimization, with the practical goal of improving the performance of data-driven applications that will have a significant impact in many aspects of our daily lives.

However, most robots designed for assistive human-robot interaction (HRI) are reactive, either providing ""always on"" assistance or responding only to explicit requests, rather than proactively taking initiative to help with their partner's goal. The next major advance in HRI will involve robots that are able to proactively anticipate and respond to people's needs, just as an experienced caregiver does. To do this, robots must observe and reason about potentially subtle cues of context and human behavior. For example, what someone is looking at can reveal their next action or indicate that they need help with a task. This project investigates how human behavior and context reveal task-relevant mental states, and then develops assistive robots that provide support to people in a variety of everyday situations. In the process of doing the research, this project will also make an educational impact by developing HRI courses and texts that use assistive robotics as an example of effective HRI.<br/><br/>This project will first investigate how human eye gaze can reveal when and how people need assistance in activities of daily living like food preparation and eating. Assistance algorithms will then be developed that monitor eye gaze and proactively respond with robot actions. These algorithms will be evaluated in studies with users who have upper motor impairments and could benefit from the new technology. To these ends, the project contributes: (1) Computational models that use a human's eye gaze and task context to predict task-relevant human mental states such as the target of the current action, the next action to be selected, and whether someone is having difficulty with the task; (2) algorithms that apply mental state models to enable proactive robot assistance in co-manipulation, providing the right type of assistance at the right time; (3) an evaluation of proactive robot assistance algorithms in real-world contexts with users who have motor impairments; (4) a novel ontology of robot assistance types, starting with initial definitions of first- and second-order assistance and expanding outward through literature surveys and interviews; and (5) an extension of shared autonomy algorithms from single-step tasks to multi-step tasks, with a particular focus on ADLs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation research examines the relationships between maternal postpartum depression, culturally relevant social support, and maternal levels of the hormone oxytocin, to better understand the postpartum period from a biocultural perspective. The project will advance fundamental knowledge about maternal dynamics and the biocultural nature of our species. The research may also have broader public health impact by informing culturally appropriate interventions for improving postpartum maternal health.

More than two-thirds of college graduates now carry an average of around $30,000 in student debt when they finish their 4-year degrees. Recently, some experts and stakeholders have discussed various plans to reduce or forgive student loans, and some colleges have begun to implement programs to reduce loans for low-income students. This project examines college students? and graduates? experiences with debt. It examines how students with loans came to take on debt, examining prior experiences with parents, advisors, and peers. It examines student attitudes towards and knowledge about debt, as well as their experiences after college as they begin to pay off that debt. The project also compares their experiences to those who attended a university that implemented a new program to reduce or eliminate student debt, comparing the experiences of those with student loan debt to those who avoided debt either because of this program or without this program. Findings from the project will inform policies in higher education that aim to reduce student loan indebtedness, and provide input for families and political leaders concerned with the implications of student debt for young adults, their families and for United States society generally. <br/><br/><br/>Student loan debt has implications for students, their families and United States society more generally.  Building upon an ongoing longitudinal mixed-methods study, this project will involve conducting interviews with 24 college graduates with loans at two universities who were first interviewed right before their graduation in 2016, and have been interviewed yearly since then.  The project will interview this cohort in both 2020 and 2021. A new cohort of 48 seniors graduating in 2020 will be interviewed at a university that implemented a program to reduce student loans, with interviews right before and 1.5 years after graduation. The ongoing project also included surveys with 3,727 college students at two universities in 2017, as well as 173 graduating seniors from that survey again in 2018. Those graduating seniors will again be surveyed in 2020.  A new survey will be fielded at the university with the student loans program in 2020, with graduates of that university surveyed again in Fall 2021. Instrumental variable regression analyses will be combined with interview data to analyze selection into student loan debt, the different educational experiences of those with and without debt, and sentiments and knowledge about loan debt that may affect events later in young adulthood, including post-graduate experiences and outcomes. This project will help determine the impacts of student loan debt on the transition out of college and into young adulthood, and how student loan debt may represent a new ?class divide? among college graduates that produces differential outcomes later in the life course based on student loan debt status.

The majority of epidemic spread models, however, do not fully consider the tremendous uncertainty associated with human response behaviors (both populations and individual actors) and perturbations in urban system supply chains during an epidemic outbreak. For this project, the research team collects and analyzes time-bound data to better understand and predict and to more effectively respond to the risk of infection disease outbreaks in urban areas. These data can be used to help identify the underlying processes that influence urban-scale population response behaviors, collective sense-making in online social media, disruptions in urban system supply chains, and collective information processing and coordination among actors across different urban sectors. These finding can advance the fundamental understanding of the complexities of epidemic outbreak threats, which would extend beyond standard outbreak models and purely clinical research. The outcomes suggest new ways for better prediction and offer novel insights regarding ways to conduct urban-scale surveillance of epidemic spread risks. The findings inform strategies and possible data-driven tools and methods to prevent, help contain, and mitigate the effects of future epidemics and pandemics.<br/><br/>The specific project tasks are threefold. First, the project will identify and collect data that could provide weak signals about population response behaviors in response to epidemic threats. For example, anomalies in traffic patterns can suggest reduction in demand due to telecommuting. Mobility data, which informs about patterns of population fluxes, facilitates monitoring of the effectiveness of social distancing measures. Second, the project collects social media posts, such those in as Twitter, to examine how epidemic risk is processed and encoded in online social networks. Third, through organizational interviews and surveys, the project uncovers collective information processing and coordination actions among different actors across various urban sectors responding to epidemic spread risks and urban system perturbations. The data are analyzed through spatial modeling, network analysis, and data analytics techniques. In analysis of these datasets, a particular attention are given to population activity patterns in neighborhoods with vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, low income, and racial minorities).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than two-thirds of college graduates now carry an average of around $30,000 in student debt when they finish their 4-year degrees. Recently, some experts and stakeholders have discussed various plans to reduce or forgive student loans, and some colleges have begun to implement programs to reduce loans for low-income students. This project examines college students? and graduates? experiences with debt. It examines how students with loans came to take on debt, examining prior experiences with parents, advisors, and peers. It examines student attitudes towards and knowledge about debt, as well as their experiences after college as they begin to pay off that debt. The project also compares their experiences to those who attended a university that implemented a new program to reduce or eliminate student debt, comparing the experiences of those with student loan debt to those who avoided debt either because of this program or without this program. Findings from the project will inform policies in higher education that aim to reduce student loan indebtedness, and provide input for families and political leaders concerned with the implications of student debt for young adults, their families and for United States society generally. <br/><br/><br/>Student loan debt has implications for students, their families and United States society more generally.  Building upon an ongoing longitudinal mixed-methods study, this project will involve conducting interviews with 24 college graduates with loans at two universities who were first interviewed right before their graduation in 2016, and have been interviewed yearly since then.  The project will interview this cohort in both 2020 and 2021. A new cohort of 48 seniors graduating in 2020 will be interviewed at a university that implemented a program to reduce student loans, with interviews right before and 1.5 years after graduation. The ongoing project also included surveys with 3,727 college students at two universities in 2017, as well as 173 graduating seniors from that survey again in 2018. Those graduating seniors will again be surveyed in 2020.  A new survey will be fielded at the university with the student loans program in 2020, with graduates of that university surveyed again in Fall 2021. Instrumental variable regression analyses will be combined with interview data to analyze selection into student loan debt, the different educational experiences of those with and without debt, and sentiments and knowledge about loan debt that may affect events later in young adulthood, including post-graduate experiences and outcomes. This project will help determine the impacts of student loan debt on the transition out of college and into young adulthood, and how student loan debt may represent a new ?class divide? among college graduates that produces differential outcomes later in the life course based on student loan debt status.  Findings will inform sociological theories of education, family formation, and transition to adulthood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This behavior is explained in part by the endurance capabilities of human skeletal muscle, which, in comparison to chimpanzees, are better suited for holding bodies upright and being active for prolonged periods without fatiguing. However, it is unknown how this property of human skeletal muscle evolved due to its absence from the fossil record and a limited understanding of muscle fiber development at the genetic level. This doctoral dissertation project will identify the genetic switches controlling muscle fiber development using a suite of cutting-edge molecular methods. In doing so, this research will add novel information about the complex genetic landscape underlying muscle fiber development and illuminate the evolutionary history of a unique human trait that may have played a key role in bipedal evolution. This project will support graduate training in advanced molecular methods and bioinformatics. Additionally, the researcher will share their findings with the public by hosting a ?science run? outreach event. Finally, data generated from this research will help characterize muscle biology at the genetic level and therefore has the potential to help target more efficient treatments for a range of neuromuscular diseases.<br/><br/>Understanding when, why and how the transition to bipedalism occurred over the course of human evolution is a fundamental question in biological anthropology. As a species, humans are characterized by a suite of well-described anatomical adaptations that support efficient, long-distance bipedal locomotion. While many of these traits are observable in the fossil record (e.g., bone morphology), others (e.g., properties of skeletal muscle) are more difficult to detect. The high proportion of fatigue-resistant slow-twitch muscle fibers in human hind limb muscles optimizes them to perform tonic, endurance-based activities, and suggests that this trait helps enable long-distance bipedal locomotion. Yet, the genetic mechanisms controlling this trait are not well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, this project will identify the genetic mechanisms underlying muscle fiber development and reconstruct the evolutionary history of these mechanisms across primates. The central hypothesis of this research is that natural selection has selected for human-specific variation in regions of the genome that influence muscle fiber type, increasing the amount of slow-twitch fibers in human hind limb skeletal muscles and the efficiency of bipedal locomotion. To test this hypothesis, the researcher will first use a tailored ATACseq approach to identify those parts of the genome that are active in mammalian muscle tissues and associated with muscle fiber type. Next, they will test the function of a subset of these regions with human-specific variation. In doing so, this project will enrich anthropological understandings of human evolution by identifying regions of the human genome that have shaped the biology of a trait highly relevant to bipedalism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project proposes to have direct and long-term impacts on the growing national need for highly-trained cybersecurity professionals with data analytics capabilities, by increasing the number and quality of cybersecurity analysts. This project aims to develop instructional materials that cater to a wide-range of student learning styles. The materials will be designed so that educators at a wide-range of institutions (e.g., community college to research-intensive institutions), and with varying levels of cybersecurity knowledge, can easily incorporate them into their instruction.<br/><br/>The proposed project seeks to develop a set of instructional modules and hands-on labs that make use of state-of-the-art data analytics for addressing different cybersecurity challenges. These instructional modules will follow active learning principles designed to engage students, regardless of learning style, and ensure that students retain the content learned. The modules will be based on real-world security systems and will be designed to systematically cover fundamental security principles. This approach will allow students to get exposure to data analytics techniques and their application to cybersecurity challenges via real-world examples. The project aims to produce engaging materials that could be easily adopted by other educators. To simplify integration and encourage adoption, the hands-on labs will be built based on only open source software and tools that are free to use for educational purposes. Further, they will be distributed via virtual machine images that already contain all libraries and required software to run the labs.

It has been well known that the topology and evolution of Sun's magnetic fields are determining factors in providing energy storage and initiation for solar eruptions.  Although magnetic instabilities, such as torus and kink, are known to be related to onset of solar flares, it is still unclear how flare initiation is related to non-force-freeness and certain evolving structures of photospheric magnetic fields.  These include small-scale magnetic reconnections, which are also signified by pre-flare brightenings.  The use of state-of-the-art observations from the 1.6-m Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), plus advanced magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) modeling tools and analysis techniques for the extrapolation of coronal magnetic field of the Sun matured significantly in recent years.  <br/><br/>The main purpose of this 3-year collaborative project is to expand the frontiers of existing knowledge on the magnetic energy release process occurring during solar flares.  The research outcome of this project is expected to contribute to the scientific preparation for the future high-resolution solar flare studies, as well as the development of data analysis tools for the DKIST.  The research project addresses some key science questions related to solar flares, namely: the non-force-free properties of solar atmosphere prior to eruptions, and the role of small-scale magnetic reconnections in the initiation of solar flares.  Studying flare-associated magnetic field evolution promises to reveal the underlying physical mechanism of solar eruptions, which are the physical drivers of space weather at the Sun.  Furthermore, this collaborative project has a strong educational and student training component.  It will support two post-doctoral researchers: one at the NJIT and the other at the UAH, and a PhD student at the UAH.  The NJIT will play a key role in training graduate students and young researchers to be the future users of the DKIST.  The data analysis and imaging processing tools can be used by many other areas of science and engineering.  Both the  NJIT and UAH have a very diverse student population.  The project will advance the education of underrepresented students in both institutions.<br/><br/>The team will conduct a comprehensive study of solar flares in order to achieve a fundamental physical understanding of the aforementioned flare-related magnetic field evolution.  The study will combine vector magnetograms from HMI, the spectropolarimeter of Hinode, and the high-resolution, high-cadence vector magnetograms from the GST.  The high-resolution observations are necessary as they can reveal the fine details of dynamic magnetic field structures around flaring sites.  The non-force-free properties of Sun's Active Regions (ARs) near the photosphere become even more prominent under these high-resolution observations.  Three complementary sets of existing vector magnetograph data will be analyzed by the project teams.  The SDO/HMI provides full-disk vector magnetograms with a cadence of about 2 to 12 minutes, which enable the study of the large-scale magnetic field structure and evolution.  The BBSO/GST achieves a high resolution in the order of 0.1"" and a temporal cadence of 30 seconds, thus providing a unique data source for studying the flare core regions in great details.  The Hinode/SP data are obtained at a low cadence, but they cover a rich archive of flares since 2006 and provide a quality check for more recent GST magnetograms.  The project teams will carry out Non-Force-Free Field (NFFF) extrapolations based on combined HMI, Hinode, and GST data and compare them with the more mature Non-Linear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) modeling results.  The NFFF extrapolation will reveal the Lorentz force distribution and evolution of flare productive ARs.  Using extrapolated coronal fields as initial conditions from extrapolations, the teams will apply 3D data-constraint and data-driven MHD modeling to select events.  Using observations, extrapolation, and MHD simulations, the project teams will determine the role of non-force-freeness and evolving magnetic fields in flare initiation and precursor brightening.  As part of the modeling validation, observed flare ribbon motion and the post-flare magnetic restructuring will be compared with the MHD modeling results.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This holds true for the telegraph, the telephone, and typical video conference systems. Meetings for larger groups of people are usually conducted using the same personal interfaces ? take, for example, a telephone conference call. This practice contrasts with a traditional group meeting, for example, or a classroom scenario. In the latter, students and teachers can communicate with each other while having an awareness of the spatial location of each participant and the ability to identify each speaker easily. The goal of this project is to develop technology that enables two distant classrooms to be joined by telecommunication devices without the need for personal communication interfaces. An electronically adjustable microphone array will be designed that can virtually focus on an active speaker. This way, echoes that would otherwise occur in a collaborative telecommunication scenario with loudspeakers will be avoided. The system will be designed such that the sounds of a speaker will emanate from the position at which they are seen on a live video feed. Project outcomes are expected to have broad impact by providing new educational opportunities for classroom students by virtually connecting them to other classrooms for collaborative learning experiences.  <br/> <br/>This project will develop a spatially correct, long-distance audio connection between collaborative spaces, for example two classrooms with groups of people at each site. The missing link needed to enable such remote collaboration is an audio tracking system that can follow all participants on both sides of the connection. The approach will use two 16-channel spherical microphones as the main audio tracking devices. The key idea is that each spherical microphone will receive continuous information from additional body-worn microphones, which is utilized to ensure echo-free bidirectional communication. The body-worn microphone signals will inform the tracking system who among the participants is speaking at a given time interval and in a given frequency range. The spherical microphone is then used to track each sound source during the time intervals that the source is active and in those frequency bands that are not disturbed by other sources. Using machine-learning tools, including Bayesian methods, Kalman filters, and Deep Neural Networks, the tracking system will implement a joint bottom-up/top-down architecture. Two existing sites are equipped with immersive loudspeaker systems, each of which will enable accurate local reproduction of spatialized audio from the remote site. These sites are also equipped with collaborative virtual reality systems with immersive video capabilities, and they will serve as laboratories for this project, enabling a system to transmit bidirectional audio/video streams with spatially congruent audio/video images. As an extensions of the project, the audio-tracking system will be paired with an existing 6-camera tracking system that is mounted on the laboratory ceiling and technologies will be developed to replace the body-worn microphones with virtual microphones using the beam-forming capabilities of a spherical microphone array.  In another extension, visual gestures of participants will be considered to further facilitate the telematic experience. An important component of this research will be the development of an affordable and deployable version of the collaborative virtual reality system that can be easily used in schools, for example as a ceiling-mounted system hosted in a school's gymnasium.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Performing such specialization requires labor intensive, complex, and error prone efforts. The intellectual merits of this project are to advance the state of the art in application-specific DBMS design by investigating techniques to perform such domain specialization automatically. As part of this project's broader impacts, the lessons and techniques learned will be integrated into programming languages and classes that the PI routinely teaches.<br/><br/>Specifically, this proposal aims to leverage recent advances in programming systems and data management research to build tools that can automatically understand database application semantics. Given such knowledge, the goals of this project are to 1) create tools that can automatically optimize the specific set of queries that can potentially be issued by the application, and prove that the optimized queries are semantically equivalent to the inputs; 2) investigate techniques to automatically select the optimal framework (in terms of execution time, resources required, etc) to execute the queries issued by the application, and 3) devise new languages for programmers to express their data consistency needs when queries are to be executed across a distributed set of nodes, and build an implementation of such languages. All software artifacts developed in this project are released to the public, with plans to incorporate their usage in both the undergraduate and graduate curricula. In addition, as part of the project is to collect and study the shortcomings of real-world database applications, the collected applications are collected into a repository that is publicly accessible repository for researchers and practitioners in the field to experiment and reproduce the results."

This invitation-only three-day meeting will be to be jointly convened by the National Science Foundation Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).  It is increasingly apparent that many of the systems on which our society depends for its health, prosperity, and security are neither purely social nor purely technical ones. Rather, they are socio-technical systems. For example workplace relationships, media markets, health delivery systems, and criminal justice organizations are all increasingly characterized by a complex mixture of human actors and institutions on the one hand, and digital platforms and algorithms on the other hand. Efforts to design, manage, audit, and ultimately improve these systems to the benefit of society therefore lie at the intersection of the computational sciences and the social-behavioral sciences. <br/><br/>This workshop will bring together experts from nationally recognized institutions comprising a diverse range of stakeholders and perspectives drawn from academia, industry, government, and philanthropy to discuss three core themes at the intersection of the computational and social-behavioral sciences. This intersection has been an area of increasing research interest and innovation in recent years, generating new conferences, funding opportunities, and jobs, both in academia and industry. In order to generate practical solutions to real-world socio-technical problems, however, a number of challenges must be overcome that will require new streams of funding and also new models of collaboration, between the computational and social-behavioral sciences, and also among academia, government and industry. The workshop is organized around three core substantive themes, each of which corresponds to a contemporary societal concern of widespread interest: increasing opportunity for all Americans, while reducing harmful disparities; improving the trustworthiness of the information ecosystem; and empowering the skilled technical workforce<br/><br/>In addition to sketching out a research agenda for each of these substantive areas, the workshop would also focus attention on four cross-cutting challenges: building large-scale, shared data infrastructures for research purposes; partnering with industry around problems of shared interest; fostering collaborations between CISE and SBE researcher; and developing training and educational programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, from a practical perspective, it is often desirable to determine to ""quantify the uncertainty"" of our predictions, i.e., to be able to say how accurate or inaccurate a computer simulation is when the inputs are not exactly known. An example is how an airfoil behaves when the air ahead is turbulent. In these cases, one needs to simulate many scenarios, an exceedingly expensive proposition. This project aims to develop mathematical tools to make this process more feasible and computationally affordable by taking advantage of multilevel hierarchies in the sampling and solution approach.<br/><br/>Many processes in the sciences and engineering are described by parameter-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) whose numerical solution is expensive. While their forward solution may be feasible, the computational cost makes it difficult or impossible to statistically evaluate questions such as (i) to quantify the uncertainty in output variables given a known or assumed distribution of parameter values, or (ii) to solve the statistical inverse problem of inferring a probability distribution among parameters from noisy measurements. Both of these questions are typically answered through high-dimensional and consequently very expensive sampling methods. This project will use hierarchical and multilevel decompositions of PDE solvers, coupled with error estimates, to derive vastly faster methods to obtain a sufficient number of samples to achieve statistical sampling with prescribed accuracy. The approach implies that whenever possible, samples and PDE solutions can happen on coarse, cheap levels of their respective hierarchies, and expensive solves are performed only when necessary. The combined use of these hierarchies therefore promises to deliver more, and more informative, samples at a cheaper cost - thereby enabling applications in the sciences and engineering that were not possible before.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to find new ways to adapt special-purpose hardware for general and multiple ends, using Intel's Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) as a proof of concept. Intel's designers intended MPX to be used to improve software security by ensuring an important property called spatial memory safety. The project investigates many other surprising uses for MPX.<br/><br/>The project explores the idea of viewing special-purpose ""hardware"" as general-purpose hardware-accelerated ""software"". In particular, the project aims to repurpose MPX for three broader uses, beyond its original specialized hardware support for spatial memory safety. First, a technique to transparently augment temporal memory safety on top of MPX will be studied to ensure full memory safety. Second, a novel dynamic program analysis framework, which repurposes the MPX as a general-purpose metadata store, will be designed and developed. Last, the project will investigate the potential of MPX as a general-purpose hardware-accelerated data structure.<br/><br/>The project will impact both current and future researchers, practitioners, and students. The project will unlock the full potential of Intel's special-purpose hardware, explore the limitations of its instruction set architecture, and thus help design next-generation processors powered by more general-purpose features. These next-generation processors will enable more secure, reliable, and performant software. New undergraduate course modules will be developed to integrate research discovery with teaching. A K-12 summer class will be offered as an outreach and diversity program. The project also includes a plan to offer a program analysis workshop for non-computer scientists to support the broader research community.<br/><br/>The project's main results will be software prototypes and hardware simulations, along with benchmarks, documentation, and research papers.

Her approach is to have systems ""process encrypted data'"" instead of plaintext data.  Her research enables organizations to carry out collaborative computation without giving away their data: each organization encrypts the data, shares encrypted data, the collaborative computation (either at the organizations or in a cloud) processes and computes on encrypted data producing an encrypted result that only the organizations can decrypt. The overarching challenge is to support such computation  efficiently and to express rich functionalities, when existing cryptographic methods are too slow. Using the open-source platform the PI is building, she is collaborating with top Canadian banks to detect money laundering in a collaborative way, as well as healthcare organizations to build better medical models.

These systems make cities ?smart? by producing real-time data to manage services efficiently and promote the well-being of residents.  This project extends this model to the courts, legal service providers, and administrative agencies that make up a community?s civil justice system.  These institutions assist residents with legal problems like housing, debt, child custody, and public benefits. But, despite their centrality in people?s lives, they are neither ?smart? nor ?connected.? Currently, data from courts, legal service providers, and administrative agencies are collected in multiple formats and housed among multiple institutions. Access to these data, moreover, is governed by a hodgepodge of statutes, regulations, and rules. As a consequence, researchers and policymakers do not know whether the justice system furthers people?s well-being.  This project investigates what rules and data standards will facilitate the sharing of data by civil justice institutions in a data commons to produce knowledge about how well these institutions serve people and what their long-term effects are on people?s lives.<br/><br/>This project adopts a two-pronged approach to design a civil justice data commons. It will engage with civil justice stakeholders in several communities to understand their interests and concerns. What incentives exist to share data? What privacy concerns arise? The second prong involves engaging with academic data scientists about the technical requirements and best practices for the creation of a viable data commons in the civil justice field, learning from the development of data commons in other areas (e.g., biomedical data science; social survey research).  By developing best practices for data management and sharing among community civil justice institutions, this planning study will encourage state and county courts, legal service providers, government labs, and policy institutes to take steps towards building a civil justice data commons in their communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonetheless, large-scale manufacturing of nanomaterials has lagged, partly because of the inability to efficiently qualify and control nanoscale production methods. The proposed project will develop a user-friendly, practical, and potentially portable chemical imaging system. This technology will revolutionize nanotechnology by improving quality control of future production methods and enabling new applications, ranging from data storage and optical communication to cancer detection. The probe microscope market accounts for approximately 4% of the $5.3 billion microscopy market and has been limited by measurement complexity and lack of chemical sensitivity. The proposed technology would remove these limitations, creating an opportunity for growth within the microscopy market space.<br/><br/>The proposed project is to prototype the transformative nanoscale chemical imaging microscopy by integrating the invented plasmonic fiber probes with commercial probe microscopes. Nanoscale chemical imaging had demonstrated potential for use in an array of applications including material science, bio-sensing, optoelectronics, and catalysis. However, due to the complex operating challenges including optical alignment times, low tip reliability, low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and highly skilled technician requirements, there has been limited commercial application. This PFI-TT project will undertake prototyping activities of a fiber tip-enhanced Raman spectroscope (F-TERS), an optical fiber probe-based nanoscale chemical imaging microscopy designed to overcome these challenges while still providing the chemical composition and nanoscale morphology imaging of a sample surface. In addition, F-TERS also provides the potential for significantly improved SNR, enabling additional applications. This will be accomplished by 1) overcoming the identified hurdles of demonstrating F-TERS functionality with atomic force microscope (AFM), and 2) quantifying F-TERS performance in real-world environments with independent operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is also an ever-increasing trend in the number of wireless devices that is now already over 8.6 billion and is expected to grow to 12.3 billion by 2022. The increasing density of wireless devices with high data rate requirements has caused spectrum crunch in the sub-6GHz bands. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies between 30GHz to 300GHz can alleviate the spectrum scarcity and provide major potentials for future cellular and emerging WiFi networks with Gbps data rates. Current studies have mostly focused on understanding wireless channel impairments and propagation characteristics at high frequencies. While such efforts are essential, there are gaps in developing network protocols tailored for mmWave. This project takes a system-level approach to develop and implement algorithms for reliable mmWave networking with guaranteed end-to-end performance. It also provides great opportunities for curriculum enhancement by introducing new trends and challenges in future wireless networks,  training students from under-represented populations at different levels, and attracting young minds, including high-school students, to the STEM areas via appealing demos of mmWave applications.      <br/><br/>The significant differences between mmWave and sub-6GHz call for a radical rethinking of the design principles across all the layers of the protocol stack.

The proposed research will be conducted across three inter-related thrusts: (1) Low-overhead Beam Alignment for Multi-hop Settings: Leveraging multi-armed bandit (MAB) frameworks, this thrust will develop an efficient beam alignment algorithm that considerably reduces the angular beam search space and overall beam alignment overhead, which is essential for dense mmWave networks with multi-hop topologies; (2) Fault-Tolerant Multi-hop Routing to Combat Blockage: In order to guarantee reliable and robust mmWave communication under blockage, this thrust will resort to network and routing layer solutions to develop an on-demand routing protocol that is able to quickly recover under a link blockage; (3) Optimal Buffer Allocation in Multi-hop Networks: This thrust will investigate the problem of optimal buffer allocation in multi-hop mmWave networks with multi-users.

DOM plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems. Thus, variations in DOM chemical composition may inform understanding of different processes in the environment. Fluorescence has emerged as a common tool to characterize DOM, but many challenges are associated with its use. In this research collaboration between the University of Colorado at Boulder and Montana State University, the connection between fluorescence characterization of DOM and specific chemical constituents within this mixture will be evaluated. The results from this study will impact the field of environmental engineering and aquatic science by providing specific guidelines and education regarding the use of fluorescence as a broad metric for DOM chemical understanding in aquatic ecosystems. <br/> <br/>The characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) by fluorescence spectroscopy has become ubiquitous in the environmental engineering and science communities. Specifically, the use of excitation emission matrices (EEMs) has emerged as one of the most common tools used by researchers examining DOM on numerous natural and engineered processes. Given the amount of data collected in an EEM, several qualitative and quantitative approaches have been developed to analyze the results. In most cases, these approaches attempt to tie a fluorescence response to a chemical constituent or behavior within DOM. The environmental engineering and science community has embraced fluorescence as an important tool for the characterization of DOM. However, little progress has been made in understanding what specific factors (e.g., chemical structures and molecular composition) controls the observed fluorescence response. The main goal of this project is to fill the deficiencies in chemical interpretations of fluorescence information by conducting a detailed evaluation of fluorescence analyses as a broad measure to interpret the chemical composition and variability of DOM. The results from this proposal will offer guidelines to engineers and scientists regarding the use of fluorescence for the characterization of DOM. The use of different commonly used fluorescent interpretation metrics will be calibrated against distinct chemical analyses of DOM samples from highly fluorescing environmental fractions. It is expected that this project will provide the community with detailed guidelines regarding the limitations of the use of fluorescence for DOM research in natural and engineered systems. The educational component will focus on the incorporation of results from this study into collegiate curricula and departmental seminars at the collaborating institutions. Graduate and undergraduate students will be educated in analytical chemistry techniques routinely used for water quality assessments.

AI?s rapid expansion across fields and industries and its dramatic impact on the economy and national security necessitate developing a workforce knowledgeable and capable of working with AI. There is an urgent need to research K-12 students? capacity to learn AI concepts and processes and how best to support their development of AI skills and career interests. Meanwhile, broadening participation in AI is an important need in AI workforce development. Engaging students from underrepresented groups in AI education can help ensure that the design, development, and utilization of AI technologies are inclusive and equitable. The objective of this project is to build field-advancing knowledge about 1) appropriate measurements and instruments to assess middle school students? concept knowledge, awareness of AI and perceptions about AI, and  career orientation; and 2) whether and how students are able to learn key AI concepts and become more interested in AI and related careers. This knowledge will be generated through investigating the learning outcomes and efficacy of an AI curriculum in informal learning contexts with students from diverse backgrounds, including Hispanic/Latinx and African American learners. The project specifically addresses middle school students (ages 11-13) because the middle school years are a critical time for students to begin exploring careers related to their interests. In order to develop a diverse AI workforce, it is important to expose students to the wide range of applicability of AI and the career options it confers. Many of the AI learning activities produced through the project are not dependent on the availability of computers, contributing to multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in AI learning experiences for underserved students who do not have consistent access to Internet services . This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>Researchers will focus on four research questions: 1) What are students? perceptions and attitudes towards AI and how do they change, if at all, as a result of the interventions? 2) What knowledge and skills do students develop through the interventions? 3) What kinds of interactions between youth and curriculum materials, tools, and peers facilitate students? conceptual development? and 4) What connections do students make, if any, between the skills they learn and application of those skills in various STEM and computer science careers and fields? The project team will use a design based research approach in conducting expert reviews, focus groups, and a pilot test to iteratively test and refine the curriculum, measures, and assessments. The team will then conduct an efficacy study to collect and analyze data to generate estimates of the impact of the intervention on youths? perceptions of and attitudes toward AI, learning of concepts in AI, and career adaptability. Additionally, video and interaction analyses, cognitive interviews, and case studies with thematic analyses will be used to gain an understanding of student engagement with the AI activities; student interactions that facilitated learning such as interactions between students and curriculum materials, students and tools, and students and their peers; and the best strategies to support them to pursue AI related careers. The project?s deliverables include: the Developing AI LIteracy (DAILy) curriculum; the Attitudes Toward AI, AI Concept Inventory and AI Career Futures surveys; and the research findings. The project?s outcomes will build the knowledge base on appropriate measurements and instruments, students? learning processes, how and to what extent students can learn AI concepts in middle school, and the efficacy of the intervention with an audience of underrepresented youth. The research has potential to advance the field of AI education by contributing to the definition of AI literacy, forming the basis for subsequent research on learning trajectories in K-12 AI education, and generating understandings that are foundational to developing education programs that will prepare a workforce knowledgeable and capable of working with AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks.

These exchanges occur via atmospheric processes, temporary aquatic connections, natural 'hitchhiking' on other migrating animals, and dispersal by humans. Aquatic systems where these can be studied include Great Plains ephemeral wetlands. These systems, such as playas and prairie potholes, are abundant in grassland ecoregions and support resident invertebrate species, amphibians, and migrating waterfowl. Their ephemeral nature requires residents to periodically seek other aquatic systems or produce resistant eggs that allow them to survive dry periods lasting months to decades. Their 'signature' species are tiny fairy and tadpole shrimps. These lay resistant eggs which can be dispersed by 'wind and wing.' The former includes egg transport by prevailing Great Plains winds, and the latter by eggs hitching rides in the guts of migrating waterfowl to be deposited later in other wetlands. The research will manipulate community composition in outdoor tanks to determine competitive abilities of invertebrates from different sites and to check for migrating branchiopods in the digestive tracts of waterfowl shot by hunters. The project will use this accessible system to develop ecology programs for K-6th grade students; employing young students in science studies; educating under-served student populations, including Native Americans and students from our Hispanic Serving Institution; and working on wetlands-focused conservation.<br/><br/>The research will focus on the question: how do teleconnections (dispersal by wind and wing) and climatic factors influence macroinvertebrate community composition and synchrony (temporal links) in ephemeral ponds within a macrosystem network? This project will test 6 hypotheses on factors shaping community composition that are related to: strong dispersal, geographically variable dispersal, strong climatic synchrony, geographically variable climatic synchrony, equal roles for dispersal and climate, and a null hypothesis on stochasticity. The study will be 25 sites in the greater region, including 5 sites within the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The study will consist of: (1) sampling pond invertebrate densities and diversities; (2) analyzing genetic signatures of branchiopod crustacean populations; (3) conducting tank experiments on community assembly; (4) obtaining data on waterfowl migrating through NEON sites; (5) correlating effects of winds and rainfall on species traits; and (6) extracting, hatching, and identifying crustacean eggs from gut contents analysis of waterfowl. Overall, this research will test the validity of a poorly understood phenomenon, that the biota of systems can be coupled without respect to geographic proximity but instead tele-connected by wind or wing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Ge is developing new methods to construct carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. This reaction chemistry allows for various common organic compounds to be readily accessed in an efficient manner via a C-H bond functionalization process.  It also enables rapid late-stage functionalization (LSF) of complex organic molecules. When compared to conventional cross-coupling reactions, the C-H functionalization process does not require pre-functionalized starting materials and can avoid the use of stoichiometric organometallic reagents, making it more environmentally and economically beneficial. The new type of C-H functionalization reactions allows for the use of readily-available organic molecules as starting materials, and thus improves the potential applications of the process. The principal goal of the project is to develop novel transition metal-catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions in order to provide powerful, valuable, and straightforward synthetic approaches to access common organic frameworks. A variety of medically important (hetero)cyclic skeletons are expected to be efficiently accessed from readily-available aliphatic amines and aldehydes via this strategy. The asymmetric functionalization of these strong sp3 C-H bonds is also designed with the use of chiral catalysts. The project focuses primarily on synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry with potential integration of computational and medicinal chemistry.

Experiments that measure light absorbed and emitted by the crystals are compared to calculations of the various energies of the electrons in the crystal. From these experiments and calculations it is now possible to determine how the vibrations of the molecules affect the electrons that are responsible for the flow of electricity, thus gaining fundamental understanding of the electronic properties of these materials.  The findings of this project help determine the best materials to use to make more efficient and cheaper electronic devices such as displays for flat-screen TVs and other media, photosensors, and solar cells.  Graduate students and undergraduates participating in the project are developing valuable skills in experimentation and computation while contributing to fulfilling a national and global societal need for more efficient and sustainable technology.<br/><br/>Technical description: Organic semiconductors are of significant interest due to their potential for opto-electronic applications such as solar cells and photosensors.  Charge transfer compounds, which are made of two or more different organic molecules in which one species acts as a donor of electric charge and the other as an acceptor, could provide new properties or improved performance to increase the range of application of organic semiconductors. The goals of this project are to elucidate the excited-state dynamics of selected charge transfer compounds and develop a deep understanding of electronic couplings and electron-phonon couplings in them.  Charge transport and excited-state dynamical processes are critical to applications of these materials in opto-electronic devices, and depend on a subtle interplay between electronic and electron-phonon interactions.  Transient absorption and fluorescence lifetime measurements, when interpreted in light of computational evaluation of the rates of various electron-transfer processes, allow the decay mode of excitons in these materials to be determined. Resonant Raman experiments are used to extract relaxation energies and transfer integrals.  These experimental findings are interpreted in light of site energies, electron-phonon and electronic couplings computed using a variety of methods, including density functional theory calculations of large molecular clusters and those based on periodic boundary conditions, semi-empirical approaches, and tight-binding models, and molecular dynamics simulations.  This strongly-coupled series of experimental investigations and theoretical modeling opens a large range of functionalities not manifest in monomolecular solids.

This project brings together these concepts of augmented reality and embodied learning to develop a new innovation: mobile-phone-based augmented reality math activities. This research project investigates these activities in public elementary-schools, where students solve math related challenges, and are encouraged to find mathematics in the real objects of classrooms, gyms and playgrounds. Students carry a cell phone-based intelligent system (or a SmartWatch) that supports them as needed, giving hints and feedback as they play multiplayer team-based mathematics games that require them to measure, estimate, compute, discern and discard objects in their environments, both in their minds and using their bodies. This project advances scientific knowledge on how people learn with active physical activities, investigating the role of hand and full-body motions, as well as the role of team-based cooperation in the mathematics classrooms of our public schools.<br/><br/>This project involves a new genre of Cyberlearning Technologies called Multi-Modal Embodied Intelligent Learning and Tutoring Environments that supports learning through (1) Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which can trace students' knowledge and affect in real time, and personalize instruction through moment-by-moment tracking of students' mental states (i.e. knowledge and affective tracing); and, (2) Embodied Cognition and multi-modal interaction (physically acting on the environment in meaningful ways for more solid understanding and encoding of ideas).

To date, most focus has been placed on biodiversity loss, motivated by documented extinctions of many terrestrial vertebrate species. This focus on species extinctions, however, misses much of the bigger and messier picture of how biodiversity is changing. In many places across the globe, the number of species at a given location has actually been increasing or staying constant, not decreasing - bucking the expected trend. This might be because invasive species or species moving poleward in response to changing temperatures may balance out or outpace local losses. Moreover, species extinctions occurring at regional or continental scales simply may not be well documented in small-scale studies. Furthermore, even if the number of species at a location is not changing, the composition of the ecological community may be unstable. Estuaries (coastal water bodies where fresh and salt waters meet) are places of rapid transformation due to combinations of global environmental change and local factors, such as coastal development. This research will bring together data from government and academic research programs to measure how the biodiversity of estuarine fish communities has changed over the last 70 years across the entire US Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. Fish biodiversity is tightly linked with important ecosystem services like fisheries productivity. It is therefore critical to understand how these environmental changes may alter the biodiversity of estuarine fishes and how expanding warm-water species may reshape coastal fisheries. This project will support one postdoctoral researcher and provide innovative training in statistics, data synthesis, and collaboration.  <br/><br/>The objective of this study is to identify environmental and human drivers of multiple components of estuarine fish biodiversity (alpha, temporal beta, and spatial beta diversity). This project will leverage time-series data sets spanning up to seven decades from 65 coastal embayments ranging from South Texas to Maine to assess biodiversity trends at nested spatial scales (survey site, embayment, eco-region, and continental). Through synthesis of biodiversity data with environmental and land-use data along with multi-scale and hierarchical models, it will be possible to identify hotspots of biodiversity change, important predictors of this change, as well as relevant spatial scales at which effects on biodiversity are evident. The project will also use a newly proposed metric, community mean range limit, to assess whether increases in warm-water species are driving biodiversity change along major range boundaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This rich space of problems has long been studied in economics and mathematics, leading to a slew of striking theoretical results. But real-world applications have been sparse. From the AI viewpoint, the study of computational social choice is seen by many researchers as a central component in the effort to build the foundations of multiagent systems. This research extends this theoretical work in computational social choice to enable people to make joint  decisions. This project aims to put human decision making at the center of computational social choice, while leveraging the very approaches and techniques developed for voting in multiagent systems.  The research plan is directly motivated by the not-for-profit website RoboVote.org, which enables people to implement whichever voting methods appear to be best based on analysis and empirical evidence. This project will realize the full potential of RoboVote for education, outreach, and societal impact with the aim of transforming the way people make group decisions in a wide range of applications.<br/><br/>The specific challenges that will be tackled are divided into two subsets, corresponding to the two fundamentally different types of polls currently modeled on RoboVote.  1. Subjective preferences: Preferences are subjective when the desirability of each alternative is a matter of taste. RoboVote aggregates subjective rankings by assuming that voters have latent utilities for the alternatives, and selecting an outcome that maximizes the sum of utilities by using the reported rankings as a proxy for those utilities. An immediate gap that must be addressed is that the approach does not extend to the case where the outcome is a ranking. A second, far-reaching challenge is to rethink the way voters express their preferences, in order to obtain more useful information regarding their actual utility functions while keeping the cognitive burden low. Finally, the project includes a study of the axiomatic properties of optimal aggregation methods in the foregoing framework.  2. Objective opinions: In this scenario, some alternatives are objectively better than others, but this objective comparison is not known to voters. The solutions deployed on RoboVote aim to handle worst-case noise. The research aims to create and test algorithms that improve upon naïve approaches, especially by building on synergistic advances in the design of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms."

The three labs to be investigated differ in terms of their transnational funding and networks, their standards for evidence-controlled experiments, their verification by the larger scientific community, and their level of commercialization. Instead of analyzing stem cell research through the lens of the nation-state, this project focuses on cultural differences of stem cell science within a nation.

It explores whether and how differences in the mechanics of knowledge production explain the differing epistemological and social responses towards the epistemic things produced at these three laboratories. (2) Investigation of the impact of the shifting market-oriented political culture of science on the three stem cell laboratories. The project, thus, explores: (a) how political culture has impacted the practices of the three laboratories, and (b) whether and how the national and international networks of the laboratories have led to differential impact on the credibility of the scientific practices at those laboratories despite their being located within the same regulatory regime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mechanical integrity of these interfaces is critical for sustaining electrochemical reactions in the battery systems; consequently, it dictates the long-term performance (or durability) of batteries. Fracture of the polymer/active particle interface electrically isolates active particles and is one of the predominant mechanisms by which capacity fade occurs in batteries, yet the mechanics of this interface failure is the least understood problem. Also, the interfaces in batteries are more complex and their properties change continuously. The novel in situ techniques and fracture criterion developed here will be useful in the validation of multi-physics battery models and development of new electrode material designs for emerging battery technologies that can transform automotive, biomedical, aerospace, and military applications where durability is an important requirement. The integrated education plan includes development of a lab module for students at NJIT that demonstrates the process of stress generation (cause of mechanical damage) during electrochemical cycling processes. This module will be modified and adapted into outreach programs for K-12 students and teachers. This award also enables elementary teacher trainees from the Newark school system to participate in the research. <br/><br/>The polymer/active material interface fracture has been a major roadblock for the rapid advancement of next generation battery electrodes such as Si, Sn, Al, and other large volume change materials.

To keep the effort more focused, the interface system in lithium-ion batteries is considered as a model system. A fracture mechanics framework with an interface constitutive model that can incorporate in situ observations, will be developed for prediction of interface failure during an electrochemical reaction. This research will enable interface failure prediction under concurrent mechanical and electrochemical loading using the fracture mechanics models; hence, it lays the groundwork for the essential fundamental understanding to develop long cyclic life, low-cost, and durable batteries for a diverse range of applications."

The work serves to promote our scientific base of understanding of the mechanism of lubrication aiding in the further development of dry lubricants. These lubricants are critical to our national defense and prosperity by impacting the many commercial applications where poor lubrication can lead to wear that limits the machine lifetime and wastes energy. The research will use atom-level tools to understand surface structure of these dry lubricants, with an emphasis on MoS2 which is the most important dry lubricants in use. This lubricant fails in use through the development of defects and a defect structure within the MoS2. To determine the evolution of this defect structure, samples will undergoing controlled wear in the laboratory or will have been exposed to the environment of space on the international space station (ISS) for an extended time. The changes in friction and lubricating properties together with the atomic level structure will be ascertained. This information will generate the basic understanding of the defect formation process aiding in the design of new lubricants and additives with extended lifetime in all environments. The outreach and education features include an integrated research/education plan to increase education, exposure and interest in tribology at all levels of society, with hands-on K-12 outreach activities, curriculum development, and student undergraduate and graduate research experiences.<br/><br/>Experiments, advanced characterization and models will probe the links between structure, processing, properties and tribological performance of MoS2 coatings for extreme environments (including space). The technical program is centered 2 research themes: 1) assess the role of molybdenum disulphide microstructure and composition in preventing chemical and tribological degradation during exposure to oxidative and humid environments; 2) understand the energetics of MoS2 tribology to develop a model of friction based on orientation, commensurability, defect density and crystallite size as a function of temperature, environment and starting/evolving microstructure of tribofilms formed during sliding. MoS2 films of varying microstructure, composition and processing techniques will be systematically tested to develop a mechanistic framework for tribological interactions of MoS2. Experiments include environmental tribological studies looking to the effects of ultrahigh vacuum, humidity, O2, atomic oxygen and temperature extremes through state-of-the-art surface chemical characterization and atomistic molecular dynamics models. Finally, tribological experiments and material samples returned from the international space station will be analyzed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include traffic incidents (Waze), restaurant reviews (Yelp, FourSquare), anonymous social networks (Whisper, Yik Yak), and even dating (Tinder, Bumble).  Unfortunately, new threats can compromise and manipulate these communities, using lightweight software to mimic mobile devices.  The researchers have shown how attackers can eavesdrop on mobile network traffic, learn their patterns, and write software to emulate mobile devices running the application. This amplifies existing attacks by multiple orders of magnitude, and allows attackers with limited resources to overwhelm mobile communities using millions of emulated devices under their control. These devices are difficult to detect, and completely cripple entire mobile systems, or manipulate them for the attacker's personal gain.  Preliminary work showed that such an attack on Waze, Google's crowdsourced traffic navigation application, enabled fine grained GPS-level tracking of large user populations.

These spaces model real world objects and low dimensional topology is highly relevant to other scientific disciplines. For example, knot theory, a branch of low dimensional topology, is an effective tool in studying configurations of protein and DNA. In addition, topology plays an essential role in formulating modern theories in physics. Perhaps more surprisingly, tools from modern physics, more specifically quantum filed theory, have yielded significant progresses in low dimensional topology. This National Science Foundation funded project promotes systematic application of ideas in physics to topology and vice versa.  The PI aims to investigate applications of the Yang-Mills theory of high energy physics in the topological properties of three-and four-dimensional objects. The proposed research also partly focuses on foundational questions in symplectic geometry, a field with close ties with Physics.<br/><br/>Instanton Floer homology, defined using Yang-Mills gauge theory, provides algebraic invariants of three- and four-dimensional manifolds. The PI will apply different versions of instanton Floer homology to the study of problems in low dimensional topology. The focus of the first part of the project is the Atiyah-Floer conjecture. This conjecture states that one can apply methods from symplectic geometry to define three-manifold invariants. Furthermore, the resulting invariant, often called symplectic instanton Floer homology, is isomorphic to instanton Floer homology. The PI and his collaborators will develop tools in symplectic topology which can be used to construct new types of symplectic instanton Floer homology. They will also use a certain partial differential equation, called the mixed equation, to address various versions of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture. Another goal of this project is to prove the existence of non-trivial representations of knot groups into the special unitary group SU(N). An outcome of this project would be to give gauge theoretical proofs of the Smith conjecture and the Covering Conjecture. The final goal of this project is to employ instanton Floer homology in the study of the homology cobordism group. The PI recently constructed a family of new invariants for the homology cobordism group using Yang-Mills gauge theory. The PI will apply these invariants to better understand the structure of the homology cobordism group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ionosphere is generally broken out by layers, defined according to the wavelengths of the radiation most commonly absorbed. The E-region extends from 90-150 km and is ionized through X-ray and ultraviolet radiation. The F-region (150-600 km) is ionized by extreme ultraviolet radiation. Although waves and disturbances (""structuring"") occur throughout the ionospheric medium (""plasma""), studies often focus on; either the E or F layer owing in part to limitations of experimental and theoretical; techniques employed. As a result, development of a unified view of ionospheric plasma structuring processes remains incomplete. This proposal will fill this gap by (1) developing a unified plasma instability theory applicable in the broad range of altitudes including the previously unexplored transitional valley region between the E and F region peaks and (2) observing the valley region with a radar that routinely receives returns from a broad range of altitudes. The proposed research leverages NSF assets and knowledge synthesis to contribute fundamentally to the theory of plasma instability and structuring. This knowledge is relevant to the communication and navigation industries, and therefore to society. The integrated theory will be incorporated into UAF plasma physics classes, that currently rely primarily on original journal publications rather than teaching modules. The proposal will also fund a new Ph.D. student.<br/><br/>The proposed research will address the fundamental question of what combination of destabilizing and stabilizing factors results in the plasma perturbations growing in amplitude and producing ionospheric structures. The actual proposal activity consists of three interconnected projects: 1. Development a unified theory of ionospheric plasma instabilities including thermal, inertial, and gradient effects for arbitrary altitude and propagation; 2. Determination of the critical gradient length required to destabilize plasma in the non-isothermal case for arbitrary altitude; 3. Analysis of SuperDARN and ISR data to investigate small-scale irregularity occurrence in the previously unexplored transitional ""valley"" region (~150 km).

For example, to understand the statement, ""Give me the book on AI on the table to your left,"" a robot needs to understand that the first ""on"" expresses the topic of the book, while the second ""on"" and the rest of the sentence convey spatial information. Next, it needs to work out the visual meaning of ""on"" to identify the correct book. Spatial language understanding is challenging because it requires meaning disambiguation, recognizing the links between referenced objects, and in most cases, background knowledge and common sense. This is particularly true for more complex sentences that include nesting relations or idioms containing spatial terms, like ""she is the top expert in her field."" The goal of this research is to develop techniques for the integration of machine learning and reasoning to advance spatial language comprehension. Solving this problem will provide tangible benefits to society in a wide variety of applications including healthcare (e.g., extracting biomedical information from patient reports and images), navigation and communication with assistant robots (particularly in risky situations like firefighter robots), situational awareness, information retrieval systems using various types of data, and geographical information systems.<br/><br/>Providing reasoning capabilities to machine learning models is highly challenging. The proposed research advances this issue in an important and broad sub-problem: spatial language understanding. To this aim, a generic domain-independent symbolic spatial meaning representation will be introduced, which covers the main spatial semantic concepts for a variety of tasks. Deep structured and relational learning techniques will be developed to obtain such representations. The proposed techniques will facilitate indirect supervision by exploiting visual resources, will use ontologies that convey common sense and will integrate the axioms of spatial qualitative reasoning in training structured representations. Such an approach helps to avoid massive and complex data annotation for training structured and complex models. This research will evaluate whether using formal spatial calculi models as an intermediate structured representation will improve spatial reasoning and deeper learning. The interaction between learning and spatial reasoning will be investigated, while exploiting both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations. The impact of integrating explicit spatial reasoning will be tested on textual and visual question-answering tasks with a focus on locative questions. The outcome of this research will advance the generalizability of current state-of-the-art deep learning models at a time when there is a lack of training examples for complex unobserved situations. This work will help bridge the gap between symbolic AI and deep ML to advance spatial language understanding.

As a direct result, there are now tens of thousands of publicly available data sets providing snapshots of how plants modulate the transcription of their genetic material to produce a phenotype. In order to appreciate the transcriptional complexity leading to phenotype, it is first necessary to understand the full composition of the transcriptome itself. Aside from protein-coding RNAs and small RNAs, a third class of transcript has recently been uncovered: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are emerging as key regulatory molecules impacting how plants respond to changes in their environment such as temperature and water abundance. Despite their many important roles, lncRNAs remain poorly annotated in plants. LncRNAs are difficult to predict from genomic sequence alone and often require extensive transcriptional information, and the capacity to process that data. To overcome difficulties in lncRNA annotation and functional classification, this project aims to mine all publicly available transcriptomic data for the fifteen most studied model and agriculturally significant plant species. LncRNAs will be identified, cross-species conservation will be determined, and putative functional pathways will be inferred in each of the fifteen species. These three data points (identification, conservation, and functional prediction) will not only provide a more holistic view of plant transcriptomes, but also help researchers studying the complex relationship between genome and phenome. This project initiates a novel bioinformatics and molecular biology training curriculum for undergraduates called LIVE for Plants, as well as a summer research component aimed at delivering an enhanced bioinformatic and molecular biology training to undergraduates. <br/><br/>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function in numerous developmental pathways in eukaryotes. In plants, lncRNAs are known for their roles in regulating responses to different environmental stimuli. The extent to which characterized plant lncRNAs represent the total suite of functional classes remains an open question. Moreover, the extent to which plant transcriptomes are composed of lncRNAs is also unknown, hindering discovery of new functional types. These gaps in knowledge are in part due to poor sampling in plants, as well as lack of a consistently applied methodology among identification efforts. This project aims to document and annotate lncRNA repertoires from fifteen angiosperms by mining > 100 terabases of publicly available RNA-seq data. This computational curation will entail identifying lncRNAs for each species and then annotating them based on expression, conservation, and predicted biological process. The bioinformatics workflow developed as part of this project will benefit other groups attempting similar large-scale curations in their own systems. All data and metadata will be disseminated through CyVerse's Data Store, with visualization provided by popular public resources such as EPIC-CoGe and BAR's eFP Browsers. Taken together, the project aims will yield an innovative resource of accessible and integrated information about plant lncRNAs, as well as the information and tools to identify lncRNAs with important biological functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first phase aims to learn more about the privacy needs of people with visual impairments through a combination of longitudinal diary studies, in which people record and answer questions about incidents where they felt their privacy was at risk, and observational studies of people with visual impairments and their help givers using technology in context.  The second phase looks to develop better privacy support tools; the team will focus first on privacy threat reminders and tools for privacy-respecting collaborative use as these are key issues that arose in preliminary work, but will also develop tools in response to the concerns identified in the first phase.  In each design activity, the researchers will use a participatory design approach that includes people with visual impairments (and when appropriate their help givers) on the design team, working together at both local disability support centers and at the research lab.  Designs will follow a standard iterative process, starting with initial requirements generation and review, moving through brainstorming and low-fidelity prototypes, and finally developing and testing high-fidelity prototypes.  The third phase involves using the results from the first two phases to generate guidelines for inclusive privacy design -- that is, general privacy guidelines that may apply to a wide range of user populations with varying abilities.  To do this, the team will conduct research similar to phase one, but with groups of older adults, people with cognitive impairments, and a group of younger people without disabilities; they will also test the privacy tools generated in phase two with these groups to both identify new issues that arise in these populations and modify the tools to be more broadly inclusive."

The aim of this project is to understand how the local environment (e.g., the environment in the host) affects pheromone signaling and bacterial behaviors such as colonization. This project combines molecular-based microbiology methods with physical and mathematical tools to develop a more complete experimental and theoretical picture of this process. The project will enhance education by training graduate and undergraduate students to perform cross-disciplinary laboratory research. These research experiences will prepare the students for a wide range of careers in the biosciences. The project also includes a formal training experience for secondary science teachers, primarily from high schools with large numbers of students from under-served populations. <br/><br/>The most important elements of Vibrio fischeri pheromone signaling are the LuxI/LuxR signal-synthase/receptor, which produces and detects a 3OC6 homoserine lactone (HSL) pheromone, and the AinS/AinR synthase/receptor system, which employs a C8 HSL pheromone to drive a different signaling cascade. The complexity of these systems is enhanced by the crosstalk generated by LuxR's recognition of both HSL signals, by the fact that both Lux and Ain are modulated in response to the environment, and by the presence of positive feedback in both the Lux and Ain cascades. The primary goal of this project is to understand how the system gathers and integrates information from its environment. The specific aims are to (i) understand how the pivotal regulator LuxR and its variants integrate information from the two HSL signals, (ii) identify the activation states of the broader pheromone-signaling circuitry and explore how environmental inputs lead to specific outputs, and (iii) test the hypothesis that the architecture of this signaling system allows spatially-heterogeneous environments to trigger population-wide responses over extended distance and time scales. The project will use cytometry and gene reporter methods to characterize LuxR interactions and system states. It will also use microfluidics and microscopy to explore signaling dynamics in heterogeneous environments. The results are expected to yield new insights into how bacteria use environmental cues to control population-level behaviors."

The damage from this tornado was concentrated in older low-income neighborhoods with many uninsured houses, limited government assistance, and low capacity to provide replacement housing within the community. This research examines recovery needs resulting from social vulnerability especially tenure and immigration. The results will assist planners, emergency managers, and policymakers to incorporate approaches within recovery programs that better communicate assistance eligibility criteria with immigrants. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to assist recovery of our most vulnerable populations after a disaster.<br/><br/>This research addresses gaps in the disaster literature with respect to low attention disasters that affect immigrants, renters and contract homeowners. Vulnerable households like immigrants and non-homeowners are at a disadvantage for accessing recovery assistance to complete home repairs and subsequently at a higher risk of long-term displacement. This project collects data to examine recovery experiences of immigrants and non-homeowners in the aftermath of the Marshalltown tornado that did not receive much attention and resources despite causing major damages in low income neighborhoods with a relatively higher percentage of minority, immigrant, and non-homeowner households. Hence, it offers a unique possibility for assessing the complex recovery challenges related to housing tenure and immigration after low attention disasters. Methods of data collection consist of conducting focus groups with households, one on one interviews, and participant observation. Analysis methods include qualitative coding of data through theme identification and constant comparison.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These evidence-based instructional practices (EBIPs) promote students' conceptual understanding and favorable attitudes about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with the greatest impacts observed among women and members of underrepresented groups. By improving retention rates and attracting a more diverse student population to the sciences, these research-based ways of teaching science can help address the national need to educate STEM-literate graduates and advance workforce development goals. The challenge is fostering the effective use of these teaching practices on a national scale. STEM faculty members are at the core of any successful instructional reform, yet surprisingly little is known about them with respect to their teaching. As extensive resources and efforts are currently focused on transforming STEM instructional practices at the college level nationally, there is a critical need to characterize STEM faculty members' knowledge base for teaching, instructional practices, relationships between the two, as well as progressions of this knowledge and these practices over time. Moreover, there is a need to characterize these progressions under varying reform environments (short workshops versus semester-long professional development; different departmental and institutional culture around teaching), as well as for faculty at various points of their academic career. Results of this foundational research will provide critical insight into the diverse progressions of STEM faculty members' knowledge base for teaching and instructional practices, which will inform current national and local reform efforts that aim at the widespread implementation of EBIPs in STEM courses in college settings.<br/><br/>This NSF Faculty Early Career Development project will address a wide gap in the discipline-based education research literature about STEM faculty members' knowledge base for teaching and instructional practices. Specifically, the project will characterize how STEM faculty members' practical theories and their integration with instructional practices evolve in the contexts of different (a) levels of experience as faculty members; (b) climate, culture, and rewards structures of departments and institutions; and (c) formal and informal professional development experiences. The research is grounded in the Teacher-Centered Systemic Reform Model, which describes faculty members' decision-making processes about teaching and influences impacting these processes. A convergent, longitudinal mixed methods design will be implemented to address the research questions. Quantitative data will include surveys, classroom observations, and course artifacts. The qualitative component will consist of an embedded collective case study. Data collected will include interviews with faculty and course artifacts. These research activities will result in an enhanced understanding of STEM faculty members' a) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) elements, b) orientations toward teaching and beliefs about teaching, and c) instructional practices, as well as d) alignment among these three constructs under various contexts (e.g., faculty at different levels of their academic career, faculty experiencing different types of departmental and institutional climate, and faculty participating in different types of formal and informal professional development). This foundational research will further inform the theoretical framework and provide critical insights on effective practices for STEM faculty professional development to the STEM community at large. The research and education program will be fully integrated: one component of the education program, a professional development program for STEM faculty at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), will serve as the context for part of the study; in turn, the results of the study will inform the design and implementation of the professional development program but will also provide opportunities to offer one-on-one teaching consultations with UNL STEM faculty and will inform the design of a graduate-level curriculum on reformed instructional practices."

Both the DNA and protein components of chromatin can be modified in the nucleus to produce ""chemical bookmarks.""  Cells can use these bookmarks, together with the information in the sequence of bases in the DNA, as instructions for switching genes on and off at the right time and in the right place.  How chemical bookmarks work is still unclear, but some studies have shown that misplaced bookmarks can contribute to the onset of different diseases.  The goal of this project is to understand how chemical bookmarks function.  The strategy will be to use synthetic biology to reprogram the bookmarks at desired regions of the DNA to change their switching behavior. This will help reveal how DNA bookmarking controls the fate and function of different cells.  The work will have educational impact by integrating students and scientists from engineering, computer sciences, chemistry and biology to uncover the principles by which information stored in chromatin is used to make different cell types and govern their function. The outcomes could have broader societal impact by contributing to development of methods for correcting disease-associated bookmarking errors, or by using synthetic switches to protect against organisms with DNA-based genomes - such as engineered viruses, bacteria and other pathogens - that may pose biological threats.<br/><br/>The central goal of this transformative and transdisciplinary project is to create nanoscale so-called ""epigenetic switches"" that can sculpt the chromatin nano-environment at targeted genomic loci.  This class of 2nm-scale switches can be programmed to rewire epigenetic states at specified loci and evoke informative and meaningful phenotypic outcomes. These epigenetic switches are composed of synthetic DNA binding polyamide molecules that can be programmed to target genomic sites embedded in diverse chromatin states. Moreover, using modular design, these synthetic genome readers can be conjugated to different small molecule ligands that mimic epigenetic signals or engage distinct cellular machines to rewire overlaid chromatin or epigenetic states.

Results will guide development of a computational model of speech planning and production that has the potential to accelerate the design of new therapeutic approaches to developmental and acquired disorders of speech. Additional benefits to society will accrue from a series of teaching modules that will be developed that explore the role of auditory feedback in normal and disordered speech.

The first research goal is to determine the role of delayed auditory feedback (DAF) on speech sequencing using multimodal experimental techniques. Acoustic data will be collected and analyzed to determine the impact of DAF on the production of non-word syllable sequences and sentences. These data will be used to assess the types of errors elicited by DAF and the relationship between these effects and responses to rapid shifts in the frequency content, rather than timing, of the feedback signal. The collected data and perceptual evaluations, obtained via a crowdsourcing platform, will enable the study of individual speaker variability. Data will also be made available as a large public database of speech under altered feedback conditions. The second research goal is to develop a computational model, informed also by kinematic measures of speech from a subset of participants, that can capture the interaction of auditory feedback with speech sequence production. The model will simulate a series of hypotheses about the interactions among speech perception and planning and production components and assess their ability to account for the patterns of errors observed in the experimental data.

These theories can be used to get information about the homology cobordism group in three dimensions. In turn, homology cobordism gives insight into the classification of triangulations for manifolds of dimension at least five.

For example, when two conductive plates or surfaces are brought together they either repel or attract each other depending on whether they have the same or opposite electric charges.  If they are uncharged, there is no electrical force between them.  However, this classical picture breaks down when the surfaces are brought very close together with a gap of a few nanometers.  At that small distance the electric field between the surfaces exhibits quantum effects and there is a small but measureable force between them.  This is called the Casimir effect, named after the scientist who explained how the quantized electromagnetic field results in a force between uncharged surfaces.  Understanding various types of Casimir forces is important for our fundamental knowledge of quantum physics and for applications to materials used in micro- and nano-technologies.  This project will study a phenomenon referred to as the Casimir torque in which the two surfaces are caused to rotate.  The research team will demonstrate and quantify how materials with different optical properties experience the Casimir torque.  <br/> <br/>Despite the pervasive nature of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and their influence on nanoscale science and engineering, control of fluctuation-induced phenomena is difficult. Here it is proposed to test several hypotheses and predictions related to the Casimir torque, which will lead to the generation of new knowledge about controlling these interactions. The first test will be of the hypothesis that the measured torque can be strengthened by increasing the optical anisotropy of the two materials. The second test will be of the hypothesis that the direction of rotation depends on whether the optical axis of a birefringent material has an index of refraction that is higher or lower than that of its extraordinary axis. The third will be to explore the idea of using the Casimir force to translate lateral motion into rotational motion. These experiments will not only advance the science related to quantum phenomena but will also lead to new experimental techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Zoonoses currently account for approximately 75 percent of all emerging infections worldwide. However, the factors that trigger zoonotic disease emergence and spread remain poorly understood, in part because they involve multiple species, complex inter-species and intra-species relationships, and many interacting environmental, behavioral, social, and economic factors. Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents a case in point. MERS-CoV was first identified in human beings in 2012 and has killed 36 percent of those infected, but little is known about what has led to its emergence. For example, several human cases have been traced to contact with camels imported from Africa; studies also have detected MERS-CoV in African wildlife; and while camels are a known reservoir host for MERS-CoV, it is not known if there are additional reservoirs or intermediate hosts, or how frequently and under what conditions MERS-CoV spillover occurs. This project will investigate the natural ecology of MERS-CoV in relation to broader social, economic, and environmental changes; its potential wildlife reservoirs in close contact with camels; and the potential for spillover to humans who consume, herd, and trade camels and camel products. This work is of direct importance to national security with respect to disease threats; MERS-CoV is currently on the World Health Organization's priority shortlist of diseases in urgent need of accelerated research.  <br/><br/><br/>To understand when and under what conditions MERS-CoV emerges and spreads from animals to humans, the researchers ask, (1) How do social, cultural and behavioral characteristics of camel economics shape virus ecologies? (2) Which intra- and inter-species interactions increase MERS-CoV emergence and transmission? and (3) What climatic and environmental variables are associated with transmission? Researchers will conduct field studies of wild and domestic (camel) reservoirs, collecting roughly 800 samples from targeted wildlife (ungulates and eulipotyphlads) over two years at four locations. They will carry out socio-behavioral studies across the camel value chain and follow individual camels longitudinally to determine when the same individuals seroconvert to MERS-CoV positive status. They will conduct laboratory analyses and do viral sequencing. The researchers will integrate the data into mathematical models using the 'Method of Plausible Parameter Sets' (MPPS), which will determine which mechanistic scenarios are consistent with observed patterns of MERS-CoV in camels and humans. This broadly inclusive approach expands upon traditional studies of zoonotic disease emergence. The transmission models will be applicable to other zoonotic diseases linked to livestock production and will help to identify interventions to reduce disease emergence and transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, attentional demands are high on such teams, raising questions of how to both monitor those attentional demands and develop systems that adaptively provide needed information not just through visual displays that are often overloaded, but through other senses including touch and sound.  Most existing work on adaptive multimodal interfaces for situational awareness focuses on individuals; this project will address how to do this work for teams, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) search and rescue as its primary domain.  This includes developing conceptual models that connect individual and team-level situational awareness, algorithms that use eye gaze data to assess both situational awareness and workload in real-time, and multimodal display guidelines that adaptively present information to the most appropriate team members through the most effective modes.  This work will fundamentally advance research on understanding and designing to support team interaction, leading to practical improvements in a variety of safety-critical domains.  The project also has a significant educational component, providing research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students and conducting design activities aimed at outreach and broadening participation in STEM disciplines, including workstation design to support teams of people with disabilities in manufacturing contexts.<br/><br/>The research work has two main thrusts.  The first involves collecting baseline data through a study where pairs of novices are trained to carry out simulated UAV search and rescue tasks using a standard visually-focused interface; the team will collect situational awareness (SA) assessments using existing validated surveys, eye gaze data, and team interaction data and member characteristics.  This data will be used to build two main models.  The first is a model that relates team dynamics and individual member characteristics with levels of SA and performance, using qualitative analysis of recorded observational and audio data, along with focus group interviews with participants.  The second is a quantitative model that attempts to predict SA using eye gaze data, using both a factor analysis of eye gaze data and Markovian models of how teams and their members transition their visual attention between interface elements and tasks to predict levels of SA.  These models will support unobtrusive assessments of SA that avoid the interruptions imposed by existing surveys and are necessary for developing the adaptive multimodal interfaces that are the other main thrust of the project.  This second thrust will use the models of attention and problematic tasks and contexts identified in the first study to iteratively develop a pilot suite of multimodal interfaces that combine visual, audio, and tactile information channels.  These multimodal interfaces will be evaluated using a series of studies similar to the first set, with the goal of developing cost-benefit models for presentation modes and types of information that minimally interfere with teams' existing visual workload while still providing information that raises individual and team SA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since analog encryption techniques are more power efficient, this approach makes it possible to avoid the use of microprocessors and consequently facilitate the realization of more portable devices.<br/><br/>While the idea of encrypting information via chaotic signals is at least three decades old, only relatively recent technological advancements in circuit fabrication allow the practical implementation of chaotic encryption over a wireless channel.

Another technological innovation brought by the project is the creation of mechanisms for coordinated communications among multiple devices over the same chaotically encrypted channel using cognitive radio.<br/><br/>The impact at large of these methods can be significant. For example, embedding analog encryption techniques in biomedical devices increases the privacy and comfort of patients since data are going to be transmitted wirelessly over a secure channel.

It is driven by applications in gas dynamics and plasma physics as well by mathematical interests in analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. Kinetic equations are used to describe evolution of interacting particles, such as gas molecules, ions and electrons in a plasma. The most famous kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation: formulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in 1872, this equation describes motion of a large class of gases. Later, in 1936 Lev Landau derived from the Boltzmann equation a new mathematical model for motion of plasma. This latter equation was named the Landau equation. Despite the fact that many mathematicians and physicists have been working on these equations, many important questions are still unanswered due to their mathematical complexity. The proposed research will fundamentally contribute to this field by bridging the gap between mathematical analysis and physics and enable further mathematical understanding of physical phenomena. The work will be enhanced by collaborations at the national and international levels and will help strengthen inter-institutional ties. The research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities designed to (i) broaden the students' understanding of different research areas, (ii) provide the students with a modern skill set that is essential for different career paths, and (iii) promote existing connections between local institutions in the DC Metro area and help establish new avenues for collaboration and training of high quality scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance the knowledge in global properties of solutions to collisional kinetic mathematical models, improving our understanding of non-linear dynamics, entropy, equilibrium, and regularizing effects. The corresponding equations contain integro-differential operators that are highly nonlinear, singular and with degenerating coefficients. Integro-differential equations of this type have received increased attention recently: well-posedness and regularity theory are being developed since many new applications have emerged, among which conformal geometry, stochastic control and image processing. The project aims at advancing knowledge in the theories of kinetic equations, nonlocal integro-differential operators and degenerate differential operators."

The infected plant or animal is called a ""host"" and the infecting organism is called a ""pathogen"".  The interaction between hosts and pathogens is important to understand because it often determines one's health. Scientists are now becoming aware that the host-pathogen interaction is more complicated because one host can be infected by many pathogens, all of whom interact with each other as well as with the host.  Likewise, one type of pathogen can infect several types of hosts, and how one host responds can influence whether another host becomes infected.  Figuring out how all this plays out in Nature requires carefully designed experiments and mathematical models and this project provides both.  Developing a deeper understanding of hosts and pathogens is critical because humans are dramatically altering the biological world, introducing new types of hosts and pathogens in some areas and removing them from others. Understanding how such gains and losses of organisms influences the spread of disease is important to the fields of conservation science and public health. This research program will train undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in the fields of disease ecology and mathematical biology, and will engage the public through a variety of outreach activities. <br/><br/>Humans are impacting biodiversity patterns globally and these changes can influence the risk and prevalence of infectious diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic multi-host multi-pathogen epidemiological theory that explains how between-host and between-pathogen competition jointly shape disease dynamics.  To determine how competition alters the amplification or dilution of diseases, mathematical models will be developed and tested using planktonic species and their associated pathogens via laboratory based mesocosm and field experiments. This work will both extend current theory on multi-host and multi-pathogen communities as well as unify theory developed independently for diseases with different transmission modes.  The theory-data pairing approach of this study is likely to generate important advances in epidemiological theory and disease ecology. This work will also yield insight into how future alterations to diversity will affect disease outbreaks in humans and wildlife.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By non-invasive observations, it is meant that what is being measured is not the system reaction to actively injected inputs, but rather the system behavior when it is operating under standard conditions and subject to potentially unobservable forcing signals. The capability of designing controllers based only on non-invasive observations is of paramount importance for any large scale network fulfilling critical or uninterruptible functions (i.e., a power grid, a logistic system) or in situations where it is impractical or too expensive to inject known probing signals into the system (i.e., a gene network, a financial network). Other relevant applications are in medicine (i.e., repeated drug testing, computer- assisted anesthesia). Indeed, in these cases, for obvious safety and health concerns, it is not desirable to actively test the response of a patient to a different drug dosage or treatment, if comparably useful information could be inferred from non-invasive observations.<br/><br/>Since non-invasive observations do not always provide full information about the network's configuration, the project will also consider how to define adequate control mechanisms that are robust with respect to uncertainties in the connectivity structure. These kinds of uncertainties are not typically considered in standard techniques for control design and the development of specific methodologies is required. Combined with the capability of adapting to changes in the network's configuration, these control techniques will provide a solid foundation for the realization of a self-healing system. This project will bridge together different areas, including statistics, computer science, and control theory with a single unifying framework. New courses will be created to facilitate communication among all these communities of researchers, advancing separate fields in a multidisciplinary way."

Family caregivers often report increased anxiety and depression, and many forego their own health needs as the demands of being a family caregiver are sustained over many years. It is also known that poor interactions between patient and caregiver increase the difficulty of providing care. Monitoring reactivity between patient and caregiver could signal when problematic interactions might occur. Just-in-time or even predictive recommendations in those moments could improve these interactions and reduce strain on caregivers. This project develops a monitoring, modeling, and interactive recommendation solution (for caregivers) for in-home dementia patient care that focuses on caregiver-patient relationships. This includes monitoring for mood and stress and analyzing the significance of monitoring those attributes to dementia patient care and subsequent behavior dynamics between patient and caregiver. In addition, novel and adaptive behavioral suggestions at the right moments aim at helping improve familial interactions related to caregiving, which over time should ameliorate the stressful effects of the patient's illness and decrease strain on caregivers. This work could also benefit nursing homes and assisted living facilities by improving care for their residents, and could be useful for other caregiving situations, including the care of children with emotional/behavioral challenges who are cared for at home by their families. Educational modules introduce both healthcare students and technology students to this multidisciplinary area of research.<br/><br/>The technical solution consists of a core set of statistical learning based techniques for automated generation of specialized modules required by in-home dementia patient care. Personalization, context, and stages of dementia all contribute to the need for specialized modules; and without new solutions for rapid and automatic generation of these specialized modules, progress in effective treatment and patient/caregiver relationship improvement will be very difficult and slow. There are three main technical components in the solution. The first obtains textual content and prosody from voice and uses machine learning techniques to create classification models. This approach not only monitors patients' behavior, but also caregivers', and infers the underlying dynamics of their interactions, such as changes in mood and stress. The second is the automated creation of classifiers and inference modules tailored to the particular patients and dementia conditions (such as different stages of dementia). The third is an adaptive recommendation system that closes the loop of an in-home behavior monitoring system. The main technical contribution is the quick and accurate development of personalized smart and connected health platforms and the potential for reduced medical costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
